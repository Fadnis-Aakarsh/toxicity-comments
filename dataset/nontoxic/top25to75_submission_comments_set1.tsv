72330	0	a	"So, I was curious because this was high on my front page and there were no answers, so I did a quick search. I found a paper discussing the effects that the 1918 flu pandemic had on Iran, and it included some background about the effect of WWI on the Iranian populace as well. A lot of this post is taken directly from this article, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased. (The citation is : Amir Afkhami. ""Compromised Constitutions: The Iranian Experience with the 1918 Influenza Pandemic."" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 77, no. 2 (2003): 367-392. https://muse.jhu.edu/)  So Iran declared its neutrality during WWI, but despite this the great powers used Iran as a battlefield at times. Russia and Britain both had imperialist designs on Iran for various reasons, interfering with its internal politics to try and secure their own interests, and as a result it became a target during the war. Some of the incidents during the war include: the Ottomans chasing the Russians into northwestern Azerbaijan in 1914; In 1915 Wilhelm Wassmuss organized a revolt among the Qashghai tribesman in southern Iran against the British who controlled oilfields in the area; The Russians counterattacked the Ottomans allowing the British to recover control of Southern Iran by 1916; A revolutionary Iranian group called the Jangalis emerged to control the countryside of Gilan in 1917-1918; Britain also tried to use Iran as a springboard to attack Russia in an attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the new Soviet Union responded by annexing parts of northern Iran.  As a result of the warfare occurring in Iran, there was damage to Iran's economic, industrial and agricultural power. The occupying armies forcefully requisitioned or looted supplies. This led to widespread famine and the spread of disease. Iran's government was also essentially a protectorate surviving at the whims of whichever power was present and winning at the time, leaving them with little ability to actually help their own people. In addition, Ahmad Shah Qajar, the ruler of Iran at the time, was a weak ruler with little influence in his own government. The populace resented his father for authoritarian policies, and in an attempt to address this, Ahmad Shah tried to appoint only the best ministers, but he was unable to control their actions. In the face of the great powers of WWI using their country as a battlefield, and the threat of the Soviet Invasion and their humiliating demands, the populace resented the government's weakness, contributing to the political instability.  While political instability and warfare can lead to famines, the biggest cause is often climatic. 1916 and 1917 were both years with very dry summers, leading to crop failures. This, coupled with the foreign armies seizing what food they could, resulted in widespread famine, which was worsened by hoarders and speculators. When the influenza pandemic broke out in the spring of 1918, grain supplies had hit a low point, prices had doubled from six months before, (which had reached a ten-year peak). In addition, there were outbreaks of bubonic plague, cholera, malaria and typhus. The British were also building up for their attack on the Soviet Union, and sponsoring a native military contingent known as the ""South Persia Rifles"", making long-term contracts with large landowners for grain to feed the troops, adding to the scarcity.  F.A.C. Forbes-Leith describes the situation in what I assume is a memoir, Checkmate: Fighting Tradition in Central Persia. (I haven't read the actual book and am using a citation from Afkhami's article).  >""The country was in a terrible state and the peasantry was in the last stages of starvation. Every time I was forced to stop my car, I was surrounded by hundreds of near-skeletons who screamed and fought for such scraps as I was able to spare. In a single day's journey of fifty-six miles between the towns of Kirind and Kermanshah, I counted twenty-seven corpses by the roadside, most of them those of women and children, and the general condition of life amongst the peasants was so frightful that I was ashamed to eat my simple rations in their presence.""  So the Iranian famine of 1917-1918 was primarily a man-made catastrophe exacerbated by climatic conditions in which there was also an influx of infectious diseases. The wikipedia listing states that Majd's initial population estimate of 19 million is called into question with other estimates only being 11 million. Afkhami's article says that Iran's projected population at the beginning of 1918 was 11 million, so it may be that the 19 million number comes from *before* WWI broke out, and after the famine it had hit 11 million, at which point the influenza pandemic hit, killing a further 8% to 21% of the population according to Afkhami. (0.8 to 2.3 million). Although Afkhami's footnotes say that the population in 1918 was not too different from the population in 1913, before the war, which I am not sure whether to believe or not, given the effects of famine prior to the flu's arrival."
72331	0	a	Just from reading what little i've found, there was definitely was a famine that's been overlooked/ignored by a lot of modern scholars, similar to the 1943 Bengal Famine (which has only recently been approached by modern historians).   Most of the blame apparently lies on the Turkish and Russian forces fighting there during the war who foraged so heavily the local Persian populace wasn't even left with a seed crop for the following years. Tie this in with inclement weather (snowfall it looks like) and hoarding, Persia really was strapped for food post-Occupation.
72332	0	a	Do you think it is possible that Majd was conflating numbers of fatalities caused directly by the famine and those by the Spanish Flu, which occurred during the same time? In literature that I have sourced, the Spanish flu (1918) seems to have been exacerbated by the presence of British-Indian troops stationed in Iran, after it had entered Iran already from the north and from the west. To quote:      > As Afhkami pointed out, the total estimated death from the 1918 Spanish influenza in Iran was between 902,400 and 2,431,000, but the real figure was probably between the two mentioned extremes.2       Source: Azizi, Jalali and Azizi, *A history of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and its impact on Iran*, Arch Iran Med. 2010 May;13(3):262-5.

[They even parodied it.](http://i.imgur.com/QYcaDFv.jpg)  The British Library's Medieval Manuscripts blog, which I will shill for every chance I get, has some more great examples [here](http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2013/09/knight-v-snail.html).
72334	0	a	"According to the late, great art historian Michael Camille (in his book ""Image on the Edge""), there have been a number of theories behind the iconographic motif of the snail in 13th, 14th, and early 15th century marginalia. Citing other historians and art historians, he mentions parallels with the story of the Raising of Lazarus, individuals cloistered away in the safety of fortified castles, the Lombards, social climbers, and more lewd, sexual interpretations. For more, see [""Image on the Edge"",](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ax9WAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=image+on+the+edge&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwikoZidxaXJAhVGOiYKHcQpA1AQ6AEIMDAA#v=onepage&q=image%20on%20the%20edge&f=false) pp. 31-36.  (as an aside, the snail motif appears in late 15th century 'trompe l'oeil' marginalia, but Camille dismisses this era of medieval illuminated margins as ""The End of the Edge"" in the last chapter his book--one of my quibbles with his work)."

72338	0	a	"Medieval iconography certainly had its types and tropes--I'm not sure if it was deliberate, but the bald head and the beard on the snail in the image I linked look iconographically like St. Paul ([here he is](http://i.imgur.com/xEVZI4a.png) in Monreale Cathedral in Sicily, built by the Normans who hired artists trained in Byzantine mosaic technique to adorn its interior). But the thing about the snails is, they're not always deployed the same way. Sometimes you have a knight jousting a BIG snail, sometimes you have a yelling angry snail on its own, sometimes you have a knight jousting a little snail, sometimes you have other animals jousting on top of snails.  Where we see jousting snails and other miscellany like this is decorative borders and random illustrations in luxury manuscripts. I tend to think of them a little bit like the cartoons and random drawings in the New Yorker--little illuminations that don't illustrate the text. There's a couple decades in the 1300s, for example, where adding strawberries to borders suddenly became A Thing--and then it stopped.  Jousting snails are especially common on the edges of Psalters and Books of Hours--that is, prayer books, that people were meant to read over and over and over. And luxury expensive ones, often intended for display. Would a jousting snail be something to smile at, for the artist in the course of illumination or the reader in the course of contemplating the Passion? Would it be like the lyrics of ""Stairway to Heaven,"" something that each new reader could find meaning in, or that could mean different things to the same reader on a different day?"
72339	0	a	"I'm partial to the explanation of Medievalist Lisa Spangenberg, [who suggests](http://www.digitalmedievalist.net/) that the snail is ""a reminder of the inevitability of death.""   To understand that reference, you have to refer to [Psalm 58 (Wycliffe translation)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+58&version=WYC). We're looking here at verses 7-8:  >7 They shall come to nought, as water running away; he bent his bow, till they be made sick. (They shall come to nothing, like water running forth; and when they go to bend their bows, they shall be made feeble, or weak.)  >8 As wax that floateth away, they shall be taken away; fire fell above, and they saw not the sun. **(Like a snail that melteth away into slime, they shall be taken away; like a dead-born child, they shall not see the sun.)**  Like the snail, even the best-armored knight will melt away. /u/sunagainstgold is a lot more familiar with this subject than I am; Spangenberg's work sticks in my mind."

People in medieval Europe enjoyed poking fun at themselves. (Yes, even clerics.) A knight jousting a snail could be a humorous reminder of the futility of the worldly role in the face of greater spiritual matters."
72344	0	a	"The USSR had an extensive civil defence organisation, which developed from Local Anti-Air Defence or MPVO (Местная противовоздушная оборона - МПВО) initiated in 1932. You might be interested to know that in autumn 1940, the MPVO was organised as part of the NKVD, the secret police, by order № 001378. They were especially active during the siege of Leningrad collecting firewood, organizing the evacuation of the disabled, assisting the victims of bombing, burying bodies, distributing gas masks and training the population in their use. The MPVO in Leningrad was commanded mostly by women (1,500 by the end of 1942). When the Axis were driven out of the USSR, they also assisted in minesweeping, according to the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations [1].  When the original ""Duck and Cover"" film was being shown in the United States in 1951, the Volunteer Society for Cooperation with the Army, Aviation, and Navy or DOSAAF (Добровольное Общество Содействия Армии, Авиации и Флоту - ДОСААФ) was organised in the USSR. DOSAAF was a technically voluntary paramilitary organisation aimed at teaching skills of military value to the population, especially to the young - there was a lot of overlap between DOSAAF and the Komsomol, the political youth organisation of the USSR. Activities included fitness and sport, marksmanship, radio operation, driving, first aid, as well as military study. In 1952, it was estimated that 15 million people were DOSAAF members [**edit:** according to Leon Gouré in his work for the RAND Corporation in the US, rather than estimates closer to the USSR]. In 1955, there was reportedly a renewed push for membership and an emphasis on civil defence - physically fit men from 16 to 60 and women from 16 to 55 were liable for civil defence training in partnership with their school or workplace [2]. Also at this time, the MPVO was directed towards civil defence, with different services (for public order, firefighting, communications, etc.) drawn from police departments, fire departments, TV and radio operators, etc. There were also ""self-defence groups"" drawn on a compulsory basis from men between 16-60 and women between 18-55 who were not liable for obligatory military service or deferred from the draft. Exemptions were made for pregnant women, the sick and disabled, among others. In an emergency, the MPVO would be ""supplemented by large numbers of ordinary citizens who have been trained by DOSAAF and can be instantly mobilised."" [3] **Edit:** We'll never know how effective Soviet civil preparedness would have been in the event of a nuclear attack - this kind of mass mobilisation and organisation would likely not have been realistic. But certainly the idea behind DOSAAF was to instruct the population in civil defence skills.  Only in 1961 was the MPVO reorganised into the official Civil Defence of the USSR. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in October of that year stated that there was little effort in actual shelter and evacuation plans, with the Soviets at that time relying on WWII-era shelters and subways in Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev. The Bulletin made a point that the difference in population density and industrial concentration with the US meant the USSR had less need of such plans. Osgood Caruthers of the New York Times reported from the USSR that ""nowhere in Moscow or any other city visited by foreigners can one find signs pointing to shelters... no practice alerts are held... posters are extremely rare... [and there is] no such thing as an effort on a citywide basis to organize block crews or house wardens for civil defense"" [4]. However, the CIA produced a report in May 1961 stating the USSR was spending between $500 million and $1.5 billion annually on civil defence, with a large part invested in shelter construction, in a program started 10 years beforehand [5]. According to the St Petersburg publication Fontanka, 4,003 bomb shelters remained in the city in 2010, 2,873 thereof located under residential housing [6].  In the later years of the 60s, Soviet Civil Defence had begun to produce short films similar to ""Duck and Cover"" advising citizens and schoolchildren what to do in the event of an attack, you can see cards at the electronic archive of the Russian National Children's Library (click one and then click ""Перейти к просмотру"") [7]. The film ""Главное - не растеряться"" (""Most Importantly - Stay Strong"") in 1968 shows Soviet methods to withstand an atomic attack on a city, with Civil Defence leading people to designated shelters and evacuating to the countryside afterwards [8]. Another film made as late as 1989 goes into detail about the evacuation plans [9]. Civil Defence were also producing literature such as ""Everyone Should Know And Be Able To Do This"" (Это должен знать и уметь каждый) in 1983 [10]. **Edit:** Soviet film production for higher education also produced informative films in the late 70s-80s such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sRzfmgu5A).  According to a survey of Soviet emigrants in the 1980s, 41.3% remembered where the civil defence shelter closest to their job or school had been, 29.3% had gone to a shelter during a drill in the last two years of their time in the USSR and 8.1% had even taken part in an evacuation drill, leaving town temporarily [11]. The authors of the survey note that these are all in the minority, so preparedness was perhaps not so thorough in the USSR at the time.

72345	0	a	"I wouldn't call it ""hysteria"" (""exaggerated or uncontrollable emotion or excitement"") — the USA and the USSR both _were_ threatened by the possibility of nuclear war. The USSR even more than the USA for most of it; the USA [ringed the USSR with airbases full of nuclear-armed bombers](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/US-nuclear-bomber-deployments-1945-1958.jpg) by the 1950s, with war plans that would leave the USSR a ""smoking, radiating ruin at the end of two hours,"" as one of the US officers involved in the planning put it. This was followed up by ICBMs, short-range nuclear missiles, submarine-launched missiles, atomic artillery, etc. Through the 1960s, the balance of nuclear strength was disproportionately in the US's favor; only in the 1970s was there a real ""parity"" in terms of both sides being able to inflict identical damage to one another, though even by the 1960s the USSR was capable of doing great harm to the USA.   I would not consider fallout shelters, duck and cover, etc., to be ""hysterical"" under those circumstances: they were part of the US Civil Defense program, the goal of which was to try and mitigate (as much as possible) the effects of a nuclear exchange that the politicians felt may not be preventable, to keep as much of the US ""alive"" after it so that recovery might be to some degree possible. It is easy to laugh at this stuff in retrospect when you do not respect the very real sense of danger that existed at the time, though I have found in recent months that Americans are getting a taste for that feeling once again. Many of the Cold War CD policies were flawed in many ways (e.g. city evacuation was just not going to work for major metropolises), many were only of relative help (e.g. they would not save everyone but would lower the number of casualties), many were very specific to their specific strategic moment (_Duck and Cover_ is good advice for 1951, but it was inadequate by the 1960s, when the size and power of the Soviet arsenal was larger, and fallout the more pertinent ""survivable"" threat). It is unfortunately very misunderstood, having turned into a political hot potato in the US and Europe by both the left and the right in the 1980s.   That out of the way, your question comes down to, ""were there Soviet Civil defense programs, public service announcements, etc.?"" And the answer is: yes. The Soviet Union did have Civil Defense programs that were similar in many ways to the American ones. They had fallout shelters, public blast shelters, various forms of public education programs that were aimed at schoolchildren and adults alone, etc. I am not aware of anything quite as kitschy as _Duck and Cover_, which is extreme kitsch by any standard. The most famous Soviet Civil Defense document in the West is _[Grazhdanskaya Oborona](http://bunker-datacenter.com/plakat.go/)_ (""Civil Protection""), a textbook of Civil Defense (this one from 1986, but apparently it was first issued originally in 1970), which is rather beautiful to my eyes, illustrated in the _lubok_ style of a peasant woodcut.  The real historical question about Soviet Civil Defense was, how ""for real"" was it? In the 1970s and 1980s there were accusations by hawks in the US that the Soviet CD program was lightyears beyond the (always anemic) US program, and that Soviet strategists felt nuclear war was thus ""survivable"" and would be more willing to wage it. While the Soviet CD program was definitely better-funded than the American one — no great feat given how much of a low priority CD was (the US fallout shelter program was, ultimately, aimed at convincing people to _build their own_ — indeed, much of the US program was no more than an information campaign, not a real infrastructure project), there is no evidence that they regarded it as any serious ""hedge"" or incorporated it into a more belligerent warfighting strategy, and how ""useful"" it was is rather debatable.  He will have a book out on this soon, I believe, but in the meantime, the best comparative history of the US and Soviet Civil Defense programs is Edward M. Geist, ""Two World of Civil Defense: State, Society, and Nuclear Survival in the USA and USSR, 1945-1991,"" Ph.D. diss., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2013. For what it is worth, I think the most important aspect of Civil Defense in the United States is that it caused Americans to face up, with some sobering honesty, about the possibility of nuclear war; to this end, I am one of the launchers of the [Reinventing Civil Defense Project](http://reinventingcivildefense.org) which seeks to think about what Civil Defense might look like, and ought to look like, in the 21st century."

72349	0	a	"This is a very interesting question. In an environment of fiercely hostile states competing for supremacy, it doesn't really make sense for a successful general to write down his knowledge for all to read. And any ruler who got hold of such a document would find it in his best interests to surpress it. So how did a text on military methods end up as one of the most famous and widely read texts from Ancient China?  In many ways, the 孫子兵法 (*Sun Zi Bing Fa*, ""Master Sun's Art of War"") is not the most promising place to look for an answer. The origins of the work are shrouded in mystery; the author may or may not be historical; the manuscript tradition is fraught with difficulties; the text itself was summed up by Robin Yates as ""terse and obscure"" and by Victor Mair as ""extraordinarily terse and maddeningly obscure"". We'll have to dig into these issues a bit if we are to get any sense of what the *Sun Zi* was meant to achieve.  First, the origins. At first glance, this question seems easy to answer: in his 史記 (*Shi Ji*, ""Records of the Grand Historian""), the Han Dynasty scholar Sima Qian tells us that the *Sun Zi* was written around the early 5th century BC by a famous general called Sun Wu. Sima Qian offers some delightful biographical details of this Sun Wu, including the famous story of how he trained the concubines of the king of Wu in heavy infantry drill. The notion that there was indeed a historical Master Sun, who wrote his treatise on warfare at the end of the Spring and Autumn Period, is still held by many. If we adopt this view, the answer to your question is relatively simple: a fugitive from the northern state of Qi (according to one version of the story), Sun Wu needed to impress his new master the king of Wu, and apart from his display as a drillmaster, the compilation of his Thirteen Chapters (the *Sun Zi*) would have provided evidence of his abilities. The biographical tradition helpfully notes that his advice and leadership allowed Wu to expand and conquer its neighbour, Chu.   The problem with this account of the genesis of the *Sun Zi* is that there is no earlier account of the life of a general named Sun Wu, and that the very practice of assigning authors to works is not something the Chinese actually did until after the end of the Spring and Autumn period. The find of a collection of texts on strips of bamboo - the traditional recording method - in a group of graves dating to the late 2nd century BC has confirmed that the *Sun Zi* existed more or less in its currently known form at that time, but there is no evidence that would support a date as early as the 400s BC. Moreover, if it did date that far back, it would be *by far* the earliest Chinese military treatise, with a gap of well over a century between it and its oldest successor.   Indeed, the text itself has been shown to reflect the military practice of the Warring States period (c. 475-221 BC), not the Spring and Autumn period (c. 771-476 BC) in which it was supposedly written. The well-organised, well-drilled infantry armies envisioned by Master Sun do not belong to the era of chariot-borne warlords and their loose entourages that was the Spring and Autumn period. Its references to crossbows must place it in the period after these weapons were invented (sometime in the 4th century BC). In other words, the text is far more likely to be a product of the 4th century BC than the early 5th; as far as we can tell, the spread and recognition of the work as a military classic belongs to the early Han Dynasty.  It is not surprising, then, that Chinese scholars as early as the 13th century AD have wondered whether the legendary author of the *Sun Zi* ever really existed. Many modern experts have been persuaded by Jens Østergard Petersen's argument that the details of Sima Qian's biography of Sun Wu are generic, and that all its elements can be found in biographies of other generals too. Sun Wu's name (effectively meaning something like ""wandering warrior"") is considered too convenient, and his historical context too vague, to take him seriously as a character of the late Spring and Autumn period. In fact, there is robust evidence of the existence of a general and military expert with the surname Sun - but his first name was Bin, and he lived well over a century after the alleged time in which Sun Wu flourished, and he is credited with writing an entirely separate treatise on military matters, which was rediscovered in the same collection that gave us the earliest extant traces of the *Sun Zi*. It seems all too likely that the family name Sun, famously associated with military expertise, became attached to a growing collection of martial wisdom compiled over the course of the Warring States period. The opening of each chapter of the text with the formula ""Master Sun said:"" is paradoxically an indication that there was never a ""Master Sun"" - only a succession of authors legitimising their wisdom through his reputation. Predictably, Sun Bin was eventually credited with being a descendant of the legendary Sun Wu, whose wisdom clearly ran in the family.  The fact is that the way of recording Ancient Chinese texts, using the strips of bamboo mentioned above, is extremely conducive to this sort of textual tradition. Single strips of bamboo contain no more than one or a few lines of text; the strips are held together with string. As the string breaks or decays, texts become jumbled, with later editors often totally unable to restore them to their original order. From our point of view, it is shockingly easy for lines to be added or lost. One of the frustrating things about the *Sun Zi* is that much of its metatext - its ""next""s and ""therefore""s - don't actually make any sense, and that not enough serious philological study has been devoted to restoring the text. Given its many uncertainties, we are on far safer ground to assume that the work is the product of many hands over a long period (roughly the 4th and early 3rd centuries BC) than that it is the work of a single, legendary military genius.  So where does that leave us with regard to your question? Why was the *Sun Zi* written? Who benefitted from writing it and spreading it around?  Here we find a useful parallel in the tradition of Ancient Greek literature. In Greece, as in China, military treatises did not develop in a vaccuum, when a particular military mastermind decided to commit his wisdom to the ages. Rather, they began to appear in an era that saw a general shift in notions of learning, in which oral tradition and abstract thought began to gave way to practical written works that allowed knowledge in discreet fields of expertise to be replicated and taught. In Greece, as in China, the art of war was swept up in this movement by the conditions of the age: in Greece, the hegemonic wars of the Classical period (of which the Peloponnesian War seems to have been especially important as a driving force), and in China, the prolonged and devastating Warring States period. In both cultures, the earliest written works of philosophy had appeared some time before, and kickstarted a tradition of recording advanced thought for the benefit of others. It is not surprising to find Chinese catalogues grouping the *Sun Zi* in the Daoist (that is, philosophical) tradition. It and the many other military treatises that appeared soon after all fit into the same new approach to the spread of knowledge. The purpose of the text was to teach, so that future generations facing military problems would not have to reinvent the wheel.  ---  **Sources**  * R.D.S.

A famous example is 民可使由之不可使知之 from Chapter 8 of the analects of Confucius. There are many ways to how to add particles to the sentence, let long how the interpret them.    1. 民可使由之，不可使知之   A positive translation will be ""You can guide the mass, but do not need to let them know why. "" A negative translation will be ""The people can be ruled, but not enknowlegded.""    2. 民可，使由之；不可，使知之。   Then the translation will be ""for the capable people, let them do what they want. For the incapable people, enknowledge them"", which has completely different meaning as the translation above.    3. 民可使，由之；不可使，知之 If people can be ruled, let them be. If they can't, enknowledge them.    4. 民可使，由之不可；使知之 If people can be ruled, one cannot just let them be. Guide them.   5. 民可使由之？不。可使知之 Can the people be left alone? No. They need to be guided.   "

This can involve radical decisions like the deleting or moving of entire lines and sections. The result is that most versions of the text you can actually pick up from a bookstore give the false impression that the text is complete and coherent, when in fact it's anything but. There's a very good in-depth discussion of the problem in the particular case of S.B. Griffith's 1963 translation of the *Sun Zi* in D.C. Lau's 'Some notes on the ""Sun Tzu""', *Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies* 28.2 (1965), especially pp. 325-329."

At least a few Dermatologic studies were published after the war and I was able to find a few of them, both of which focus on Acne in the Pacific Theater. While prior to the war acne was considered a nuisance more than something serious, American servicemen in the Pacific were found to be developing what came to be called ""tropical acne"", an extreme manifestation of the condition that could be physically debilitating and symptoms of which included ""large pustules, draining sinuses and extensive, disfiguring scars,frequently [keloidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid)"". To be sure, it isn't that the breakouts themselves were being caused by the men simply being in the Pacific - the studies indicate that a history of acne previous to service was a major factor - but various factors from the wartime environment, including ""increase in vasomotor activity, caused by the heat, plus the inadequate toilet facilities"" all contributed to severely affect men who had been sent to the Pacific. Being unable to clean, minor outbreaks could become infected, and many cases seem to have been serious enough that that the afflicted men were unable to continue serving on the front and had to be evacuated for more medical treatment, and many declared permanently unfit for duty.  Not all men who suffered breakouts were necessarily suffering from such acute symptoms though, and all in all, acne seems to have been one of the more common issues soldiers in the Pacific theater faced. As far as dermatological issues, at least, it was second only to tropical skin disease/fungal infections, with somewhere between 20 to 30 percent of all patients hospitalized for skin issues suffering from tropical acne.  As far as treatment goes, doctors found that standard treatments were generally quite ineffective and remaining in tropical conditions would generally cause a worsening. Attempts to use penicillin showed little real result while evacuation to cooler environments alone could cause real improvement in the condition, so that seems to have been the standard procedure.  So in short, someone else can weigh in on other theaters, but at least in the Pacific, Acne was a serious issue faced.  Edit: I was able to find one other source, which doesn't add to much to what has been said here beyond the [small addition here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/69dal7/was_painful_acne_ever_an_issue_in_ww2_if_i_slept/dh63f6r/) but does note that as far as the European theater goes ""[acne] was a condition of no consequence"".

72357	0	a	"I may actually have a relevant answer to this! For full disclosure, I'm not a historian and this is my first response to an AskHistorians thread, so if I mess anything up I hope my post is justly smote.  If I'm allowed to rephrase your question a bit to give it a broader context, it seems that what you're asking, more generally, is: **did soldiers in WWII, in the course of being soldiers, find themselves in conditions that led to painful blemishes or skin irritations?**  While this might not specifically mean acne as you're imagining it, the answer is, undoubtedly, yes! My grandfather, now deceased, served in the 6th Emergency Rescue Squadron, one of [seven squadrons of the USAAF](http://3rders.com/3rdERShist.htm) (the United States' air division before the creation of the USAF in 1947) designed for autonomous rescue during WWII. [Here's some brief verification of him to validate the source.](http://i.imgur.com/SRp2sg8.jpg) In looking at your question, I recalled a story he once told of a soldier laying on his stomach on a bed who was receiving injections to treat a pilonidal cyst, to which my grandfather asked ""what's that?"" and the soldier responded, ""it's a thing on your butt!"" Unfortunately, without any sort of documentation of this treatment or exchange, it's purely anecdotal for the purposes of your question.  However, I can do better!  As it turns out, in researching more specifics on what pilonidal cysts are, I discovered that it was actually such a common occurrence during World War II that it had a name: **Jeep Riders' Disease** (or just Jeep Disease).   So before we get ahead of ourselves, what exactly is pilonidal disease? According to the [American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons](https://www.fascrs.org/patients/disease-condition/pilonidal-disease), pilonidal disease is a skin infection in the crease of the buttocks, close to the coccyx, which can become an inflamed, painful cyst and may also become infected. I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to see how this could be bad for soldiers - discomfort and pain while moving or sitting would be present, and the treatment, which would likely involve [phenol injections](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/192668-treatment?pa=FOK0p2BPH2xBy%2BPOS8DkPqlB0jg7Xdz8WxSQfLU%2BhMB3vecAyiYCl8NXlVpBhcdpLYSTPqBPITs28e%2FfjVymGRgdh0IYUyErgfy%2FYxjHzUE%3D#d9) or lancing and drainage, could leave victims bedridden for days. There's also considerations for the potential for infection and sepsis - soldiers are going to be moving through dirty, hot environments that are going to aggravate their condition by sweating and the inability to bathe regularly. Though the initial question seems to be one of beauty, I think it's imperative to consider the implications of skin conditions that won't just be unsightly, but taking soldiers away from active duty.   Which brings us to the question of prevalence. Was this common? Most articles I've found, such as [this one](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039610909001248) seem to lead back to the same place: A February, 1944 article published in the Southern Medical Journal called [Jeep Disease: Pilonidal Disease of Mechanized Warfare](https://sma.org/southern-medical-journal/article/jeep-disease-pilonidal-disease-of-mechanized-warfare/). Although I can't personally access the article, other articles citing it make the claim that about about 80,000 soldiers during WWII were hospitalized for pilonidal disease due to long and frequently-rough jeep rides which put pressure and irritation on the coccyx of soldiers, hence the name Jeep Riders' Disease. Indeed, a [study that occurred from 2005 to 2011](https://tinyurl.com/lo2gf89) found that, even today, pilonidal disease retains a significant association with military personnel. Even though my grandfather's story will never be the primary source that I wish it were, it seems like he may not have been too far off the mark about this condition affecting soldiers during WWII.  So, to get back to your original question: Was acne ever an issue in WWII? To the degree we're talking about facial blemishes or irritating marks, I can't speak. But if we ask more broadly about the kinds of conditions that soldiers worked and fought in, could we say that they contributed to health issues, especially of the skin, which could impact service? Definitely. In the case I've described here, perhaps the soldiers have a great complexion, but it's what you *don't see* that's the real problem. While I find the question of whether acne as you imagine it would be common a good one, I think there's definitely enough information to say that there were skin problems in World War II, caused by the conditions soldiers were in, that were not only unusual or annoying, but downright painful and dangerous."
72358	0	a	"Short answer: Yes, it was an issue.  Long answer: Acne, and skin disease in general, were evaluated in new recruits and draftees when they first reported for service. However, there was no official policy on whether to accept or reject someone based on their skin disease(s). Many doctors, especially early in the war, leaned towards accepting those with diseases. This accepting policy would prove to be somewhat of a mistake, because it became apparent that these admitted men were a large burden on Army dispensaries and hospital facilities. This burden was amplified when deployed into Tropical areas of combat, further reducing the combat effectiveness of the afflicted soldiers.  Acne in and of itself was not used as justification to turn people away however. Of 20,000 candidates for induction at U.S. Army Recruiting and Induction Station, Tacoma, Washington, 248 had acne vulgaris, and 0 were rejected.  Going back to the Tropics, acne (and other skin diseases caused by the tropical environment) was a significant issue.   From a survey at Fitzsimons General Hospital:  >""A typical history revealed that the patient had had some trouble with blackheads and acneiform lesions when he was 15 to 18 years of age, but none since, including his period of training in the Zone of Interior. Trouble began, however, some 6 months after his arrival in the Southwest Pacific Area or some other tropical area. The first manifestation was the development of large, tender, inflammatory cystic lesions on the shoulder and back, which made it impossible to carry a pack. After he was treated for a considerable time by the battalion surgeon, sometimes in a forward hospital and occasionally in a general hospital, the patient was evacuated to the Zone of Interior.""  The severe acne developed by men in the Southwest Pacific Area and India-China-Burma theater was very painful and risked life-threatening infections should a lesion burst and be exposed. the best course of action became immediately sending the men to the Zone of Interior (i.e. back to the U.S.) when they developed acne too severe to be combat effective, as military hospitals were not equipped to deal with it.

72365	0	a	Most universities have some sort of portal site that allows you to search *all* journal sites out there, such as JSTOR, MUSE, etc. in one single go. It is an amazingly useful tool to have, as I was able to turn up both these articles through JAMA Network, which provides access to a number of medical journals. It is basically a matter of having access to the right tools, knowing the 'search' tricks to get what you want and avoid the fluff, and a little luck. These were really the *only* things I found (I'm still trying though, as I'd love to add on about the ETO), so there might not be all that much more to even be had.   Also cc /u/c0ldfuse who asked the same thing.
72366	0	a	Unfortunately the sources I found were both from a medical journal, so very specifically focused on the outbreaks and treatment within the US forces in the region.
72367	0	a	Not specifically, but it does note that those with severe cases of tropical acne were not redeployed to tropical areas, so this would seem to *imply* that you didn't gain some sort of 'immunity' by having had it once. Much of the susceptibility seems to be based on preexisiting factors, so redeploying into the same conditions would likely aggravate it again. Again, it doesn't spell it out in quite so explicit terms, but that does seem to be implied.
72368	0	a	[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) is another awesome way to find sources. It will search through scholarly journals just like OP mentioned of University portals. Depending on whether the journal is available online, it may give you a link to the full article or else a source that you would have to then go pay for or go find in a library somewhere. If you are hooked up to a University Network (like using campus Wifi), you can usually gain access to their paid online journal subscriptions thereby increasing the amount of articles you can read for free online.

72371	0	a	You can set up Google Scholar to do that too. Go to https://scholar.google.com   Click on Settings at the top. On the left hand side, click on Library Links. Enter your school into the search box and click search. Check the box for your school (also make sure it's checked for Open WorldCat). Click save.   Now when you search, you'll see a link to the right of articles you'd be able to access via your school. If you're off-campus, you'll be prompted to sign-in after clicking the link to the right of the article title.   I like going it this way because it often brings up more than I would normally get through just my school's search engine. If it's something I need really bad that my school doesn't get, I can ask a co-author for it, or go to the page of one of the authors, since many people are now linking their articles through their online cvs.  
72372	0	a	"You can listen to the BBC Radio 3 discussion where McKellen publically came out [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12012.shtml), in conversation with the (very conservative) editor of the *Telegraph*, Peregrine Worsthorne. The first discussion of McKellen's coming out I can find is [a profile of McKellen in the British newspaper *The Independent* from February 20th, 1988](http://www.mckellen.com/writings/activism/880220independent.htm), which is preserved on Ian McKellen's webpage as his writing (which it clearly is not). McKellen's coming out is portrayed as political activism in opposition to 'Clause 28', mooted legislation forbidding local governments to promote the idea that homosexual relationships might be normal. McKellen became involved in activism against Clause 28 in early January. Maybe one could say that the future Gandalf was trying to tell parliamentarians: you shall not pass...this bill. (Despite McKellen's activism, it became law in May)  According to the summary of McKellen's activism about Clause 28 in the *Independent* article:  >On Sunday, 24 January, he walked on stage and on to television screens at the Laurence Olivier Awards. ""The greatest surprise"", says one of the invited audience, ""was the roar of approval that greeted him when he mentioned Clause 28"". The next day he shepherded a host of stars, and one baby, on stage at the Playhouse, before journalists and Lords bussed down the Embankment for the occasion. The radio and television blitz followed, and by the end of the week homosexuality and censorship were issues of national interest in a way unknown since the late Sixties.    >To achieve this, McKellen played a very private card. One friend describes it: ""Coming out is the essence of gay liberation, and Ian understands that. There are only two or three other working actors who have done it, because it is dangerous. But he knew it was time to stand up and be counted."" Though he described himself as gay in a World Service programme on 19 January, the declaration was made to most of Britain on Radio 3's Third Ear, on 27 January.  >The occasion was a spirited argument with Peregrine Worsthorne. It provoked a remark about ""disgusting homosexual practices"" from the editor of the Sunday Telegraph, and a query laden with innocence from McKellen: did Mr Worsthorne mean the Garrick when he spoke about gay clubs? The following Sunday's leader did the Stop Clause 28 campaign no harm at all.  Unfortunately, the archives of the London *Telegraph* do not appear to go back more than 20 years, and Peregrine Worsthorne's response to McKellen's coming out in his paper is not accessible online as far as I can tell.  Additionally, McKellen wrote a piece for [*Capital Gay* magazine summarising his rather eventful 1988](http://www.mckellen.com/activism/activism_coming_out.htm). In it, he essentially claims that his homosexuality was not particularly a surprise to anyone in his life, given the theatrical circles he moved in:  >That I had actually come out probably surprised me more than my being gay can have shocked any listener who knew my work. Indeed, some of them have written to say that they'd known I was gay for years and couldn't care less. When I told my step-mother, soon after, she said the same. My friends had always known; so had my fellow actors, because backstage there are few secrets. But I'd always avoided saying I was gay to the media - even to the gay press - insisting that my private life was my own. My complacency had involved nothing more embarrassing than the occasional white lie about not being married - I was never, though, one to talk about looking for the right girl and relishing parenthood.  In terms of reaction in the US, the first mention I can find on Factiva is a reference in the *Boston Globe* to McKellen, in April 1988, winning the Norton Award for the best achievements in Boston-area theatre, for his one-man show, 'Ian McKellen Acting Shakespeare'. Giving a speech, accepting the award, according to a *Boston Globe* story by Jeff McLaughlin:  >With regard to the denouement of McKellen's remarks -- in which he recounted his decision to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality and work for tolerance and rights for gay people in Britain -- not even Elliot Norton knew what was coming. Norton said, in a Wednesday note, that McKellen had asked for at least 20 minutes to speak, but did not discuss his topic beforehand. ""But he had planned it,"" Norton wrote, ""to the point of writing out his whole talk and, in the half hour or so before the ceremony, studying part of it before a dressing-room mirror.""  >McKellen's speech may well approach historic status, and it certainly will become part of Boston theater folklore, since no one had thought ahead of time to set up a tape recorder.  One journalist's reference to McKellen from the point of view of someone not particularly inclined towards progressive views came from a review of the TV documentary Open Space on BBC2; Martin Cropper in *The Times* said of *Open Space* that:  >Open Space (BBC2) illustrated the condition [of homosexuality] with some predictable examples: the 'spanking judge', for instance, who resigned his recordership after exposure in the tabloids; the 'out' lesbian who enlisted in the Wrens specifically to meet like-minded adults, without realizing that the armed forces are the only sphere where such activity has ever been illegal. The most intelligent comment was Ian McKellen's plea for respectable homosexuals to help erode prejudice by declaring themselves publically - a move which would, however, posit a different society.  >As one has come to expect from access-television, the historical perspective was on the flimsy side. In this country at least, the 'homophobic' backlash started years before Aids had been heard of, for the obvious reason that some 'straights' had had it to here with the hectoring aggression of homosexual propaganda.  Another reference to Ian McKellen discussing his homosexuality comes from an article in the *Sunday Times* about the filming of a ITV Phil Donahue special (i.e., with the American talk show host filming a British version of the show):   >On Wednesday the subject was clause 28. On the panel were two straights, Sir Rhodes Boyson and the Rev David Rushworth-Smith, and two gay actors, Ian McKellen and Michael Cashman, who plays Colin in EastEnders. Noisy claques in the audience booed Boyson and the vicar, and cheered the actors.  >Donahue had been told that the reserved British would never speak out; luckily many present were Americans who can utter words like ``sexuality'' without a blush.  >The debate goes like this. A fat woman is horrified to be surrounded by these homosexuals; a pigtailed young man says he's heterosexual but live and let live; a lesbian mother with two teenage children is rounded on by a man in favour of ""the normal family unit''; Donahue asks who is to say what is normal? And so on. When Boyson says, ""God created man and woman'' and McKellen rejoins, ""and together they created a homosexual'' such a sequitur is rare.  >A grey-haired English woman declares with dignity, ""I am the mother of a gay son'', but we hear no more from her: it is time for a commercial break. After it, Donahue has found another old lady. She says: ""People who are born like that, it's like being a cripple isn't it? I mean they can't help it] Well, it's sad they're born, isn't it?''  >Nobody in the audience knows whether to laugh or cry.  Ian McKellen was not the first theatre actor to come out as gay, as Simon Callow had come out in a book he wrote in 1984. In early June 1988, Callow mentions McKellen in a Diary piece written in *The Times*:  >The latest such event has been inspired by that fumbling piece of legislation, Clause 28 of the Local Government Bill. To raise money for the possible victims of the clause, an extraordinary group of artists Simon Rattle, Dame Judi Dench, Mike Gambon and many others across the spectrum of the performing arts are appearing at the Piccadilly theatre this Sunday. The event has been largely inspired and organized by Ian McKellen. It was his cheeky notion to call the show Promoting Homosexuality (echoing the ambiguous phrasing of the clause itself) but the intention behind the show is not polemical; it simply represents the anxiety of a large number of performers about a piece of law that affects us all.  Elsewhere, most of the references to Ian McKellen in Factiva from 1988 refer to his career continuing as per usual, which makes me suspect that nobody into theatre in England (or Boston) in the 1980s was enormously surprised, or cared particularly that a leading actor was gay; he starred as (the heterosexual) Profumo in the 1989 film *Scandal*. Ultimately, McKellen was knighted by the Queen in 1991; coming out in 1988 didn't stop him from symbolically being admitted to the establishment.  Nonetheless, anti-homosexual prejudice in the wake of the AIDS epidemic had a support base within the Conservative Party, not least with Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, who in a 1987 conference speech said that ""Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay...all of those children are being cheated of a sound start in life. Yes, cheated!"" Clause 28 remained on the books until the Labor government voted it out in March 2003.   McKellen relates in the *Capital Gay* piece discussed Clause 28 with Tories at Westminister:   >At Westminster, I met our lawmakers — and remembered their words: The Minister — ""I don't understand why young homosexuals need their own clubs — why can't they mix with everybody else of their own age?""  The Whip in the Commons — ""I'm sorry about Section 28 — it's just a bit of red meat thrown to our right-wing wolves.""  The Whip in the Lords — ""I'm sorry about Section 28 — but you appreciate my job is just to get our chaps to vote the right way.""   "

However, [edit to reflect /u/sacredsnowhawk's point, below], female homosexual activity did not receive anywhere near the same legislative fervor as male homosexual activity. Cropper's comment, therefore, is best read as saying that ""the armed forces are the only sphere where [lesbian] activity has ever been illegal""; [it was only in 2000 that the ban on lesbians and gays serving in the military was lifted](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/nov/19/bensummerskill.theobserver). As a result, a lesbian going into the British military before 2000 was in danger of being kicked out if they met someone of the same sex there and were discovered."

72379	0	a	> Clarifying, as Zuckerberg later did, that Facebook would remove posts for “advocating violence” will never be effective for a simple reason. Any attempt to make Nazism palatable again is a call for violence.   What's more, removing only the pro-nazi posts which are explicit calls to violence assists them on making Nazism more palatable. That is effectively acting as editors, removing content that might repel an otherwise susceptible reader.

I took a decision recently to start taking a very heavy handed approach in dealing with these toxic users.

My colleague /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov once said that if someone payed me to sit around 24/7 to do nothing but refute Holocaust deniers, we could consider allowing it on here but as long as that isn't the case, the danger of providing them a platform (which they would have still have with the above hypothetical because not everybody reads long and in-depth refutations but will read short and punchy questions and false statements).

72398	0	a	"Like my colleague said, *if* we could count on public destruction for all to see, it is something we would honestly consider. There is absolutely value in watching Deniers get demolished at every point they try to make. But how can we guarantee that? One of the things deniers are banking on is that the historians *don't* have the time to respond to every question, and some remain there unanswered so they can go ""SEEE!!!???"" They are banking that historians don't have the patience to keep countering every single point they bring up, which has been debunked again and again, but they keep hammering on, so that they can win simply by being the last one standing not because they made a single valid point, and go ""SEEEEEE???!!"" That is, in the end, all that they are actually hoping to achieve, and so giving them a platform online, in all but the rarest exceptions, pretty much ensures they will break through and attain their goal. The most workable way to counter them is to not engage deniers, but ensure that you *do* engage with those asking in good faith, and do your utmost to educate."

I'd say Holocaust denial questions are pretty much either trolling or lazy and they are never helpful. I think allowing it just gives it more visibility. There are very few people who actually believe in that garbage who are willing to be persuaded by rational evidence. "
72400	0	a	"> inaccurate ideas can be destroyed publicly   In a world full of rational, informed people, that would work.  In the real world, it does not.  Denialists cannot be swayed with facts and debate.  They've already chosen to be actively wrong, and no amount of evidence is going to dissuade them.    But that's not even the real problem with allowing debate.  The real problem is everybody else.  Someone with no real understanding of the topic and poor critical thinking skills sees this ""debate"", and concludes that the existence of the holocaust must still be an open question.  You can pile up mountains of conclusive evidence on one side, and compare it to a handful of demonstrably-false and logically-inconsistent rubbish on the other, and the average idiot *can't tell the difference.*  To them, it appears that ""both sides must have a point"".  The world in general (and the US in particular) is not in a position where you can simply present facts to a layperson and expect them to come to the obviously-correct conclusion.    Simply allowing a debate on issues that have long since been conclusively proved negates the conclusion.  As long as you allow that there *are* two sides, then half the people will pick the obviously-wrong side out of ignorance or deliberate contrarianism.    There *are not* two sides to this issue.  Nazi Germany *did* systematically kill many millions of people based on their race, religion, and sexual orientation.  There is nothing to gain by entertaining debate over this fact, because it is a *fact*."

How can it be that one of the richest companies in the world atm is able to police f.ex. Sandy Hook conspiracy content but not Holocaust denial?  Edit: And how does the argument that it is impractical negate the argument that if Facebook wants to have greater responsibilty regarding fighting hatred – as they have stated – they need to remove holocaust denial?"
72404	0	a	I do not agree with you that it is naive to assume that quality moderation can be provided on Facebook.   [Recent reports indicate](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/undercover-report-shows-the-facebook-moderation-sausage-being-made/) that Facebook has a significant moderation team that is simply overtaxed. They have plans to add more members to that team, and should be doing so more quickly considering the amount of resources the company has.   In addition, it appears that Facebook’s own policies are standing in the way of good moderation. Things (such as holocaust denial, according to Zuckerberg) are not being taken down because that is Facebook’s policy.   It is crazy that Facebook—one of the most well-resources companies in the world, with one of the richest CEOs in the world—would not spend its resources in developing a competent moderation team and implementing policies to disallow things such as holocaust denial. They could do it, but they choose not to.   I personally believe that Facebook is making this choice in order to protect its social media hegemony. As soon as they start banning truly destructive ideas, the people who spread these destructive ideas will move elsewhere. That will hurt Facebook’s numbers and growth—which is the one thing they care about.   Because this is AskHistorians, I feel compelled to cite something. For those interested in the subject of how the arguments of holocaust deniers are so divorced from reality, I’d like to suggest reading  [The Case for Auschwitz](http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=20045) by Robert Jan Van Pelt. Van Pelt is an architectural historian who was a key witness in the libel case that David Irving brought against Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt. This book is essentially the expert report he prepared for the trial, expanded in to a very large book.   In it, Van Pelt lays out the exact argument that people like Irving use to engage in holocaust denial, and then spends the rest of the book utterly demolishing it piece by piece. It is a fascinating book not only due to its meticulous research, but also to learn the arguments of holocaust deniers. The book is brilliantly argued, with reproductions of key documents, and shows how flawed, detached from reality, and willfully blind of the facts holocaust deniers are.
72405	0	a	> While the premise of this article is pretty naive  You missed the premise of the article then. The point of the article was to refute the claim that Holocaust deniers are simply getting their facts mixed up, and that Holocause denial in itself is a call to violence.  There’s a wide gulf between not being able to effectively implement a policy on Facebook, and *refusing to address the issue at all*.
72406	0	a	I have a question, however regarding this line.  > The intentions behind those posts don’t matter. To gauge whether a person is malicious or merely “ironic” is a futile exercise, for to give Holocaust deniers’ positions a platform is to disseminate their propaganda.  For example somebody coming from an Asian or African country genuinely has questions regarding the pseudo-points thrown out by the Deniers as you mentioned in the article. How would you deal with them? Will you send them like a PM giving them links and then remove their question? Or they just going to be casualties and be banned. IMHO that would be counter-productive and help in pushing them towards the other side. Because you know in places like India, Pakistan,etc there is a lot of admiration for a person like Hitler. Reason is not they are anti-Semitic, but more along the line that he could stuff done and made Germany get back on its feet. It doesnt help that the British ruled the subcontinent, bought it to its knees, and when the war was going starved millions of Indians to death. Enemy of my enemy kind of thing.   Reason I say this as an astrophysicist I am asked multiple times about moon landing by some curious people who genuinely have no agenda, I take my time out to explain how ludicrous that conspiracy is. After that, I try to send people to Wikipedia since they are pretty decent. I feel if I dont give them the time they might start believing in the conspiracy theory.   Finally I would like to say, I love this subreddit, i recommend it lots of people. You people do a great job in moderating and keeping the quality up. & I know the question I asked is a very tricky one. It would be great to hear from your side.

Giving “revisionists” a platform to share their views will enable them to recruit those who can’t figure out the holes in the supposed logic of the revisionist history. 
72409	0	a	This should go without saying, but I am not defending holocaust denial.  Clearly, Facebook should enforce hate speech associated with such ridiculous concepts.  But I also recognize that Facebook will always have a different line of moderation than ask historians, because Facebook fundamentally serves a different purpose.  Most communications on Facebook are either private conversations or conversations between small groups of people.  We all must recognize that moderation in that type of environment is inherently much more numerous, much more touchy, and much more personal than a highly controlled news site like ask historians.  Short of turning Facebook into something it isn’t, there’s just no way to tightly moderate the views of individuals talking to other individuals, in most cases.  Zuckerberg trapped himself by calling out such a ridiculous concept of holocaust denial, but he does have a point that at some level Facebook has to let some controversial opinions pass.  The vast majority of those opinions clearly would not meet ask historians quality standards.  It’s just the nature of the monster that he’s created and so many people have flocked to.  It sucks.  I really dislike Facebook personally.  But that’s what Facebook is.  In many cases, reddit is not so different.  That’s what makes this sub so special.  It shows an alternative to a mob-rule social media experience.

72413	0	a	The Dunning-Kruger effect is a hell of a drug.  More specifically, people who are (legitimately!) experts in one thing or another are often used to being the smartest person in the room and can throw a few gears when there are other people present saying things at variance with their own stances, even if the topic's something wholly outside of their areas of specialty.  (In universities this can often be an issue with people taking their first senior undergraduate seminars, or brand-new graduate students. I was very lucky and got the attitude burned off as an undergrad, but the first month or so of my MA was *painful* until about half the cohort got their egoes sanded down to a smoother surface.)

72415	0	a	Holocaust denial has been debunked 1000 times over. Anyone can find literally hundreds of resources doing so, including a whole lot of the content in our sub (which includes also debunkings of many of the most popular claims because people have asked in good faith how they are wrong). The thing is that Holocaust deniers don't care about refutation. Their aim is to sow doubt among the audience – with curious skeptics especially susceptible – in order to further radicalize them into rehabilitating Nazism. It's not about discussion, it's about audience.  
72416	0	a	"Holocaust deniers are easily refuted.  The problem is that they have already decided that they will not accept refutation, and will continue to spout demonstrably-false talking points.    The further problem is that the uninformed and unintelligent cannot differentiate between a flawed, false argument and an accurate, factually-correct one.  They just see ""a debate"" and conclude that it must still be an open question.  The veracity of the holocaust is *not* an open question.  Nazi Germany absolutely did systematically kill more than ten million people based on their nationality, religion, race, and/or sexual orientation.  This fact is incontrovertible and not up for debate.  Merely entertaining debate at this stage allows bigots to sow doubt and confusion where none need exist."
72417	0	a	The issue isn’t that the body of evidence is too weak, on the contrary it’s overwhelmingly accepted to have happened, the issue is that some parties refuse to accept reality that isn’t part of their worldview. They don’t engage in debate, they’re just fishing for other people who hold the same viewpoint that they do who are either fully on their side or are teetering on the fence. Social science shows that having groups of people who hold the same views together further reinforces those views and in some cases radicalizes them.    In summary, they’re not presenting a debate with actual evidence and willingness to engage in discussion with people who hold opposite viewpoints, they’re enlisting on an open platform for whatever viewpoint they have. 
72418	0	a	From the *Slate* article:   > It takes them little effort to formulate a wrong assertion, but it takes historians a long time and a lot of words to refute one. Our early attempts to engage on these points have shown that length and nuance do not play well on the internet and do not interest the deniers. The point of JAQing off is not to debate facts. It’s to have an audience hear denialist lies in the first place.

It's sort of the opposite of a Gish Gallop.
72427	0	a	>Yeah, that is an assumption, and as far as I've seen so far, it's not backed by any sources. There are some Holocaust deniers out there who won't be convinced of anything, true.

A lot of people ended up there because of conspiracy theories, what's needed is refutation  of those theories.  It's backed by simple logic. People on the fence are totally ignorant of history. Giving a platform to lies does not help their understanding of history. There are no Nazis who are open minded. Nazism and open mindedness are mutually exclusive. If conspiracy theorists were interested in facts or logic they would not be conspiracy theorists.
72428	0	a	"The Warren Commission formed after the assassination of President Kennedy produced [this appendix](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html) on the history of presidential protection. They note that before Lincoln, ""there was remarkably little concern about the safety of Presidents and few measures were taken to protect them."" This persisted even after President Jackson survived an assassination attempt due to a misfiring gun. In the 1840s Congress did assign a guard to the White House — but apparently with more of an aim to protecting the building and grounds than its primary occupant.   During the Civil War Lincoln was guarded irregularly — sometimes by Washington, D.C. policemen, and sometimes by Army units. Lincoln ""was reluctant to surround himself with guards and often rejected protection or sought to slip away from it."" This, the report notes, ""has been characteristic of almost all American Presidents.""  The congressional report after Lincoln's assassination, ""with traditional reluctance, called for no action to provide better protection for the President in the future."" The Warren Commission notes that some people at the time saw Lincoln's assassination as a unique reflection of the Civil War, which was now over, and not something indicative of a need for broader protections. Indeed, for more than a decade after Booth, presidents continued to walk about in public alone and unguarded. (I remember, but cannot find a source, an anecdote about either Grant or Hayes, that upon receiving a threat on his life, the president didn't change his routine other than to purchase a heavier walking stick. Sadly, you should disregard this anecdote unless someone else can find a source for it, but it's delightful enough I thought I'd mention it as an aside.)  After President Garfield was shot, the New York Tribune contrasted ""the simple Republican manner of life which the custom of nearly a century has prescribed for the Chief Magistrate of the United States"" with ""the forms and safeguards of courts"" — implying that bodyguards were seen as a courtly, monarchical affectation, where as a republican president should be open and accessible to the people (July 3, 1881, quoted in Warren Commission report). Surprisingly or not, despite the second assassination of a president in two decades, Congress ""took no steps to provide the President with personal protection.""  The Secret Service, initially a group for combatting counterfeiters and financial crimes, first began providing part-time presidential protection in 1894 — apparently a coincidence because a group of Colorado gamblers were suspected of plotting to assassinate President Cleveland. President McKinley actually had Secret Service protection when he was assassinated, but it was his death that finally spurred Congress to give the Secret Service ""full-time responsibility for the safety of the President.""  Returning to Lincoln, he was certainly aware that many people wanted to kill him. President Theodore Roosevelt later quoted Lincoln saying, ""Though it would be safer for a president to live in a cage, it would interfere with his business."" He had sporadic guards but no formal protection.  Fascinatingly, General Ulysses Grant was originally invited to attend Ford's Theater with Lincoln on that fatal night. He begged off with an excuse about needing to be with his children, but [possibly because Julia Grant and Mary Todd Lincoln hated each other](https://featherfoster.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/mary-lincolns-rivals/).   From a [recent biographical article on Grant](https://www.damninteresting.com/the-reconstruction-of-ulysses-s-grant/):  > Grant would never forgive himself for begging off, certain that had he accepted the invitation, his bodyguards stationed outside the door would have stopped Booth. **As lieutenant general of the U.S. Army he was entitled to armed protection around the clock. The president in those days was not.**  Hopefully this was helpful!"
72429	0	a	Fantastic answer, thanks! The bit about bodyguards being seen as an affectation for for monarchs is just the kind of detail I was hoping to hear, because from everything I've ever read, European and Asian monarchs had extensive bodyguards going well back into the the Renaissance (and likely further), so it's not like the idea that the ruler of a nation at war needed protection from assassination was a new idea!  Also, it's very interesting to me that Grant would have had 24 hour security, but Lincoln didn't. I wonder if that's indicative of a divide people had back then between the propriety of targeting a civilian versus a military leader?
72430	0	a	"After further research, I will add as an aside that while monarchs in Europe definitely had guards around this time, the move in the U.S. toward greater protection of its leaders over the second half of the 19th Century was a worldwide trend, even among those who already had guards.  This time period saw the rise of anarchist movements and other dissidents, some of whom believed in the concept of [""propaganda of the deed""](http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws55_prop_deed.html) — the idea that an assassination of a (definitionally illegitimate and oppressive) leader would do far more to bring support to your cause than merely publishing a pamphlet. McKinley's assassin was an anarchist, but worldwide a number of heads of state, including Emperor Napoleon III and several Russian tsars, faced assassination attempts in this period — some successful.  From the book ""[Royal Murders: Hatred, Revenge and the Seizing of Power](https://books.google.com/books?id=q50TDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT172&lpg=PT172&dq=queen+victoria's+bodyguards&source=bl&ots=O_pEbS0D2L&sig=K3MvwMV4IxqiWmbwBA3wgKUPSAg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxm_eGuaTTAhUCw4MKHYKhAf0Q6AEIlwEwGA#v=onepage&q=queen%20victoria's%20bodyguards&f=false)"":   > The years 1898-1914 were the heyday of the anarchist assassin... By the last decade of the nineteenth century, the monarchs of Europe were closely guarded. The attempts on the lives of three of them in 1878 and the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 had reinforced the conviction that there must be a huge investment of men, money and effort in protecting 'crowned heads'.   It was in these years that Scotland Yard created its Special Branch"" to ""undertake surveillance of those suspected of subversive activities *and also to act as bodyguards to members of the British royal family and of foreign royal families visiting Britain*"" (emphasis added).   The first two presidential assassinations *could* be dismissed, if people were so inclined, as one-off events — one tied to the now-past turmoil of the Civil War and the other mentally unstable.

In Greek and Roman authors, who were much more commonly known in those days, a public official's seeking a bodyguard was a clear sign that they aimed at making themselves tyrant, and everyone at the time would have immediately recognized the parallel. When the above poster quotes the New York Tribune as praising his ""republican"" way of life, this is one of the things they meant: ""republican"" partly in the Roman sense of being an accountable servant of the laws and the state, as opposed to acting tyrannically."

So is it sensible to assume that presidents refused guards as a way of saying ""even though I maybe in danger, I am a servant of the people and I need to move freely amongst them""?  The president today will go to those very well planned events that make it look like he's amongst the people, or they'll have events at the White House... but fundamentally, it's very much interaction at arms length from what I can see.  Like, cool, the president is eating breakfast at a diner... but everything has been planned and vetted.  In the past, were they more casual with such things? Like, did they actively try and make it seem as though they're a public servant / ""commoner""?"
72434	0	a	"While I certainly hope you were being glib with your Oliver Stone comment, the short answer to your question is: ""Not much."" There certainly was no information that changed the official narrative of the assassination; though there were a lot of intriguing new bits of information about the case, and semi-unrelated cases.  The Washington Post did an absolutely terrific breakdown of the most notable revelations here:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/jfk-assassination-files/?utm_term=.2937d722401c  Probably the most notable, at least from my perspective, were documents detailing some of the various CIA plans and plots to kill Castro. This, of course, has long been known, but this particular document (the first one listed in the Washington Post piece) is an official 1975 internal examination of all the efforts and fleshes out the various plots in much greater detail than was ever known before.  The 82 page memo refers to another, unpublished 1967 memo by J. Edgar Hoover with the absolutely wonderfully title of ""Central Intelligence Agency's Intentions to Send Hoodlums to Cuba to Assassinate Castro."" This, of course, speaks to the intra-agency conflicts between the FBI and the CIA on matters related to Cuba.  But your question is ""is there anything in these files that provides any type of indication of a conspiracy in the JFK assasination?"" and the answer is, ""No."" The whole release dominated the news cycle for what, about a day? The level of revelations--dominated by interesting but not particularly revelatory minutiae--seems to indicate that this was about the appropriate level of general interest.  Keep in mind that at the very last moment, Donald Trump elected to withhold numerous documents for further vetting. So until those specific documents are released, we are looking at a subset of all of the information still contained in the archives."
72435	0	a	I have a related question, given a large information dump like the JFK investigation, how do historians analyze the information these days?
72436	0	a	There's no standard way to do it. Typically we download everything and read it over. If you are really serious about the research, you try to categorize it one way or another so that it becomes more usable. There are many different ways to do this, ranging from the very high-tech to the very low-tech, and the differences will depend on the historian, their goals, sometimes their methods (some historians are into computational analysis of texts, but most are not). Some involve hiring undergraduates to do the most boring and mindless work for you. :-)

His uncle, Keffe D, said as much in an [interview with police] (http://www.laweekly.com/news/the-keffe-d-tapes-10-highlights-of-confession-from-gangster-who-says-sean-combs-hired-him-to-kill-tupac-2395421).   According to [LAbyrinth](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CQlPvwmA4l8C&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&gl=US&gclid=CIHH7bbN_c4CFaRrMgodizYE_g&gclsrc=ds), Anderson was allegedly a member of the South Side Crips who had had issues with Suge Knight's Bloods-affiliated record label dating back to an incident at an LA mall in which Death Row associate Travon Lane had his DR medallion stolen in a Footlocker. Speculation claims that Puffy paid for this, as he wanted to use the chain in a Bad Boy video mocking DR, but if there's evidence that it was more than speculation, I've never seen it.   Additionally, it's fairly well documented that in the weeks following 2Pac's death there was a large scale gang war in LA, seeking retaliation for his death. MC Eiht, a longtime Compton rapper, has [gone on record] (http://www.ballerstatus.com/2016/02/03/mc-eiht-says-tupacs-gang-affiliations-led-to-his-death/) stating he believes it was 2Pac's gang affiliation (through Suge Knight) that led to his murder.   If you comb through his Death Row releases, they're full of references to Bloods, down to his repeated use of ""M.O.B.,"" a common Blood saying (Suge is also a known member of the Mob Pirus) and shout-outs to known Pirus ([Neckbone, Tray,Buntry](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-philipssuge15nov1502-story.html)).  That said, LAPD Detective Greg Kading wrote in his book [Murder Rap](https://www.amazon.com/Murder-Rap-Untold-Investigations-Detective/dp/0983955484) that he believes Puffy commissioned Keffe D for the hit. It is also alleged that Biggie [paid $1 million and provided the gun] (http://www.mtv.com/news/1457346/biggie-paid-gang-to-kill-tupac-report-says/) that took out his rival.   There is further speculation that 2Pac was planning on leaving Death Row, which led to Suge Knight to order his death, but remember Knight was in the car when 2Pac was shot.   At the end of the day, no one really knows. Everyone involved is either dead or not talking.    "

72446	0	a	Why do you assume that this was somehow orchestrated or instigated from New York taking advantage of inter-gang LA rivalries, rather than a build up of inter-gang LA rivalries plain and simple? Mysteries often get fixed onto famous people, even when there's no evidence for it. For example, there's a theory that Napoleon Bonaparte's cousin was the mother to an Ottoman sultan. The evidence for this is [Napolean's cousin disappeared (concievably kidnapped) on the Mediterreanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimée_du_Buc_de_Rivéry) and that, like many Ottoman Sultans, Sultan Murad II had [a mother of ambiguous, probably Christian, origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakşidil_Sultan) (she was likely Georgian and, therefore, there's almost certainly no actual connection between the women).   The Orlando Anderson as trigger man theory is pretty consistent, but what's the strongest evidence to suggest that the murde conspiracy goes beyond some LA gang members who were in Las Vegas that evening?
72447	0	a	Thanks for the info. What does M.O.B mean?
72448	0	a	I'll try to avoid speculation and state the basics. Few things:  1) East coast-West coast rivalry. For the past few years, rappers based in LA were heavily competing with those based in NYC. You had people like Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre and Ice Cube in the West feuding with people like Nas, Jay Z, P Diddy etc. It was a fairly high profile industry feud that was at the forefront of MTV. They openly mocked each other in public. Tupac was the representative for the West coast, and Biggie for the East coast. Tupac used to be from New York and actually used to open shows for Biggie, so there's a bit of a storylike element to it.  2) Gang involvement. The Bloods and Crips were involved in both Tupac and Biggie's lives. This is where a lot of speculation comes in so I'll avoid going into detail.  3) Time and place of murder. Tupac was shot on the Las Vegas strip coming out of a Mike Tyson fight. There were a lot of people around, and this made the unsolved status of the murder all the more confusing.  4) LA police corruption. One of the big issues in the 90s was police brutality and police corruption in LA. Again, gang involvement becomes relevant again and there's just more speculation.  5) There was an attempted murder on Tupac a year before his death. Theories immediately popped up, and Tupac directly blamed Biggie.  6) Tupac tried to leave Suge Knight and make his own record label, taking his music with him. Suge Knight was not happy about this.  7) Biggie was murdered in LA the year after his death, and his case was unsolved as well.  8) Both rapper frequently rapped and talked about death. They both believed they were fated to die early, Tupac often believed he would die as a martyr.  With all of this combined, you can see how it became a web of conspiracies very quickly, as it seemed like anyone and everyone surrounding them couldve been involved, and it was all like something out of a movie.
72449	0	a	"I feel like that allegation was just from Suge Knight boasting and joking after Eazy E's death, no real evidence or proof for it.  Eazy E was a known sex fiend and took pride in bedding multiple women per day and not wearing condoms.   I don't know how to time stamp on my phone, but if you go to the 31:30 point of [this documentary](https://youtu.be/Q7HoVypBqug) they discuss his daily point system for having sex with girls and how he used to tease his group members for being against him because he was a ""thrill seeker"" who didn't wear condoms. Good way to contract HIV without Suge's help."
72450	0	a	Nothing was proven but I can say that it's pretty outrageous to think Suge injected him with HIV. For one, it's really hard for HIV to survive outside of blood; so if it was just the virus on an acupuncture needle as the story goes, it's a really low chance he'd have caught it. If we assume that Suge stabbed him with a syringe of HIV blood, then we are also assuming Eazy knew what happened and who did it, and easily could have told people etc.   Realistically, Eazy was sexually active from the time he was 14 and a drug user. I don't think it's outlandish to think that it was his lifestyle that gave him HIV, not Suge.

History is often like a puzzle, and you have bits and pieces which you need to fit together. As noted in the linked thread, ""this rule shouldn't be taken as disallowing any and all speculation"", because inferring from the evidence is one of the tools in an historian's arsenal. But ""that dude is crazy"" is not evidence, or at least, not sufficient evidence to venture an answer on."

In particular, 1st Corinthians 15:3-8 was written in ~54 and already has the sound of a quoted dogma of the church, which would have needed to be written down significantly earlier to be widely known among Christians by 54.

72462	0	a	"The other common non-christian source cited is Tacitus, around 116 CE. He was discussing the early Christian origins with respect to their persecution under Nero. The claim that Josephus is the only ""non-Christian"" source depends on your time-frame. He's certainly one of the closest temporally to Jesus's lifetime. As you expand the range of time, place, and specificity, you can reasonably make the claim that there are dozens of roughly contemporary sources, ranging from Pliny the Younger, to Suetonius, and to pieces of the Talmud. Many of these sources don't directly attest to Jesus, merely Christians, or their object of worship, but taken together, there's a host of sources that can be used to narrow down some of the details of his life, such as Tacitus writing on his crucifixion.  However, this might all be missing the point a bit. Christian sources can be just as helpful when determining Jesus's historical existence. By far the easiest and most straightforward explanation for early Christian writing, and especially the biographical elements of the first three Gospels, is that Jesus existed and provided a basis for the oral tradition and eventual writings of early Christians. The fact that the sources also had a theological bent doesn't prevent us from drawing conclusions from them, and any argument that the only early sources that attest to Jesus are Christian themselves doesn't bear much weight.  In fact, it's sometimes very helpful that these writings do have a theological element to them, because that can help clarify truth when the writings change or correct themselves. You might have heard of the Criterion of Embarrassment, where we can assume that embarrassing stories tend to be recorded because they are true, and that people don't usually make up stories that show themselves in a negative light. A variant of that can be applied to Christian writing, as there are plenty of details in the earliest Christian sources that make it more difficult to assert certain theological truths. As an example, Mark includes a baptism of Jesus by John for the forgiveness of sins, but of course, Jesus by Christian theology is supposed to be sinless. Matthew includes this story, likely using the same source as Mark, but includes John feeling unworthy to baptize him, and shifting the decision to get baptized onto Jesus. If Jesus were some sort of construct or amalgamation of theological and historical information, the expectation would be far fewer of these inconsistencies as the details of his (hypothetically fictional) life were assembled by early Christians. Why would someone make up a story with no theological purpose for this fictional theological entity?"
72463	0	a	"Josephus' ""Testimonium Flavianum"" is often cited as the only ""non-christian"" source that mentions Jesus directly.  Josephus' *Antiquities* actually mentions Jesus twice. The so-called ""Testimonium"" at *Ant.* XVIII.63-4 is the longer of the two and Mythicists lean on the (minority) view that it is a wholesale interpolation rather than an account of Jesus that later Christian scribes altered and embellished. But then there is the other reference to him, in Ant. XX.200. And that one is almost universally regarded as authentic.  In it Josephus talks about the desposition of the high priest Ananus and says this was triggered by Ananus illegally executing some people including a certain James ""brother of that Jesus who was called Messiah"". It would be very strange for later Christian scribes to invent this elaborate episode just to insert a passing mention of Jesus in a passing mention of his brother. Nor is it clear why they would bother to do so, given that no-one questioned Jesus' existence until the eighteenth century and so there is no motive for this insertion. So this reference seems to be genuinely Josephan.  The events in this account took place in 62 AD, when Josephus was 26. He lived in Jerusalem where these events took place and was a member of the priestly caste, so he would have followed what happened closely. So for him to refer to this James, his older contemporary and fellow Jerusalemite, by reference to his brother Jesus means that Josephus was pretty clear who both Jesus and James were. As ancient evidence goes, this is actually remarkably direct and its nature - in a passing aside - makes it hard to accept as anything but clear evidence Jesus existed."

72466	0	a	> Very interested to know what non-Christian historians think of the argument above about 1st Corinthians 15:3-8 (which I originally read in 'The Case for Christ', a Christian source).  I'm not really sure how faith would play into this, regardless of what I might think of the claims within the passage, the passage certainly exists and thus reflects of the belief of the person writing it. That Paul, writing in the 50s, believed Jesus to be a real person is decent evidence that Jesus was real.  Now there have been skeptic writers such as Richard Carrier who have argued that this passage is not referring to a real person but rather to a vision figure, but at a certain point all the skeptical arguments start adding up to require far more special pleading than simply believing Jesus to be a historical figure. It is very easy for me as an atheist to believe that a preacher from Galilee existed in the early first century CE, it is very hard for me to believe that multiple independent accounts of a made up figure would correspond in so many details.
72467	0	a	>talondearg's answer does not mention Paul's letters,  It does:  >>Then you should factor in how you account for other early Christian literature, including the other NT documents, and documents written shortly after, for example Papias, quoted later in Eusebius’ Ecclesiastical History, claims to have directly inquired about the apostles’ teaching, and so is about a 3rd generation source. **In regards to the other NT documents, most scholars date the earliest of Paul’s letters to the early 50s.** So you must account for the origin of Christian communities through Asia Minor and Greece before the 50s. 
72468	0	a	> Very interested to know what non-Christian historians think of the argument above about 1st Corinthians 15:3-8   For most scholars, both confessional and non-confessional, the debate on the historicity of Jesus has long been settled. The preponderance of evidence suggests that Jesus did exist. The only time you ever see New Testament scholars of either stripe engage in the question of his existence is when they're batting away the extreme fringe mythicist position, which is mostly only popular among lay online skeptics. Of the hundreds and hundreds of scholars who specialize in the field, there are maybe only two or three who accept the mythicist position, about the same amount who might suggest that Jesus was a sorcerer, or that he was an alien, or what have you. It's simply not a view that's taken very seriously. So when you do see scholars approach the subject, it's typically out of exasperation. The populist NT scholar, Bart Ehrman (much beloved by the skeptical community for his textual criticism), only wrote his book *Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth* because he was tired of fielding that question from his online followers who were held under the sway of skeptic favorites like Robert Price and Richard Carrier.  But getting to the heart of your question, here Ehrman summarizes his take on the passage in *Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth*  >> And so both the literary character of 1 Corinthians 15:3–5 and the logic of Paul’s understanding of the resurrection show that he thought that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus were recent events. I should stress that this is the view of all of our sources that deal with the matter at all. ... That Jesus lived recently is affirmed not only in all four of our canonical Gospels (where, for example, he is associated with John the Baptist and is said to have been born during the reign of the Roman emperor Augustus, under the rulership of the Jewish king Herod, and so on); it is also the view of all of the Gospel sources—Q (which associates Jesus with John the Baptist), M, L—and of the non-Christian sources such as Josephus and Tacitus (who both mention Pilate). These sources, I should stress, are all independent of one another; some of them go back to Palestinian traditions that can readily be dated to 31 or 32 CE, just a year or so after the traditional date of Jesus’s death.  The non-Christians NT scholar Maurice Casey likewise agreed in his book, *Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths?*  >> It should therefore be even more obvious in the case of 1 Cor. 15.3-7 that Paul received this tradition directly from human beings who passed it on to him, and that when he preached to the Corinthians c. 54 CE, he handed it on to them. This is accordingly straightforward evidence that Paul, earlier members of the church, and the Corinthian community, knew perfectly well that Jesus' life and death had taken place recently, and that believers, including some people who knew him while he was alive, believed that he had risen from the dead. This is what Doherty and other mythicists do not wish to know.  The non-Christian scholar James Crossley has suggested he accepts 1 Cor. 15 as good evidence for the historical Jesus in debates he's had on the resurrection (which he does not accept on historical grounds), and if you read other non-Christian scholars, it's generally accepted that the passage is very early, and was handed down to Paul orally. Again, most scholars are not using it to demonstrate that Jesus actually existed, since that's a given. Also, both confessional and non-confessional biblical scholars cite one another extensively, work together in research groups, peer review, and the like. It's been my impression that it's mostly only in the lay world do you get this idea that the two groups are somehow distinct, and that if you want to get the unbiased lowdown, you have to go with non-Christians. All historians have a bias, but professional academic historians typically work hard to leave those biases at the door, and strive for objectivity. They don't always accomplish that, but I think you'd be surprised at how well they do. Some of the least traditional/liberal exegesis I've ever read came from self-proclaimed confessional scholars.
72469	0	a	"> I wonder if u/talondearg can provide an example of a similar historical figure to whom we afford the latitude of not having any proof of his existence.  I'm not u/talondearg, but I can give you an example of a figure with far less support: Zarathustra/Zoroaster. He is generally thought to have been a cleric in Central Asia in around 1300 BC. The main piece of evidence is the _Gathas_, seventeen great hymns which were orally transmitted for about 2000 years before being written down. However, due to strong traditions of oral transmission and a strict verse meter, they preserve their extremely archaic dialect of Avestan well, and they appear to have been composed by a single person with little alteration from later tradition than you would otherwise expect (which are present in a wide range of other oral and literary writings of the prophet in both younger Avestan and Middle Persian).  Notably, Zoroastrian tradition holds that Zarathustra lived around 600 BC. It was only in the 19th century that the great philologist Martin Haug realized on analysis and comparison with the Rgveda, that the Gathas must predate 1000 BC. Since Zarathustra lived in a pre-historic society, it is impossible to find any direct evidence for his existence, but it is still accepted by virtually every scholar, even those who are incredibly sceptical of usage of the Gathas as a source of biographical information or theology (for reasons I will not bore you with).  The kind of ""proof"" some people expect to find for Jesus is incredibly rare except for people who were prominent enough to have coins minted, personally authored influential texts, or in some other way profoundly influenced society."

I think that misrepresents how I see historical arguments working, and continues the line of argument that sets up a standard of 'proof' and then does history. I would not state that ""the existence of Christians is proof of Jesus"", because that's an invalid argument by itself. I would say that the existence of Christians is a data point which requires explanation, and in light of all the data, Jesus or a ""figure like Jesus to the point where what difference would it make to call him something else"", is the best reasonable conclusion."

Otherwise, contemporary sources would not refer to him as a singular person and his followers as such.  It's not a perfect claim, but it's not one without, arguably, significant merit either. 
72472	0	a	The idea that you can assume the nonexistence of a purportedly-historical figure, as if that were some kind of default hypothesis, is methodologically suspect and unprovable. There’s no convincing explanation for *why* we should expect their to be more evidence than what we do have. The reality is that we have a limited and selective body of evidence for everything that happened in the ancient world. So we have to infer what we think is the most plausible narrative from the body of evidence that we do have. You just can’t expect absolute proof of every event in ancient history.   There are lots of reasons to suspect that Jesus existed. We have multiple, independent, early attestation. Things like the criterion of embarrassment suggest that the Gospel writers had to work around historical memory in order to build the story they wanted to tell. Christianity uniquely depends on the life and works of Jesus in a way other religions don’t, so it’s hard to imagine how the movement started if Jesus never existed, at least without making other assumptions for which we have less proof. There’s no convincing explanation, at all, for why and how Christianity developed if not from a movement that claimed to be based on Jesus’s followers.   Of course the existence of Christians around the time Jesus is reported to have lived is evidence. How else could you explain their beliefs? There’s no parallel anywhere of people making up a mythical being and then claiming that he was actually a historical person who lived in or near their lifetimes. 
72473	0	a	The earliest source we have on Hannibal is Polybius, who at the very least was writing 60-70 years after the Second Punic war, and Hannibal was significantly more influential in his own day than Jesus is. If you go into figures who were not some of the most famous in the entire ancient world this becomes even easier--Gnaeus Naevius, for example, is in many ways the father of Latin literature (or one of the fathers) and the earliest surviving mention of him would be in Cicero, well over a century after his death.
72474	0	a	Sorry, I meant mainstream historians as opposed to myself / Lee Strobel (a Christian journalist), who wrote 'The Case for Christ'. I will edit my post.
72475	0	a	A follow up question here if I may? Why does Paul's version of events when discussing Jesus count for anything in terms of whether or not Jesus was real?  He never met Jesus, and was at least partly to blame for the conflict of ideas about preaching with the actual apostles.    So doesn't the Bible really rule Paul out here as decent evidence?  Just because Paul believed (or said he believed) in Jesus doesn't really seem a good yardstick - especially as Paul was getting a free ride travelling all around the Med and Near East off the back of preaching that belief; and that he couldn't even get his theology straight with the core members of the new religion?
72476	0	a	No worries then - I see how it could be read that way, although that wasn't how I read it at first. Apologies for the miscommunication. :)
72477	0	a	A free ride?   Paul worked a job to support his preaching. The one recorded sermon we have largely seems to be met with a yawn by the audience. People just ask what in the world he is talking about, and decide he's proclaiming a new deity.  Christians themselves were total nobodies, a sect of a sect of a minority ethnic group under Roman rule. When they're eventually noticed, it's because people say they have orgies and drink blood, and that by refusing to make token sacrifices to the Roman gods (a sign of fealty to Roman rule), they keep getting themselves executed.   Even then no one really cares about them until Nero blamed the Great Fire of Rome on them 67 CE, kicking off the first systematic persecution of Christians specifically.   They also don't join the Jewish revolts that wipe out a few Legions before being slaughtered in turn and their temple at Jerusalem destroyed, making it very clear  that they're not Jewish any more. That's in 66 CE, one year before the Great Fire.   There's a few footnotes mentioning then in passing or asking for guidance on how to deal with them in some Roman sources, but until they become the scapegoats they have no standing in society.   In fact, they're rather famous for recruiting the dregs of Roman society until they manage to start poaching Stoics into the fold, a philosophy that was well represented in the elite. (A lot of the theological language in the New Testament is shamelessly appropriated Stoic philosophical jargon.)  Paul himself reports being shipwrecked a few times, imprisoned a few others, and just generally having a wretched go of it.   Then some Jewish leaders accuse him of blasphemy and other unspecified crimes, to which he exercises his right as a Roman citizen to appeal directly to Caesar (a move that apparently surprised his accusers, who may not have known he was a Roman citizen).  But things don't go very well, and much like Pilate and Jesus, he ends up the victim of internal political wrangling and Roman concessions to Jewish intransigence, and he's beheaded in Rome, and dies.  There is a lot that can be said about Paul, good and bad. But saying he was getting a 'free ride' on some kind of Christian gravy train and therefore had an incentive to lie where his bread was buttered just isn't true.   No doubt Paul would say his life was better for becoming a Christian. But a purely secular account of the consequences of his conversion would imply he got the very raw end of the deal.  
72478	0	a	The argument here though, isn't that Jesus rose from the dead, performed miracles, etc. It's that he was a person who started a religion. Just as many other people through history have done.  And while I don't believe Joseph Smith's claims that he found a set of golden plates with records of Israelites in ancient America which only he could read... I do believe he existed. Just like I believe that L.Ron Hubbard existed, that Gerald Gardner existed, etc. I assume that Gerald Gardner wrote stuff, but not being very interested in Wiccanism I've never read anything by him, only by other Wiccans; that doesn't make it likely to me that he didn't exist. If he didn't exist, who started Wiccanism? Someone else could have started it I guess, but why would they make up a different person and claim that person started it? Possible, admittedly (perhaps they believed the fake person was more believable than them), just very unlikely. Most people who start a religion claim they are the prophet, they are the chosen one, they have the special secret knowledge, they should get your money/loyalty/worship/daughters. Not that someone else was the Chosen One, and they're just a follower.  Or, to take a more classic example, Gautema Buddha. Did he exist? I've never read anything he wrote. There's less roughly contemporary sources about him than Jesus. All we have is other people saying he existed. But... why wouldn't he? Someone started it. It may be that he only came up with some parts of Buddhism, and others were later ascribed to him. There's a reasonable chance that he wasn't really a Prince who gave everything up. But there's no great reason to assume that Buddhism was started by, say, 10 people in South India who met up, came up with a religion, and then made up a guy called Buddha who they can claim told them this stuff. It's possible of course... but it's more likely a guy called Buddha came up with at least the basic ideas of the philosophy that evolved into Buddhism.  Essentially, as was mentioned earlier, while we cannot prove utterly that Jesus existed, the evidence suggests far more that there was a preacher called Yeshua, from Nazareth (a not particularly significant town), than there wasn't. And there's nothing strange or weird about a preacher called Yeshua, believed by his followers to be the Messiah, having lived about 2000 years ago. Preachers start religions; indeed, as you mention, we've seen that many times in the 19th and 20th century. There's nothing particularly unbelievable about it.  Overall, it's just far more likely that there was a preacher called Yeshua than that someone made a religion based on a fake person who they claim lived just a few years before. Not impossible of course! Just far less likely than it being a real person.  Of course, you mentioned other mythical people; but Greeks didn't write about Hercules having done stuff 10 years before, or having personally met Hercules, or having argued with his younger brother. The Greek myths exist in the distant past, not the recent (more easily checkable) present.  If you want to know more, this is discussed a fair bit in some of the answers on the faq. There's a good one about how the biographies of Jesus don't fit it into the same kind of mythological tropes used in Greek Myths, but are more like different people trying to fit a real person's lifestory into a mythological narrative (things like how he was famously from Nazareth, when everyone knew the Messiah should be from Bethlehem; why not just say he was from Bethlehem? Why have Nazareth be mentioned at all? And so on).
72479	0	a	Was it an open or a secret vote? I think that's very relevant to the op's question.
72480	0	a	Ok, so as far as I can tell the vote was anonymous, thus the problem is that we might never know who did not vote for Hitler in that meeting.  When reviewing the fragmentary early membership lists of the NSDAP, there are a few possibilities who could have voted against Hitler but the most likely is Anton Drexler.  Drexler was one of the  founders of the NSDAP (then named Deutsche Arbeiter Partei, German Workers' Party, DAP) in 1919 and Hitler's main rival for party chairman in 1921. Drexler who had been the second chair of the party had taken over first chair in 1920 when his predecessor Karl Harrer resigned over conflicts with Hitler. A similar fate awaited Drexler, who was unable to mount any serious resistance to Hitler. Hitler had parctically become indispensable for the party by 1921 because of his success as an orator and he guarded that role as well as what he understood as ideological purity of the movement jealously.  In 1920 and 21 the NSDAP was plagued by a shortage of money and by being one among the many völkisch movements in Germany. To alleviate both of these problems, they attempted to merge with other, similar, parties such as the DSP and the Deutsche Werksgemeinschaft. Hitler opposed this because it threatened his supremacy in the party, so he used his own role as leverage. Successfully crashing the DSP negotiations, he attempted the same in connection with the DWG negations but failed and so, in a fit of rage, he threatened to resign several times in 1920 and 1921. Every time, fearing the loss of their popular orator and really, the only thing that set them apart form the dime a dozen völisch parties in Germany, the NSDAP leadership placated Hitler by giving him what he wanted.  Again sent to to convince Hitler not to resign, Drexler asked him in July 1921 what he wanted. Hitler demanded chairmanship and extraordinary powers within the party. While Drexler and Hitler showed their unity on July 1926, Drexler as the current chairman was obviously the choice for those who opposed Hitler within the party and there seem to have been at least some because according to Ian Kershaw, 3000 anonymous pamphlets attacking Hitler had been prepared by the time, the members' meeting rolled around.  So, it might have been Drexler who voted against Hitler, possibly expecting a victory of himself, which obviously didn't pan out. Drexler left the NSDAP when it was dissolved after the Hitler Putsch and only rejoined in 1933 never again to gain any kind of political role until his death in 1942.  Other possibilities include Gottfired Feder, prominent member of the anti-Capitalist movement within the NSDAP, who later served in minor roles in the Nazi adminsitration; the first chairman, Harrer, though it is unknown if he was even there (he died of natural causes in 1926); or one of the lesser known early members about whom little information can be found such as Hans Baumann or Karl Beggel; or it could have been Hitler himself following convention in some parties of abstaining to vote for himself though given his personality that seems rather unlikely. In the end, it probably is not possible to find out with any kind of certainty.  Edit: Apparently, Robert Payne claims that the dissenting vote came from a man called Rudolf Posch, a party member and librarian (who is not to be confused with the Austrian Social Democrat of the same name). I have no idea where this claim comes from. Neither Payne nor Joseph Howard Tyson who also mentions this in his book on Dietrich Eckhart have that fact footnoted, though it is likely that one of them got that fact from the other. I could go and look up his Nazi party file though according to the information in the search engine of the German Bundesarchiv it is rather thin and it seems that man never made any sort of impact on the history of the NSDAP again and what became of him is unknown.  2nd edit: for more on the conflict between Hitler and others in the party see /u/boffcheese comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5bs2hk/hitler_won_control_of_the_nazi_party_with_an/d9r1se1/)  Sources:  * Ian Kershaw: Hitler.  * Wolfgang Horn: Der Marsch zur Machtergreifung.

72481	0	a	Were you allowed to vote for yourself? Or is it known for definite that there was someone voting against the grain?
72482	0	a	More on that, I'm ignorant of German politics/governing of the time.  Who ran against him?  Was it even an election?   I thought he did what was essentially a coupe where the leading party simply stepped down for him and his popularity. 
72483	0	a	So to weigh in a little as well on the Rudolf Posch factor, I would second /u/commiespaceinvader's caution in accepting the claim as factual. The support for the claim is almost non-existent. Checking through a number of books I have on the rise of Hitler, I could find no mention of his small role in history, and the use of Google books resulted in only **[two hits](https://www.google.com/search?q=Rudolf+Posch&oq=ru&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j69i61j69i57j69i59j0.1215j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=%22Rudolf+Posch%22+hitler&tbm=bks)** (plus one Italian book which seems to refer to someone else, a religious figure). Neither book seems to cite the source of their information, and the other mentions on the internet, [a few blogs, trace back to those books.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Rudolf+Posch&oq=ru&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j69i61j69i57j69i59j0.1215j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=%22Rudolf+Posch%22+hitler) The fact that this thread is already one of the top hits on Google when you search for him suggests how little information is out there, and the fact that there doesn't seem to be any other published mentions should make us very suspicious. Commie and I love a good mystery, and are still seeing if there is *anything* to corroborate the claim, but neither author seems to provide a verifiable citation, which makes it quite difficult. Certainly interested in seeing if anyone else has some luck on tracking down earlier mentions in the published literature, or better yet, a primary source!
72484	0	a	"So for those of you who can't read German (please translate next time):  ""It was only on July 29 1921 that in the Circus Krone an exceptional gathering of members took place in which Hitler was voted unanimously head of the party (Führer) with 554 cast votes. The NSDAP was now fully aligned to the person of Hitler and his vision of Nationalsocialism was now binding"" "
72485	0	a	You are more or less correct. Hitler came to lead the NSDAP after the events sometimes referred to as the July Crisis. The Crisis began while Hitler was away from Munich, which was where the party was based, visiting Berlin on a fundraising tour, when discussions took place between members of the German Socialist Party and the NSDAP, as well as another group that had recently appeared on the right wing political circuit, the *Deutsche* *Werkgemeinschaft*.  The DSP, the NSDAP, and the new *Werkgemeinschaft* held many of the same beliefs and aims. With their shared values, the expansion of political activities that a merge would bring, and additional popular speakers headlining their rallies, the combined party would be a significant force on the national stage. The influence of Adolf Hitler in a larger party with other popular speakers would be severely diminished, something that must have been, if not an overriding aim of the merger, a pleasant silver lining. For the majority of the committee, Hitler had too much influence over the party due to his popularity with the membership, but was the driving force behind the party's growing success.   When Hitler himself heard of this meeting, supposedly tipped off by an ally on the committee, he returned to Bavaria and ambushed the representatives sent to discuss the alliance. He ranted and raved, denying any value in cooperation and insulting the head of the *Deutsche* *Werkgemeinschaft*, Dr Otto Dickel, who Hitler held in contempt for his philosophical approach to politics. He continued his tirade for three hours before storming out of the building. Having seen this all before, (previous attempted mergers with the DSP had failed due to Hitler's tantrums) the representatives of the NSDAP calmly continued with the negotiations and agreed to present Dr Dickel’s proposals to the full committee. Hitler resigned the same day, the 11th of July, declaring that the committee had gone against the wishes of the membership by even considering a merger, and that “I will and can not be any longer a member of such a movement.”    While some members of the committee were quite happy to be rid of Hitler, others saw this as a fatal blow to the party that could lead to a split within the ranks. Within two days, Anton Drexler (the current Chairman)asked under what conditions Hitler would return to the party, possibly expecting him to request a ban on future party mergers. Instead, Hitler went on the offensive, demanding the position of chairman, along with dictatorial powers, guarantees that the party would remain based in Munich, that the party programme would remain unchanged, ***and*** a ban on future party mergers. A day later the committee agreed to his conditions due to his “immense knowledge” and his “unusual talent as a speaker”. Hitler returned to the party on the 26th of July, and received the near-unanimous agreement from the membership for his ascension as Chairman on the 29th, which now had the vast powers he had demanded.

72486	0	a	Not a problem! I was quite pleased to see this thread, since I gave a presentation on the topic just last week so it's fresh in my head.  In regards to the source of Hitler's popularity, he was a very engaging speaker that tapped into the discontent in his audiences. Despite the clips of his speeches that are often shown in documentaries, of his shouting and waving his arms around, they were only the crescendos of his speeches, which lasted hours. No one could keep shrieking at that volume or enjoy listening to it for that amount of time, instead Hitler altered his tone and volume depending on the mood of the crowd and what he was saying. In the early days, when he was still speaking in Beer Halls, he took the unorthodox step of conducting his speeches on a table in the middle of the room, rather than on a podium, putting him in the middle of his audience and connecting with him.  What he spoke about were every problem that Germany, and Germans, suffered, whose fault these problems were (Jews, marxists, other countries etc), and what should be done to fix them. Defeat in the war was not a sudden event that happened in 1918 and was then moved on from; Versailles was only signed in 1919, and went into effect in 1920. In 1921 parts of Germany were occupied by French and Belgian forces to oversee reparation payments, and in 1923 this occupation was expanded. The occupation, the reparations, and the passive resistance against said occupation causing significant damage to the German economy, adding financial burdens to ordinary Germans in addition to the humiliation of a defeat they had not been fully expecting; a professor once told me that after the armistice many Germans believed that the war had ended in a draw, an uneven draw that was against Germany, but a draw none-the-less. Defeat was an unexpected, and nasty, surprise. While this was occurring, Germany had to deal with revolution, and in Munich (the base of the NSDAP and Hitler) the city was under the control of a Soviet-style government for a few months before being crushed by a combined force of Freikorps and Berlin-government troops, after which hundreds were executed.  This was the Munich Hitler was speaking to, and he blamed these problems on easily identifiable yet vague enemies, such as international Jewry, and declared solutions that would bring Germany back to the imperial grandour it once held. Coupled with a compelling style of oratory, it is no surprise his star rose so quickly.
72487	0	a	This was unrelated to leadership of Germany, the country. This was a vote within the party in 1921, more than ten years prior to the NSDAP's rise to power.
72488	0	a	"Although I'll swing back to the circumstances around 1876, to start off, I'm going to turn this question on its head and look at why voter turnout *declined* in the elections following. If you look at [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/rjFrb) you can see that while 1876 was the highpoint, it wasn't exactly an anomaly, and voter turnout was consistently high in the elections preceding it. It sticks out because, although the drop wasn't *immediately* afterwards, it certainly preceded the continuing decline in voter turnout that would mark the next half-century.  So why did voting decline in that period? Well, one of the most simple reasons to look at is Jim Crow. While under Reconstruction, black men (women being generally deprived of the vote) could, for the most part, go to the polls and exercise their right to vote, this began to change after Reconstruction was ended (not to say it didn't happen before, just not as effectively), and the Redeemer governments worked through various means to disenfranchise vast swathes of voters in the American South. The effect of this can't be underrated. While in the 1876 election the South saw turnout roughly comparable to the rest of the country, at 75 percent, vote suppression methods such as literacy tests not to mention outright fraud, saw the turnout decline to 46 percent at the turn of the century. By the 1924 election, *19 percent* of those theoretically eligible to vote were actually showing up at the polls. And to be sure, while the primary target was black voters, many poorer, illiterate whites were disenfranchised too, despite ""loopholes"" to grandfather many of them in. In Louisiana, for instance, while 90 percent of black voters were barred from the polls, 60 percent of whites were as well. While Jim Crow should absolutely be understood as primarily a racial regime, it was quite oligarchical as well, with power being concentrated in the hands mostly of upper-class whites, who wanted to share it with no one.  This allows us to circle back somewhat though to look at 1876, and why it would be slightly above the average of the time though. During the Reconstruction era there were *real efforts* to mobilize poor voters of both races by the Radical Republicans. The example I'm most familiar with was that led by Mahone in Virginia whose Readjuster movement controlled the state for a brief time in the late 1870s-early'80s, propelled by populist support from a coalition of black voters and poor whites. I won't spend to much time on him as I've written about him before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6fent8/did_longstreet_and_other_confederates_really_seek/dihn6ym/?context=3) but the short of it is that in the post-war era, but before Jim Crow laws took hold, we can see a lot of political agitation that struck at the white Democratic establishment in the South that was attempting to reclaim power, and that *for a time* they enjoyed some successes. The 1876 election in particular we can look at as a watershed, with both sides of the argument over Reconstruction seeing heavy stakes. And of course Tilden won the popular vote, but lost anyways, as part of a deal that did end Reconstruction anyways. That cessation meant the evaporation of the Federal protections that allowed those insurgent political movements to compete on a roughly level playing field. Changes weren't immediate, and varied state by state - in Virginia for instance the Readjusters remained in power until 1883, when race riots days before the election were used by the Democrats to stoke voter fears - but it nevertheless meant that the suppression of the black vote and the poor white vote was able to start, a process which wasn't immediate, and took time to take full effect.  It can also be said that while Jim Crow was unique to the American South, similar political tactics were not unknown throughout the country, just in different ways. In the Northern and Western states, turnout had dropped to 55 percent by the 1920 election, after all, and while it cannot be blamed on *institutional* barriers such as those in the South, responses to political mobilization by immigrants and lower-class groups *outside* the South by political elites saw attempts at ""demobilizing what they judged to be the least desirable components of the electorate"". They may not have been legally barring them from the polls, but through the late 1800s and early 20th century, they certainly were attempting to dissuade them from showing up.  So as I have tickets for Thor at 10, and my wife is giving me *the look*, I'll wrap this up with a quick summation. In short, voter turnout in the United States was consistently fairly high up until the 1880s. The apex of turnout in 1876 isn't exactly an anomaly if we look at the turnouts in votes around it, such as 1868 at 78.1%, or 1880 at 79.4%, but it does coincide with a period in American history rife with political upheaval, not just the American South, still on the tail end of Reconstruction, but nationwide, with Populist movements in the ascendant. The end of the century, and the early 1900s, thus provide a stark contrast, as attempts both at institutional vote suppression, as well as simple 'demobilization' of cohorts of voters, lead to a decline in turnout nationwide.

72490	0	a	"To discuss the 1876 presidential election, let's rewind the clock...  FIRST to the 1860 presidential election, where 81.2% of eligible voters (white men) participated. This heated election was a four-way split with Abraham Lincoln (Republican), John C. Breckinridge (the breakaway pro-slavery Southern Democrat), Stephen A. Douglas (the mainstream Democrat, often referred to as a ""Northern Democrat""), and John Bell (Constitutional Union, a third party neutral on slavery issues). The electoral college went to Lincoln, sealing his victory, but the popular vote was not in his favor (39.8%, meaning 60~% of Americans did not vote for Lincoln). Lincoln's election - and the indifference re: secession from the lame duck president, James Buchanan - among *many* other issues regarding slavery - provoked South Carolina into leaving the Union, followed by several states in early 1861 and the establishment of the Confederacy.  NEXT presidential election is 1864 during the war itself. Turn-out continues to be high (73.8%) which is  impressive considering the number of white men away from home in the battlefield and the new introduction of absentee voting. As to be expected, there is widespread voter fraud. The Union soldiers backed Lincoln, though, and he won the day again. The Civil War ends in 1865, and Lincoln is assassinated soon after. He is replaced by his Vice President, Andrew Johnson, who Republicans do not want to remain in power because he was a bit too sympathetic with white Southerners and showed bigotry towards newly freed African-Americans.  NEXT presidential election is 1868: former Civil War Union general, Ulysses S. Grant (Republican) against New York Governor Horatio Seymour (Democrat). Another high turnout (78.1%). It's electoral slaughter with Grant winning triple digits against Seymour's ninety. But, as with Lincoln's 1860 election, Grant does have a struggle in the popular vote, where Seymour receives a healthy 47~%. This is the first time African-Americans, newly freed from slavery, could vote. In contrast, some white Southerners had not yet gained back their voting rights from their treasonous turn against the U.S. government. Entire states (VA, MS, TX) were termed ""unreconstructed"" and had no electoral vote.  NEXT presidential election is 1872: the incumbent Ulysses S. Grant (Republican) against Horace Greeley (Liberal Republican, a breakaway party from the Republican party). The Democrats did not run anyone, throwing their support behind Greeley. The turn-out (71.3%) was less high, in part because of the confusion with the Democrats' absence and the split Republican ticket. Still much higher than we see today, which fluctuates in the 50s%. Very strangely, Greeley actually died during the vote counting process. Even more strangely, his wife had died the week before the election, so he spent his few weeks left on Earth in a grief-stricken daze.   And FINALLY we get to the 1876 presidential election. Presidential elections for the past four cycles had been intense, fraught, and significant for the future of America. You have the spoiler number: 81.8% of eligible voters participated. Certainly, by 1876, American men recognized the importance of the presidential election and their individual vote in the race. In particular, there was a real obsession with what would happen between the Republican and Democratic parties, as they've undergone great stresses in the last sixteen years. Yes, the Civil War was won, but Reconstruction had taken a real toll on both parties. Unlike in the 1872 presidential election, Democrats decided to run and campaign hard.  Our two candidates: Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes (Republican) against New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden (Democrat). Incumbent Republican President Grant decides not to run for a third term, in part because of accusations of corruption in his administration. Democrats had not won a presidential election since the 1856 presidential election twenty years prior.  Issue 1:  White Southerners hated Reconstruction. The white leaders of the Southern states were sick of U.S. federal forces' occupation and influence on state/local governments in the South. Thus, the white South seemed poised to vote Democrat. During the 1876 election season, numerous incidents of pro-Democrat, anti-black violence occurred, including an ugly series of events throughout South Carolina (remember: the first state to secede in 1860). One such event, the Hamburg Massacre, made it clear to white Southerners that anti-black violence / voter intimidation would not be stopped by federal Republican officials, leading to more violence and voter fraud on Election Day. Consequentially, resentment towards ""carpetbagger"" Northerners and Republicans was now intertwined with resentment towards freed African-Americans. Note that in 1876 (11 years post-war) three ex-Confederate states still were under Republican governmental control: Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana. And white Southerners hated this ongoing federal Reconstruction: it denied them self-government. They wanted it over. The Democrats agreed. Strangely, so did many Republicans by 1876. It didn't matter: the Democrats had a stronghold in the South founded on resentment of federal intervention and a rejection of black progress.  Issue 2: The Civil War was not fully over. Many Republicans  resented the rise of the ex-Confederate back to his full voting rights. One campaign song, [""The Voice of the Nation's Dead,""](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.23702100/) included lyrics such as ""Our Country from all Traitors we must save"" (traitors being ex-Confederate Southerners) and ""Tilden aided Treason"" (re: Tilden's conservative anti-Republican views). Republicans contrasted Hayes' valorous military service in the Union Army (he was repeatedly wounded but continued to serve) with Tilden's war-time criticism of Lincoln and disdain for Republicanism. Republicans even accused Tilden and Democrats of [inspiring intimidation and violence of Northern men](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.12804700/)  (the so-called ""carpetbaggers"", who brought all their belongings to the South in bags made from carpet) who had relocated South at the polls. Republicans ""Waved the Bloody Shirt"" of the Civil War, as it was known then.  Issue 3: In 1876, the United States was struggling economically. Since 1873, the country had been suffering through an economic depression and financial panic, which incited frustration against the incumbent Republican party, who many blamed. More people show up to vote to expel the incumbent party when times are rough. (A more recent example of this case is Herbert Hoover and FDR in the Great Depression.) So, surprisingly, the Democrats have an edge by having NOT been in presidential power for a while.  Issue 4: That strange third party from the 1872 presidential election: the Liberal Republicans. These undecided men had to find a new home, and the Democrats went in for the embrace. They took on the policies of Liberal Republicans and propped up Tilden as their candidate: an anti-Tammany Hall, anti-corruption honest man. Liberal Republicans, who had been repulsed by the corruption in Reconstruction and the Grant administration in 1868 and 1872 terms, were pleased with the nomination. BUT the Republican nominee Rutherford B. Hayes looked equally as good, if not better, for his life-long dedication to honor and honesty, and of course, this was naturally their home party. When Republicans rejected a candidate interested in the spoils system and chose Hayes, the party won back many Liberal Republicans, though notably not all.  Issue 5: The swing states - oh the swing states! If you look at [the electoral map for the 1876 election,](https://www.270towin.com/1876_Election/) you'll see some states far North have gone blue (Democrat). Tilden campaigned hard in his home state of New York, and he won it (note: NY had gone Republican in 1860, 1864, and 1872). Several other states swung Democrat that were situated around New York, such as New Jersey and Connecticut, which were key to achieving electoral victory. Further west, Indiana also proved to be a contested ground, with the difference of five thousand voters turning the state in favor of Tilden and the Democrats.   The swing states added up: by the end of the Election Night, Tilden and the Democratic Party had amassed 184 electoral college votes, one shy of winning the whole thing. But those three aforementioned states under federal reconstruction - Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana - were in dispute. (So was Colorado, which had just become a state). These 20 votes cast the whole election into confusion, leading to a massively political/cultural mess called the Compromise of 1877 (which put Hayes into the presidency and officially ended federal Reconstruction).  Oh - and finally, perhaps most importantly - Issue 6: Fraud. So much fraud. The percentage - 81.8% - is based on *reported* numbers of ballots cast. Corruption raised hell during the 1876 presidential election in terms of counting votes. South Carolina boasted 101% of eligible voters participated in the election. Florida and Louisiana similarly saw inflated numbers. Democrats threatened both black and white Republicans with violence in the South. Not to be outdone, several Northern states also saw inflated and almost impossible numbers of eligible voters coming to the polls. This massive amount of fraud led to the electoral confusion and disputed Southern states, which in turn brought about the Compromise of 1877.  So whether 81.8% of eligible American voters in 1876 actually participated... will never be known. But, without a doubt, the 1876 presidential election was both impressively strange and contentious.  *Final note:* I do not do political history by trade.

Anyways, a few loose ends that bear commenting upon to round out what I cranked out this morning. So having looked a little at the election of 1876, and how it is a little higher than normal, but not too out of line, this leads to another question... Why was 1872 a *very* noticeable anomaly at 71.3%, bounded in 1868 by a turnout of 78.1%, and of course 1876 at 81.8%.   Let's start in 1868. That year, Grant ran against Horatio Seymour, a northern Democrat from New York, and won with a fairly respectable vote lead. He was especially buoyed by a strong performance in the South, winning many of the former Confederate states. How though? Well, an astute observer might notice that despite a much higher turnout *percentage*, the actual numbers of voters was lower, which would be somewhat counter-intuitive. But, while I have been unable to find any sources which explain *specifically* how that number is calculated, if it is counting eligible voters against turnout, it seems likely that it is accepting the disenfranchisement of many *white* former rebels in the Southern states as legal and proper, and not counting them in the rolls of eligible voters. Certainly, it was the lack of their votes which, unable to balance out the newly enfranchised black vote in the South, helped to support his campaign down there.   This stands in comparison to the 1872 election, where those former rebels had since been reenfranchised, and thus counted in the rolls of eligible voters. But many voters nevertheless chose to stay home, why? Well, check out who was running! Grant was seeking reelection, but his opponent was Horace Greeley - a Republican, not a Democrat! He was riding the Liberal Republican ticket, a splinter party from the Republicans, dissatisfied with Grant and much of what he had done in his first term. They lacked an entirely cohesive platform but generally stood, at the least, for playing nice with the South, and ending or softening the various Federal policies directed there. Greeley had been one of the most forceful voices in the Republican party for sectional reconciliation, and would win its nomination, but it wasn't straight forward, and caused a good deal of acrimony. At the Party Convention which nominated him, he had gone into is not as the favorite, beating out Charles Francis Adams after six ballots. There was enough bitter disagreements after his victory speech and declaration of platform that Adams supporters mostly just went back to the Grant camp, even if begrudgingly, unwilling to support the ""turncoat and traitor"", representative of the lack of cohesion in the movement from the start.  As for the Democrats... they simply didn't run a candidate. As newspaper editor Theodore Tilton wrote in aptly summing up the sentiment followed:  >Since the Democratic party pledges itself to abide by the constitutional amendments [...] and since it wants universal amnesty [...] why not therefore let the better class of Democrats unite with the anti-Grant Republicans?  But the party was dominated by the Northern Democrats, and perhaps the platform was one they could support, but not necessarily one that made voters in the deep south happy, or at least enough so to nominally vote for a non-Democrat. In the end, it was a fairly tepid election, between two candidates who didn't quite endear themselves well. Grant waltzed to reelection with a 11.80 percent margin on the back of an electorate that perhaps wasn't all in for him, but couldn't get behind Greeley's ""motley"" mix of appeals. What it did represent though was the growing dissatisfaction within *some* parts of the Republican party, who tired of Reconstruction which they were becoming convinced was a failure. It was, of course, a conflict that would underpin the next election, as already noted, but with an actual context between Republicans and Democrats, rather than divisions within the Republican Party alone.

72494	0	a	"The answer is ""yes, probably,"" but I have been unable to locate specific numbers. If you're looking for a bodycount of the Queen's (or King's) Guard, nobody that I know of has compiled such a list. Obviously, the units from which the Guards are drawn often see combat overseas, and have fought in battle over the past centuries, but the likeliest incident that I immediately thought of (this is actually linked from the Wikipedia page on the Queen's Guard) was during the [Gordon Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Riots). This was, to the best of my knowledge, the only time when members of the Guard were in a position to fire on people in the city of London, and then actually did so.  As background, the Gordon Riots marked a period of severe civil unrest in London, 1780, as a result of anti-Catholic sentiment and other contributing factors that are not worth getting into here (but mostly boil down into ""Lord Charles Gordon was at fault and that's why we named it after him""). Long story short, on June 2 a number of demonstrators marched on Parliament to deliver a petition, and while the debates were going on inside the demonstrators outside were getting themselves riled up to the point where Members of Parliament were apparently at risk of being killed. The Guards were obliged to clear a path through the crowd in order to allow Parliament to exit, which they did by eleven o'clock in the evening. **This is very probably the best bet to answer your question**: the [Palace of Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster) where Parliament meets is technically a royal residence.  That being said, it seems unlikely that anybody was actually killed during this initial incident. (Of course, the soldiers were armed with musket and bayonet, which aren't great for nonlethal crowd control because they're weapons meant for killing people outright -- see the Boston Massacre for one example of when things went tits-up like that.) Anyways, in the days following the unrest outside of Parliament, the rioters went rampaging through the streets smashing stuff, but most of their targets appear to have been non-royal residences. Among the buildings ransacked were several of the prisons, where the prisoners were set free and mostly escaped recapture; foreign embassies, especially of Catholic nations; the houses of wealthy Catholics; and a few houses of local government officials or nobles perceived to be pro-Catholic in their stance. People *definitely* got killed by soldiers during this later action; the numbers that I am seeing are 210 killed, 75 died in hospital, and 173 wounded. Among the units deployed were units of the Guards, who distinguished themselves defending the Bank of England.  We have no way of knowing exactly how many of the dead can be ascribed to the work of the Guards -- they were not the only regular soldiers present in London at the time, and the city drew upon the support of local county militias to supplement their forces (incidentally, these irregulars seem to have acquitted themselves better during the actual riots). Please also note that the purpose of the rioters was never to attack the king, or his properties: it was an outpouring of anti-Catholic hatred that manifested in attacks on more low-hanging targets. Most of the estates more typically thought of as royal residences (Buckingham Palace in England, Balmoral Castle in Scotland) have more or less escaped such violence over the years.  --  For further reading:  McCormack, Matthew. “Supporting the Civil Power: Citizen Soldiers and the Gordon Riots.” *The London Journal* 37 (2012): 27–41.

72497	0	a	"To add on to this answer somewhat, several British army regiments were called out on the 7th, five days after the initial unrest, and sent to quell riots. This was fairly typical of Britain at the period -- before the concept of a police force separate from the military existed, regiments would be used to put down large areas of unrest.   Anyhow, the regiments involved in the suppression of the riots included the Horse Guards (at the time, the ""Blues"" of the current Blues and Royals, the second-oldest regiment in English/British service); the Foot Guards, the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) as well as various other militia, artillery, and other forces (including the Inns of Court yeomanry). So there were certainly ""royal"" regiments involved in the riots, in the sense that those bodies of soldiers have a special distinction over the regular army.   As an aside, the Lord Mayor of London seems to have been somewhat sympathetic with Gordon, and was actually tried and fined £1,000 for not reading the Riot Act before troops were mobilized. (This was an actual thing that magistrates were supposed to do, formally making an assembly unlawful, before sending in troops or using violence to break it up.) "
72498	0	a	The Foot Guards you see today are rotational battalions and companies of the various regiments. When not doing Guard duty they are training for their other primary purpose, forming the Guards Division of the British Army.  Equipped and trained as mechanized infantry the battalions not on ceremonial duty train like any other. And have seen combat in the Falklands, Persian Gulf War. And past the 20 year rule have all deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan in the GWOT.  Under the parade dress are fully trained active duty British soldiers well versed in their duties as Professional War Fighters and infantry operations as their specific field.

72502	0	a	According to [this website](http://www.in2013dollars.com/1780-GBP-in-2017?amount=1000), £1,000 in 1780 U.K. would be approximately £169,102.89 today.   If that is even slightly accurate, that seems like a hefty fine by today's standards. Was it common for magistrates or parliament to be fined like this? It seems they held him largely accountable for the riots, or did they just need to officially place blame?
72503	0	a	It isn't. It's a great threat when you see cannons pointed down the street at you, and even more once they begin pumping grapeshot into the mob.   However it's a risk, if the intimidation doesn't work, and firing into them doesn't break the crowd, they might be emboldened and simply storm the guns and turn them on their owners.  But it can be effective, in his oh so timely defense of the National Convention on 13 Vendémiaire Napoleon placed a young Joachim Murat in charge of an artillery battery that kept the streets to the Tuileries swept with fire. It led to nearly 1500 dead but it also accomplished his goal of breaking the crowd and also of course ignited his career trajectory from the relative tough spot he had been in.
72504	0	a	So the answer seems from everything ive read to really depend on the time we are speaking about.  But for modern Britain and without delving too deeply into the forbidden 20 year limit the answer is 2 parts. 1 is that most of the time they will not carry ammo with them, and never have it loaded, but may do so in a heightened threat environment or in the face of an immediate attack. 2 is that there is always a presence with armed officers from the Metropolitan Police which would take the fore for initial public safety incidents.   For a good rundown on trying to balance tradition, security, and having armed soldiers surrounded by tourists in exposed positions, the source isn't the best but this piece from the Mail a few years back is a serviceable enough rundown.

72505	0	a	"During the United States' westward colonization in the 19th century, one of the most cohesive groups to take advantage of the overland trails was the Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints), on account of persecution and violence back east. While some did go all the way to California, most overlanding Mormons settled in Utah. Pitching out in Utah Territory ought to have been a refuge/semi-independent existence for the Mormons, but then the 1849+ gold rush happened. And Utah became a necessary transit point for the flood of emigrants to California. Well, transit point and conflict zone.  Because while some emigrants found that Mormons were good to trade with, attitudes often soured very quickly in both directions. Lacking roads, wagon trains and cattle herds rumbled through whatever fields and towns stood in their way, often tearing up the seasons' crops. Mormons who remembered themselves or their ancestors being assaulted and having their property destroyed back in the Midwest, in return, saw their chance to harass emigrants under the excuse that surely they had come from Missouri, Illinois, etc. It's important to remember we are talking about settled, established colonies/territories here. When violent (to people or property) incidents happened, parties went to court--and smashed right into a harshly divided Utah administration split between local, often ecclesiastically-appointed Mormon officials and federal administrators dispatched from Washington.  Basically, *no one* was happy. Emigrants felt they could not get justice from Mormon juries. Mormon officials believed federal delegates were overriding their sovereignty and territory rights. U.S.-sent officials complained that the LDS Church could and did essentially override their own decisions.  And in the 1850s, this concept of popular sovereignty had a peculiar importance in American politics that you might be more familiar with under the phrase ""states' rights""--that is, it needed to serve as a code word, in the politics of President James Buchanan's Democratic party, for the defense of *slavery*. Mormon theological opinions--namely, polygamy--couldn't be allowed to tarnish the image of a seen-as-necessary principle.   With the complaints from Good Protestant Overlanders and fleeing federal officials combined with darkening attitudes towards Mormons and Mormonism as politically damaging, Buchanan by fiat declared a new (non-Brigham Young) governor of Utah and sent a cadre of troops as combination police officers/bodyguards in 1857. Young and the Mormon leadership either did not get this memo or had reasonable experience on which to believe this memo was a purposeful deception: they saw the incoming troops as an invasion force meant to impose martial law and renew persecution of Mormons. So they called up *their* own militia, prepared for doomsday scenarios, and *forbid Mormon residents from dealing with or aiding non-Mormon overlanders.*  As to why the Utah Expedition/Utah War is less often discussed, of course there are the general platitudes like ""you can only study so much in one history class"" ""not enough people were killed to make it a significant war"" ""the U.S. soldiers were kind of wimpy and when the '57-58 winter was bad they kinda just gave up and went home."" But to investigate more specifically to the historical context, I'd like to focus on one brutal event within the time frame of the Utah War: the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  Like other emigrant groups before them, the Baker-Fancher wagon train (named for its leader-organizers, John Baker and Alexander Fancher) out of Arkansas had counted on being able to wheel and deal with Mormon shopkeepers for supplies before they headed through mountains and desert. Not under the new apocalypse-coming statues of the LDS community, though. Frustrated, the Fancher party did two things. First, they stopped to camp at Mountain Meadows pass in southern Utah to rest and consolidate for the weary trip ahead in the face of fewer supplies than they had planned for. Second, they talked a massively violent rhetorical game against the Mormons. *Not only* were they going to give the Mormons trouble, *not only* were the incoming U.S. army troops going to give the Mormons even more trouble, *but*--the clincher--people in the Fancher party ""knew people"" who had oppressed the Mormons right out of Missouri, or maybe--some bragged--maybe they had *been* those people.  Local militia leaders Isaac Haight and John Lee were not about to let this slide. They determined to attack the wagon train while they were camped. They were evil-crafty about it, too--they paid a group of Paiute Indians in cattle to participate in the initial attack in September 1857.   But Lee in particular wasn't satisfied with a few deaths in a skirmish. With the terrified Fanchers huddled down where they could defend themselves but not actually escape (and the threat of winter--and not being able to pass the mountains--looming), he went in to negotiate their surrender. Children and the wounded would leave first, in wagons; women and older children next; finally the men would walk out.  But Lee didn't mean ""surrender,"" he meant ""lambs to the slaughter."" The Mormon soldiers massacred the entire wagon train. Only a handful of very young children were allowed to survive (they were kidnapped/adopted by Mormon families).   Historians have called this the worst event in Mormon history, which you might expect from historians. But the Mormons knew it at the time, too. Heck, they knew it in advance, which is why Lee and Haight worked so hard to get the Paiutes to participate in the initial attack. And while white Mormons were responsible for the brutal massacre, Paiute participation gave them the opening to claim Indian responsibility for ""yet another"" wagon train attack. (As John Unruh demonstrated so categorically, the actual ""Indian threat"" to overlanders was borderline nil, and our stereotypes today are the result of pop culture tropes and rumors already current in the 1840s).  The interesting thing, though, is that blaming the Paiutes didn't work quite as neatly as Haight and especially Lee might have hoped. So the Mormon leadership, desperate to avoid being implicated in triggering the slaughter, turned Mountain Meadows into a pinpoint-local event instead. They offered up Lee as the scapegoat--he was excommunicated in 1870 and *executed* in 1877. Well, America's gossip mill loves a good gory bad guy making a bad end, which quieted things on the ""back east"" and government ends. And it's not like the Utah government was raring to make ""the worst event in Mormon history"" a topic of major discussion.  Nicely illustrative of how the Massacre slid out of historical memory is the fate of its physical commemoration through memorials and historic markers. In 1859, with the massacre still a fresh memory *and* knowledge of white domination of its perpetration bleedingly fresh, U.S. military officials (!) set up a massive monument at Mountain Meadows. Brigham Young himself apparently oversaw its destruction just months later. The U.S. rebuilt it; the Mormons destroyed it again.  In 1932, with Utah now a nice state and the LDS Church itself not directly involved in government in the same way as the territory days, the state historic commission determined to build a marker. Except...they basically hid it behind rocks several miles from the road, so no one would *actually* see it. To make things even worse: Juanita Brooks' 1950 book *The Mountain Meadows Massacre*, the first scholarly investigation of the event which laid much of the blame at the feet of Young and the LDS hierarchy, triggered two reactions. First, quietly, the LDS church undid Lee's excommunication very posthumously, recognizing that the extent to which he had been scapegoated was wrong. Second, also quietly, the church *bought the land where the 1932 marker was*--and razed it.  And as James Loewen discovered in his investigations for *Lies Across America*, as late as 1990, the ""new, improved"" marker firmly in U.S. government control still stated:  * ""The company of emigrants...*was attacked*"" [passive voice] * the original monument ""was not maintained"" [interesting way to say *torn down*]  The Mountain Meadows Massacre is not a feel-good story on anyone's part. The emigrants--who are undeniably teh victims here!--have been built up in collective memory to look not so good (victim blaming is always the easy way out), the Mormons don't look good, the U.S. government doesn't even look all that good for giving the impression of invading a territory (bad PR, overwrought officials fleeing and stoking rumours/hatred in Washington, giving up after one blizzard). The massacre didn't fit pre-Unruh theories about horrible violent Indians; but the real story of Indian participation in the beginning plus being blamed for the later events doesn't particularly suit *any* political agendas in more recent decades. The Utah Expedition roots that helped spark the slaughter are a diversion from the ""popular sovereignty is about slavery"" narrative that drives what you might call the major plot line of U.S. political history leading up to the Civil War.  Historical memory is not inevitable: people control what does and doesn't get told, as well as how it gets told. With so much history out there, far more than anyone could ever hope to know--yes, agendas are going to drive what does and does get ""told"" and ""remembered"". And as the history of the Mountain Meadows Massacre's commemoration shows, in this case people on all sides had a much more vested interest in forgetting than remembering."
72506	0	a	"Mormon History! This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures! I'm going to assume that you are not Mormon, but if you are, please forgive me for explaining something you already know. If you look at current LDS sources for information about the early history of the LDS church you will find that it is all [correlated](http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Correlation_of_the_Church_Administration). This basically means that the Church has simplified and whitewashed its history into something more socially acceptable. Because of this it can be difficult for active members of the Church to find sources and information that they consider acceptable. This is also why sometimes Mormons (or non-Mormons) will hear about something in Mormon history and feel like they should have known about it, but didn't. The Utah War in general, and [Mountain Meadows Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Meadows_massacre) in specific are good examples.  The Utah War is a period where Brigham Young was using his influence to try to control many aspects of the Utah Territory. Keep in mind that when the Utah War started the Mormon Pioneers (Saints) had been in the Salt Lake Valley for about a decade, and Brigham Young had amassed a huge amount of power in that time. This all started with the Mormon Reformation which is a time when Brigham Young started pushing the Saints to follow the law of polygamy, and accept him as the leader of the Church, Territory, and Army (Nauvoo Legion). You can learn a lot about this time period by reading [Wife No. 19](https://www.amazon.com/Wife-No-Paperback-Eliza-Young/dp/184902832X) by Ann Eliza Young. She also discusses how Young had become a dictator in Utah Territory at that time, and how his desires were turned into action and violence within Utah.  So, what actually happened? The simple answer is ""not much"" but, as with much of history, things are more complicated than they might at first look. As I recall the trouble started when the [Willie-Martin Handcart Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_handcart_pioneers#1856:_Willie_and_Martin_handcart_companies) struck disaster in Wyoming in October 1856. In response to this tragedy the United States sent soldiers and investigators to Utah to try to figure out why such a disaster happened. While this might seem like a normal response, for Young it was an attack on him, his leadership, and his people. You can get an idea of how often he felt this way about any criticism by also reading the [Journal of Discourses](https://www.lds.org/topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng).   Young started to order the Saints to make the lives of Gentile soldiers (non-Mormons) difficult by doing things like spooking livestock, burning supply wagons, and harassing them. The Saints felt justified in doing this because of the persecution they had suffered in the past, and they wanted to stand up for themselves now. At this point things might have all blown over, if not for the death of [Parley P. Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parley_P._Pratt).  Pratt was murdered in Arkansas, while on a mission, by the jealous husband of a woman he had converted to Mormonism and wanted to take as a plural wife. Her husband found out, found Pratt and killed him. Sadly, at about the same time as Pratt's death a Pioneer company also from Arkansas set out for California. The Baker-Fancher party had nothing to do with the death of Pratt, but that was not the message the Saints received. By the time Baker-Fancher arrived in SLC there were many who believed that they were responsible for the death of a beloved Elder in the Church. The Saints refused to sells provisions to the group (or perhaps they were ordered not to), and the group moved south to Utah Valley and Provo where they were, again, unable to resupply. Finally they were told of a place further south where they could camp and try to regroup and figure out what to do to get across Death Valley and to California.  The Baker-Fancher party arrived in Mountain Meadows in early September 1857. They were the besieged by a group consisting mostly of Mormons dressed as Paiute Indians, although there may have been a few Paiute involved. After 3 days they were then massacred on September 11, 1857. Over 130 men, women, and children were killed, and only 18 children under the age of 8 were saved. Those children were raised for about a year by Mormon foster parents, some of whom had participated in the massacre, until they were rescued and returned to their families in Arkansas.  This was pretty much the end of the Utah War. The massacre stirred up too much attention, and with the polygamy also being pushed at the time there was pressure to back off and lie low for a while.  Sources I used (although much of this is from memory, so if I'm wrong I'll be happy to admit it):  [Wife No. 19 by Ann Eliza Young](https://www.amazon.com/Wife-No-Paperback-Eliza-Young/dp/184902832X) was originally published in 1875 and is a somewhat contemporary telling of the same events.  [The Journal of Discourses](https://www.lds.org/topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng) is a great source of information, but is very dense. I have not read all of them, and mostly only excerpts.

As an Ozarker by birth, I've got more than my fair share of Fanchers in my family tree and am related to more than a few of the members of the wagon train. It was a story I grew up with, and as expected, this bit:   > Second, they talked a massively violent rhetorical game against the Mormons. Not only were they going to give the Mormons trouble, not only were the incoming U.S. army troops going to give the Mormons even more trouble, but--the clincher--people in the Fancher party ""knew people"" who had oppressed the Mormons right out of Missouri, or maybe--some bragged--maybe they had been those people.  never quite made its way into the versions of the story my grandmother told me. Got any good reading suggestions where I could learn more? Thanks again!"

Since historical memory is our framework here, Bigley's section might interest you. He comes at it from the point of view of local collective memory in the later 19th century, the stories that Utah residents told about encountering the Baker-Fancher party in 1857. For example:  > [I]n 1882 Charles Wdlden provided a virtual catalog of the sins of the emigrants. He recalled seeing about twenty wagons drive into Lower Town and stop near the gristmill. Willden heard the men ''taking in a loud excited and boisterous manner profaning and threatening to do bodily harm and kill some of the citizens."" They boasted they had helped to kill Joseph Smith and other Mormons in Nauvoo and Missouri ""and that By G--- they would lull some more yet.""   or  > Seventeen-year-old Ed Parry was working on an irrigation  ditch when the Fancher wagons passed through Cedar. Parry told how two mounted men from the party approached a group of Mormons. ""[The man] riding a large gray mare seemed to be spokesman. He tried to get some of the crowd to buy him a gallon of whiskey, but none would do it. . . . [He] became abusive, swore at us all, said that he had the gun that killed Old Joe Smith, and that his company would go on to California and get an army and come back and wipe out every ---- ---- Mormon."""

How do these authors address the problem that comes from trying to use ""local collective memory"" on an issue as hotly contested as this one, especially in a region where a powerful and centralized authority like the Mormon Church holds such control? The idea of some settlers boasting about how they helped kill Joseph Smith seems like a weirdly specific claim to me. You say that the wagon party was from Arkansas. Why would so many say that they killed Joseph Smith in Missouri? "
72510	0	a	In short, no. And even things like the Generalplan Ost are less clear in what they were intended to be than people often assume but more on that below.  The thing about post-war plans is that they tend to be extremely tentative and uncertain until the point the war is actually over and even then they can change in some rather crucial details. Just as a quick look at the Allies: The first sketching of plans began in earnest in 1943 after first territories in North Africa had been liberated and many things weren't actively settled until Yalta and Potsdam in 1945 and even then substantive changes remained, f.ex. Yugoslavia becoming a socialist country. Plans for how the occupation of Germany would be handled concretely weren't finalized by the time the first German city, Aachen, was liberated by the Western Allies. So, post-war plans by the Nazis at any point in time are to be taken with a huge grain of salt and were subject to constant change.  Generalplan Ost is actually the best example of this. I've written about it before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6eqm99/why_is_the_generalplan_ost_considered_different/) and the crucial point is that the GPO was never fully implemented, only in very small parts. Because of rising, cost, effort, and the course of the war, planning for the GPO stopped and all started projects in connection to the GPO came to a halt after 1942, when the Nazis decided instead to use their available resources and manpower for the war and the Holocaust (which had been a crucial part of the GPO). What was implemented was very piecemeal and compared to the grand vision of the plans, comparatively small scale.  The same holds true for other plans, some of which never really made it out of the planning phase. Here the example of the Madagascar Plan is very fitting. I've written some more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5hkvcr/what_were_the_nazis_planning_to_do_with_the/) and with this example, the gist once again is that the so-called DIII proposal is genocidal in its intentions but only every existed in a very, very rough outline that never made it past a draft phase due to the fact that it wasn't feasible under existing conditions – Allied control of the seas – and that it was never fully endorsed by the entire political establishment of the Third Reich, which due to the political structure of Hitler's Germany had a tendency to be at each other's throat the entire time of its existence.  This last point is important because there only existed one agency charged with developing policy towards Africa: The NSDAP Office of Colonial Policy (Koloniapolitisches Amt der NSDAP – KPA). The KPA had been founded in 1934 and drawn together Nazis who had been involved in colonial policy during the period of Imperial Germany prior to WWI and charged with the mission of developing plans on how to bring former German colonies back under German control. It's head was Franz Ritter von Epp, an old Freikorps member and early Nationalsocialist.  Epp was rewarded this way for his continuing loyalty to the Nazi movement. A former soldier and successful Freikorps leader he might have been but a shrewd political operator he was not. Within the power structure of the Third Reich all his attempts to re-make the KPA as an official state agency rather than a mere party office failed and in 1938 the German Foreign Office won a significant political victory over Epp by taking charge of all efforts to win back the German colonies. Henceforth Epp and the KPA were charged with developing plans for Africa in general.  For the next two years, Epp and his fellow Nazi colonial administrators without a colonial empire sat around and dreamed up megalomaniac plans for how a new German colonial Empire in Africa would look like. Most of these plans however were either so bad or so unfeasible that they apparently never made it to the phase of being written down coherently and therefore there is little record of them whatsoever.  Only in 1940 with Axis success in North Africa did the KPA have its fifteen minutes of fame. What they essentially did was dig up old drafts from WWI Germany for what would happen after a German victory in Africa and slightly re-tooled them. Effectively, they planned for a large central African German colony encompassing the majority of British colonies in the area and containing Tanganjika, half of Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Nordrhodesia and the Kongo with South Africa as a German puppet state. attached to it. They drew up racial laws more modeled along Nazi lines for these territories that were closely oriented also on those in South Africa and Rhodesia. Their plan also included some presence by the SS.  However, this plan – and this must be emphasized – was really, really rudimentary and while the KPA did already start preparing future colonial administrators for their role, it lacks the detail that – say – even the GPO had. This is all laid down in a document that doesn't encompass more than a good 30 pages of typewriter script, which isn't all that much.  And Epp's fifteen minutes would be over soon anyways. Going on into 1941 and 1942 losses in North Africa squashed dreams of a Nazi colonial empire and in 1943 the KPA and all Nazi planning for Africa was officially ended by Hitler and Bormann with all resources going into planning for the East.  Epp's plan did include very harsh racial laws that certainly could be seen as a preparatory stage to genocide or in as much as South African and Rhodesian policy edge on forms of cultural and other genocide but it did not include such concrete measures like the GPO, the Hungerplan or the Holocaust. Like so many other things it was a Nazi fever dream fantasized up by people who saw themselves as the future white supremacist overlords over the world and who thought that they could colonize Africa on a 30 page memo.  Edit: There still is an interesting history to write about Nazi war criminals fleeing to Africa though as just a few crumbs of information I dug up for [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9b0q48/why_would_nazi_doctor_horst_schumann_receive/) reveal though.

72511	0	a	"This question is an excellent one, but it veers into notions of sociology a bit, so I apologize in advance if this answer is a bit narrow. I'll chip in with a brief summary of an outstanding historical investigation called 'The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction' by historian Linda Gordon.   In sum, Gordon makes a very good argument for this sort of watering down of racial ideals into simply ""white"" and ""other"" as a product of American western expansion in the Reconstruction period (late-19th century and very early 20th). Her book tells the story of a group of orphans who were sent west from New York City to Arizona in 1904. These orphans were taken in by a Catholic organization that housed, schooled, and fed what were classically thought of as street urchins that spanned any number of nationalities. These kids represented a mixed bag of Italian, Irish, Dutch, German, Russian, etc. heritages, and were the product of broken, disintegrated, or lost families in many cases.   This is where it gets interesting, though. In New York City, these kids were viewed as undesirable for any number of reasons, not the least of which because of their respective ""races."" In short, the Catholic charity that looked after these kids couldn't give them away (literally...nobody would take them). An idea was hatched to clean these kids up and send them west, where good, Catholic families that applied and were properly screened could adopt them. Out west, these kids could be a boon to families who had lost their kids in the journey west, or just due to the sometimes harsh conditions out there.   Gordon's book details a 1904 expedition of children sent to an Arizona mining town called Clifton/Morenci (the towns were combined) where a number of generous, charitable Mexican families went through the proper channels to apply for and adopt these kids for a number of entirely respectable reasons (because these families had lost kids of their own, because they saw it as their Christian duty, etc.). It is important to note that these kids weren't just given away willy-nilly: the families that adopted them went through the proper channels, as did the organization that saw to their relocation.   None of the white families in Clifton/Morenci had shown any interest in adopting these kids before the children arrived in town, but a very interesting thing happened once they did. When the white residents of the mining community saw these white kids get off the train and go to live with the Mexican families, they LOST. THEIR. MINDS. Something akin to a lynch mob formed that evening, and the white residents went house to house, armed, and took the white children out of the Mexican homes. At one point, this white mob held the priests and nuns responsible for the adoption placements at gunpoint, and demanded the names of all the families that had taken custody of these ""white"" children.   Sadly, the courts upheld this action as entirely legal and justifiable, since (according to the courts) these white adults were acting in the best interests of the children. Yep, the courts sided with an armed mob of kidnappers because it thought that Mexicans getting custody of white children was so offensive and dangerous an act, that armed abduction was necessary to rectify the situation.   Gordon uses this incident to illustrate just how flexible and malleable notions of race truly are, and to illustrate how these notions were bent and reformed in the United States at the turn of the 19th/20th century. In New York, these children had been Irish, German, Italian, etc. Once out west, where whiteness was threatened by Mexicans, Native Americans, or Chinese, these kids simply became ""white."" So one could, by extension, argue that in the United States, the default ""white"" category developed as a defense mechanism for European transplants who saw an opportunity to reframe the debate on race once they were out west, where one's country of origin mattered less than if one was not Mexican, Native, or Chinese. This is a simplification of both Gordon's work, and the discussion on ethnicity studies in American history, but beginning with 'The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction' and digging into Gordon's sources might be a good place to start if one is looking to do a deep-dive on this subject.    **EDIT** - I really appreciate the gold! There's been a lot of great follow-up answers here that more comprehensively outline the broader history of ethnicity studies in not just the U.S., but in Europe as well. For the people asking for more information about orphan trains, the legal ramifications of the 1904 incident, or ""whiteness"" in European culture, I'd recommend digging into Gordon's sources, or even just having a look at what u/FoucaultMeMichel wrote below. "
72512	0	a	The above answer is an excellent one, but it focuses on the modern notion of 'whiteness' as it appears in the 20th century. However, the concept of whiteness has been uniquely attached to the idea of America since it's inception.  In pre-colonial Europe the ideas of whiteness and blackness were fairly vague and so to an English person, someone from Spain might be considered black. However, through the process of colonisation, it can be argued that the idea of 'whiteness' was built at least partly in opposition to the idea of 'blackness', so that by the time of the writing of the American Constitution, it was possible for white Americans to have rights that were denied to the substantial black and native populations in America.  This argument can be seen in Gary B Nash's book 'Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America.' He argues that the institution of slavery required a leap of logic to categorise all Africans into a single group of inferior servile 'blacks'. In such an environment it then became possible for the other inhabitants of North America to be classified as either 'White' European or 'Red' natives.   It can also be argued that the concept of whiteness was created as a way of pacifying the growing lower classes that were developing in the North American colonies. If there was a strictly defined underclass of 'black' and 'red' savages, poor European migrants would be more likely to associate themselves with the ruling classes and so unlikely to band with the rest of the subjugated peoples in opposition. This process was probably not premeditated, but came about as a lot of historical processes do in a series of pragmatic decisions made by people at the time that caused society to drift in a certain direction.   He goes on to clarify that these distinctions were never as defined as they can sometimes be presented and the categories were actively created by the other races. So, groups of slaves of African descent who had few concrete connections to Africa built on the connecting aspects of their disparate societies such as food, music, dance and religion to help create a new notion of a black African American. In the same way, Native Americans unified in opposition to the invading whites. These boundaries were also blurred so there are stories of people crossing or subverting these categorisations throughout early American history.   It seems that later waves of immigration to America by Polish, German, Italian, Caribbean, Chinese and other people simply slotted into the system that was long established in culture and partially codified in law.   Edit: Removed a duplicated paragraph
72513	0	a	"This is a complex question, and there isn't really *one* way that non-Anglo Europeans became ""white"" in the United States. I am by no means an expert, but I can recommend two books that I've found quite helpful in thinking through this:  * Nell Irvin Painter, The History of White People (Norton: 2010)  * Matthew Fyre Jacobson,Whiteness of a Different Color: European Immigrants and the Alchemy of Race (Harvard UP: 1999)  I think there are a couple of important caveats to any discussion like this. First, there is a historical distinction between ""whiteness,"" the Caucasian ""race,"" and Anglo-American conceptions of what it meant to be of the American race. Skin color was not always the sole or even primary indicator of racial difference, although it has certainly come to be. To give you an example, in 1899 William Ripley published a book called *The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study* in which he collated huge troves of data from various European anthropologists into an overarching theory of biologically determined racial difference for the continent. He divided Europe into three racial types: the Teutonic, the Alpine, and the Mediterranean. And these three races were distributed across Europe more or less north to south (Teutonic in the north, Alpine in the middle, and Mediterranean in the south). The basis of this division was not due to culture, or skin color, or any of the markers we know today. The division was based on primarily on head shape (""the cephalic index""). [Here's a map of the index from *Races of Europe.*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Ripley_map_of_cephalic_index_in_Europe.png) Madison Grant, in his book *The Passing of the Great Race,* took Ripleys theory and made it fully normative, equating the Nordic (Teutonic) race with human excellence.   Nineteenth century racial theory typically grouped these European races into one larger racial category (Caucasoid), which was set apart from the Negroids (African) and Mongoloids (Asian). Polygenism was the theory, popular throughout the 19th century, that these three races were in fact not biologically related to one another. And noted scientists like Louis Aggasiz spread polygenic racial theory across the country on the lecture circuit. I mention this because it's important to realize that racial differentiation *within* the Caucasoid race was of an entirely different magnitude than the racial differentiation *between* Caucasoids, Negroids, and Mongoloids. And although thinkers like Grant would  magnify the racial differences within the larger Caucasian classification, that was peculiar to his style of eugenic theory, not all racial theory. The racial divisions within the caucasion race still exist today, but rather than ""racial difference"" we now talk about them as ""ethnic difference."" And although ethnicity is now largely understood to index culture, many people still describe ethnic difference in terms of biological difference (e.g., swarthy Italians).   I mention all of this to suggest that, although many scholars talk about X or Y group ""becoming"" white, whiteness was not necessarily a category that existed from the start and slowly accumulated a larger population. We can also think about whiteness subsuming other kinds of racial/ethnic difference--in other words, it's not that Germans in America became ""white,"" rather, their whiteness became their most defining feature.  Jacobson argues that ""the contending forces that have fashioned and refashioned whiteness in the United States across time . . . are capitalism (with its insatiable desire for cheap labor) and republicanism (with its imperative of responsible citizenship)"" (p. 13). To this list I would also add religious toleration, since anti-semitic and anti-catholic sentiments have often governed who was white. But that does not explain why whiteness replaced European racial divisions as a primary mechanism of making sense of social difference.   What most scholars mean when they talk about whiteness in American culture is the suturing of skin color to ""Anglo-American"" culture, which is also difficult to quantify. Elisabeth Kinsley, for example, talks about ""ethnic"" performances of Shakespeare in New York City between 1890 and 1910 as one path through which ethnic difference was reconciled with Anglo-American culture (Kinsley, ""This Island's Mine: Mapping the Borders of Shakespeare, Whiteness, and National Belonging in Manhattan's Ethnic Theaters, 1890-1910"" *Text and Performance Quarterly* 34 (2014): 52-71), and there are literally countless other ways in which this kind of cultural refashioning took shape.   But ""becoming Anglo"" doesn't tell the complete story either. Jacobson argues that three forces were particularly important in allowing whiteness to coalesce as a unified racial category: American imperialism, which ""conferred its benefits by a logic of pan-white supremacy,""; naturalization case law related to changes in immigration law in the 1920s; and civil rights politics ""[eclipsing] the lingering divisions among the white races as it pressed its agenda of racial justice defined by the binary logic of the Jim Crow south."" (201). He concedes that this list is far from exhaustive, which speaks to just how complex this question would be to answer, but he sees these three forces as crucial.  I would recommend reading his book to learn the specifics, because the arguments are complex and the textual archive he marshals is very deep. Painter's book tells a very similar story, although she has a more nuanced look at permutations within whiteness in the early part of the 19th century. Where Jacobson focuses heavily on policy, law, and science, Painter talks about the cultural currents that made whiteness what it is.   "

72515	0	a	"I would also suggest a paper by Lee and Bean, 2004, *""America's Changing Color Lines: Immigration, Race/Ethnicity, and Multiracial Identification""*, that goes right about the ongoing change in ""racial"" divide, from a white/non-white division to the ongoing black/non-black division.   Summing up in a very crude way - end of mass immigration from the european countries - incorporation of european migrants in the economic structure of the USA and their emulation of the ""white american"" (i.e. wasp) lifestyle - gradual disappearance of national differences among the european immigrants and the process of intentionally distancing themselves from black and mixed race people, **together with the lack of systemic and legal discrimination against them**, helped Italians, Irish, European jews etc. to ""cross the color line"" and achieve a ""white"" status.  A similar process according to the authors happened in more recent times concerning asian and south-american migrants, and it's still ongoing. I quote,  >The change in racial classification among ethnic groups from nonwhite to white or almost white vividly illustrates that race is a cultural rather than a biological category that has expanded over time to incorporate new immigrant groups. As Gerstle (1999, p. 289) explains, whiteness as a category ""has survived by stretching its boundaries to include the Irish, eastern and southern Europeans who had been deemed nonwhite. Contemporary evidence suggests that the boundaries are again being stretched as Latinos and Asians pursue whiteness much as the Irish, Italians, and Poles did before them.""  Edited: formatting"

72518	0	a	> So her story seems to me to be somewhat the opposite of what you described above - the attempt to make a non-white person as white as possible.  Instead of moving West, she was moved East.  This is not uncommon in places of European colonisation during the 19th and 20th centuries.  It happened in Australia too, under the government policy of 'Assimilation'. We call it the Stolen Generation. Mixed race Indigenous kids were taken from their families and raised by white settlers. They idea was that they could be trained to be like whites, and then they would marry other whites. After a few generations, their blackness would be totally diluted. We recognise now that it was part of an effort to effectively genocide the Indigenous people. Colonialism sucks, to say the least.   And sadly, to a large degree it worked. Most Indigenous people I know are white-passing. It shows the visible lasting impact of decades of institutionalised racism. Let alone the emotional and cultural impact.  The Stolen Generation one of the most shameful moments of Australia's national history. Our government recently apologised to the Indigenous community for it. It was the least they could do.

[Here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4j42ag/there_was_military_involvement_by_the_united/d33w2sx/) is an answer I wrote regarding the U.S. Army policy of exterminating the buffalo herds for the intended purpose of subjugating and essentially eradicating the Plains Indians.  >Like all arguments I've seen on this issue, the examples of ""intent"" come from individuals who were in no position to speak for policy of the entire nation, and *all come from the context of a current state of war.*  My apologies, but this is absolutely absurd. The quotes I provide from both the FAQ page and the linked comment in my denialism post are from the very people who were certainly in a position to speak for policy of the entire nation: senators, governors, military officials, and *one* quote from a president (there are many, many more quotes from presidents I can give you). These people are, supposedly, the democratically elected officials of the United States and if they don’t have the “position” to speak for policy of the nation, nobody does. What’s more, we can even see how *the public* supported these things. Along with a quote from a Californian newspaper that is cited among these materials, multiple works have been published over a very long period of time detailing the genocide(s) that occurred in California that were all state sanctioned, publically supported, and carried out in a systematic way. References to these materials are provided in the linked posts.  >By the criteria for classification used, an event must meet both the mental and physical criteria, yet the evidence for the latter was weak at best--certainly arguable.  In my opinion, you haven’t presented anything to counter my evidence. You’ve simply said “I don’t agree because your material is weak.” Well, where is your analysis of events? Where is your synthesis of accounts? Where are your citations and references? Lackadaisically stating the contrary doesn’t provide a sound basis for your counter claims.  >But presenting that assumption as a fact seems like a classic case of censoring discourse before the fact, and further using the term ""denier"" clearly threatens dissenting viewpoints with being lumped in with people who believe the Holocaust was a hoax--never happened at all; a far cry from questioning the *characterization* of events that all agree happened.  You are more than welcome to ask a question on the sub and (hopefully) receive an answer that doesn’t censor discourse “before the fact.” As an Indigenous person, I am fine with people feeling threatened with being lumped with those who deny the Holocaust – that was an implication of my posts, after all."

Turkish Officials don't deny that Ottoman military personnel killed Armenians; they dispute the amount (they claim 300 000, while the most commonly referred to number is 1.5 million) and the reasoning behind it.  Robertson cites the Turkish ""official"" numbers of Armenians living in Turkey at the time as a reason that 1.5 million Armenians couldn't have been killed: ""[Turkish] demographic studies prove that prior to World War I, fewer than 1.5 million Armenians lived in the entire Ottoman Empire. Thus, allegations that more than 1.5 million Armenians from eastern Anatolia died must be false.""  (It's noteworthy that Robertson counters this with evidence from the Armenian Church, who claim that 2.1 million Armenians were living in Anatolia at that time.)  On the intention, Article II of the United Nations *Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Genocide* outlines that, in order for a sanctioned killing to be classified as a genocide, there must be ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group..."". Turkish officials today claim that the killings were performed because Armenians ""rose up"" against the Ottoman government in support of Russia, hoping that in victory they would claim their independence. To support this, in 2007 Turkish counsellor Orhan Tung wrote in the New Statesman (an opinion that the government mirrors to this day) that ""credible evidence"" for the intention to commit genocide has never been concretely found. This is obviously disputed, because as opposed to the Holocaust or the Bosnian War, there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.  (Again, its worth noting that Armenian historian Ara Sarafian reported to Mediamax that *Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide*, which was published by the Gomidas Institute in April 2011, as a proper Ottoman government document showcasing this exact intent.)  tl;dr: The Turkish government doesn't belief that an Armenian *genocide* happened, but refer to it as politically motivated killings, because of the definition of ""genocide"" by the United Nations.  "
72521	0	a	"Okay, this is a hard question, because it is a very loaded one. You assume that current Turkish state does not see itself as the continuation of Ottoman Empire, but it does. I think an easier question to answer would be ""why and how Turkey denies the Armenian genocide"".   There are different levels of genocide denial in Turkey, I will explain some of them and source them.  1st level: ""There was no killings, therefore there was no genocide."" This is NOT the most popular version of the denial in Turkey. Most Turks accept that there were killings. Defenders of this version are commonly the Neo-Ottomanists in Turkey. Their argument is that Armenians were called as ""sadik millet"" or ""millet-i sadika"" (""loyal nation"") in the empire, then they betrayed Ottomans and sided with Russians. Started gangs and mass killed Turkish people and Ottomans had to exile them. This version of history totally dismisses all the evidence of mass killings, by using conspiracy theories. As an example of this theory you can look at an example, which defends that Armenian genocide was invented to slander Ottoman empire:  Ermeni Sorunu: Büyük Oyun (Armenian Problem: Grand Game) by Adem Suad  2nd level: According to this, there were mass killings on both sides, but this was not a genocide. This is by far the most commonly believed version in Turkey. They mix truth with conspiracy theories and say that accepting genocide will have serious consequences for Turkey so we should not do that. They describe Ottoman Empire at the time as weak, they say that as the empire could not protect its citizens, it had to use force against Armenians. As Armenian gangs terrorized Turkish villages, Turkish people started arming themselves and attacked Armenians for revenge and Ottoman Empire could not stop them.   There are many different versions but they are all around denying responsibility in some manner. They say that for it to be counted as genocide, it has to be systematic, government has to round up all Armenians and kill all of them. As Ottoman Empire exiled the Armenians and some of them died on the road due to climate, starving etc. it is not a genocide. Founder of Turkey Mustafa Kemal Ataturk himself described the events by using the word ""fecaat"" (""disaster""). But he would not see it as a genocide as well. The defenders of this theory overlook events where government killed people just because they were Armenians as particular mistakes. They say that ""there is no written general plans of genocide"".  Some examples of Turkish historians, politicians and generals defending this theory:  Sürgünden Soykırıma: Ermeni İddaları (""From Exile to Genocide: Armenian Claims) by Yusuf Halaçoğlu (historian)  Ermeni Suçlamaları ve Gerçekler (""Armenian Accusations and Truths"") by İlker Başbuğ (ex army chief of Turkey)  Ermeni Sorununda Strateji ve Siyaset (Strategy and Politics in Armenian Problem) by Doğu Perinçek (far-right politician)  3rd level: It was a genocide, but it was committed by the Kurds. This is a last resort defense and has some truth to it, but again only partly. Ottoman Empire armed Muslim Kurds against Christians during 1890-1908, they are named as Hamidiye corps. After 1908, Ottoman Empire continued to support Kurdish aşirets (tribes? clans?) against Christians, especially Armenians. So some people claim that genocide happened, but it was the Kurds. Again, dismissing how Armenians in other parts of the empire were killed as well.  Source:  Hamidiye Alayları Ağrı Kürt Direnişi Ve Zilan Katliamı (""Hamidiye Corps, Agri Kurdish Resistance and Zilan Massacre"") by Kemal Süphandağ.   All of these are very controversial. Especially in Turkey. But I hope I gave you some idea at least. Sorry if I made mistakes, English is not my native language.  Edit: There are also many other versions that I did not list. For example some people claim that it was the will of Germany and not the Ottoman Empire. A source for that:  Ermeni Tehcirinde Almanya Etkisi (""German Influence at Armenian Exile"") by Bülent Keçik"
72522	0	a	>  there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.  It is worth mentioning that article II of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* has recently been legally interpreted and case law produced by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda:   That because of its nature, genocidal intent is not usually susceptible to direct proof and thus in the absence of explicit, direct proof, genocidal intent may therefore be inferred from relevant facts and circumstances.   That the specific genocidal intent may be inferred from certain facts, including but not limited to the general context of the perpetration of other culpable acts systematically directed against that same group, whether these acts were committed by the same offender or by others, the scale of atrocities committed, their general nature, the fact that the victims were deliberately and systematically chosen on account of their membership of a particular group, the political doctrine which gave rise to the acts referred to, the repetition of destructive and discriminatory acts, the perpetration of acts which violate the very foundation of the group or considered as such by their perpetrators, the physical targeting of the group or of their property, the use of derogatory language toward members of the targeted group, the methodical way of planning, the systematic manner of killing, the number of group members affected, the relative proportionate scale of the actual or attempted destruction of a group and that genocidal intent need not be formed prior to the commission of genocidal acts, but must be present when committed.  > denial of the Armenian Genocide lies in the motives for the killings.  Also worth mentioning that the same courts have interpreted that intent is different from motive. That motive is not an element of genocide and that other motives do not preclude genocidal intent. Whatever may be the motive for the crime (land expropriation, national security, territorial integrity, etc.), if the perpetrators commit acts intended to destroy a group, even part of a group, it is genocide.

In my day to day I fight with my local jurisdiction to ensure accurate numbers of people, especially marginalized people, are reported on various policy documents, including the census. That a census should report a particular figure is hardly proof if the census takers held a particular religious, political, or ethnic animosity toward the group they are supposed to count.

These, in turn, drew on actual folk traditions, although one must use a great deal of caution to see them as accurately capturing contemporary folklore.   One of the more important deviations that Tolkien imposed on the world of his creation was the idea of good and evil, which was largely absent from Northern European folk tradition. The dichotomy was a Church-based importation, and the folk were not quick to embrace it. Tolkien, perhaps because he was a committed Catholic but perhaps also for the facility of his concept of plot and literature, embraced the good-versus-evil approach to his world, and this required some ""tweaking"" of the legendary traditions that served as his inspiration.  Although Icelandic sources include an odd reference to light and dark elves, there is no clear manifestation of such a concept in pre-modern Scandinavian, Icelandic, or British and Irish tradition. Nevertheless, Tolkien - drawing on this or simply setting off on his own - created a dichotomy where his elves were good and their counterpart, the orcs, played the role that one might imagine could have been assumed by ""dark elves."" In reality, folk traditions regarded all supernatural beings a dangerous even though most were neither good nor evil. They were to be treated with caution and respect, and they were to be avoided if at all possible.  Tolkien's dwarves are more at home in medieval primary literature than they are in pre-modern folk tradition. There are entities that seem to fall into that line (living within mountains, focusing on smithing, and various other attributes), but with dwarves we see the clearest, exclusive use of medieval sources."
72528	0	a	"That's a really interesting answer, thank you.  I'd like to add, though, that Tolkien's elves cannot really be said to be ""good"", though they do seem to possess an inherent nobility or ""high"" nature.   They are often depicted as capricious, jealous, impulsive, meddlesome, short-sighted, greedy, vengeful, wrathful and lustful. There are numerous instances in *The Silmarillion* alone.  In addition, there is one elf, [Eol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6l), who is explicitly referred to as a Dark Elf. In Tolkien's mythology, elves who never journeyed West and looked on the lights of Valinor were often considered ""lesser."""

While on the topic of light and dark elves, it's worth noting that Tolkien also wrote about a specific division within elves between light/high elves, who saw the light of the two trees in valinor, and dark elves, who never did.  The dark elves weren't necessarily evil, they just didn't make the journey, for lots of different reasons, before it was too late.  "

The Nibelungenlied - and its Icelandic echo, the Volsunga Saga - also influenced Tolkien, but for the supernatural beings in OP's question, the Eddas are the best medieval sources for Tolkien's purposes.
72534	0	a	"I think that came out of the internal logic of Tolkien's fictional world, rather than being inspired by mythology. The inspiration for the orcs were the goblins, demons and evil spirits of folklore and particularly the *orcneas* that are mentioned in Beowulf. It's not clear what *orcneas* actually referred to in Old English, but as a philologist Tolkien often took his inspiration from words alone, and then came up with fictional constructs that he felt fit them.  Originally Tolkien simply stated that orcs—along with balrogs and dragons—were created by the supreme evil force in his stories, Melkor/Morgoth. Towards the end of his life, after the publication of the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien spent many years trying to rationalise the metaphysics of his fictional universe and, critically, make it consistent with his views on real-world theology and metaphysics. One of the things that did not sit well with him was the idea that an entity like Melkor would have been able to create life of his own, independent of his universe's supreme creator deity, Eru. So he retroactively made dragons and balrogs manifestations of lesser divine spirits (*maiar* – like Gandalf and the other wizards in LotR) that had fallen in with Melkor when he rebelled against Eru. Orcs were far too numerous and mundane to be explained the same way, so Tolkien landed on the explanation that they were elves that were corrupted by Melkor early in the history of the Middle-Earth. He was never entirely comfortable with this explanation, though, and came up with a number alternatives: that they were corrupted men; a mix of corrupted elves, men and maiar lieutenants; non-sentient beasts that imitated elves and men; or the descendants of lesser maiar who were the original orcs. Tolkien never settled on one explanation before his death.   Source: Tolkien, Christopher. 1993. ""Myths Transformed"". In *Morgoth's Ring*. History of Middle-Earth Vol. X."
72535	0	a	"Just so we're clear in advance: [this is Rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Kennedy#/media/File:Rosemary_Kennedy_at_Court.jpg), making her debut at the English royal court.  In point of fact, none of the immediate Kennedy family expressed public remorse/criticism for inflicting the lobotomy on Rosemary--at least not directly. Now, whether they all believed it was the *right* thing to do, whether they believed it was the *utilitarian* thing to do, and whether they *indirectly* expressed a sense of failure or anger--that is, shall we say, a rather nebulous topic in biographies of the various Kennedys.  One camp, headlined subtly by Doris Kearns Goodwin and like a sledgehammer by Laurence Leamer at the two poles of the spectrum, sees in Joseph's actions after the 1941 ""surgery"" a man seeking solace (Goodwin) or who understood he had committed a major sin (Leamer). Joseph initially placed Rosemary at a rehab/care facility called Craig House that had an excellent reputation and charged the fees to back it up. Joseph's biographer (and actual professional historian) David Nasaw shows on the basis of letters sent to family members that Joseph most likely visited Rosemary several times over the course of the 1940s, although it became horribly clear she would regain any more of what had been wrenched away from her than some motor skills. Joseph's words to his family are noncomittal--""looks very well"" ""feeling quite well."" In 1949, probably owning up to the long-term prognosis, he arranged a special place for her at an institution/""school"" in Wisconsin run by Franciscan Colettine nuns. As in, he gave *buckets* of money to the place for special accommodations for her.   Of course, while Joseph was doing all of this, he was keeping his family away from visiting Rosemary themselves, and misleading them about the shockingly awful lobotomy results. Whether he was trying to insulate himself from his wife Rose's wrath, or protect his family from seeing what he'd done, OR protect his family from seeing that what he perceived as a last-ditch attempt to help her had still failed, is left to question.  For his part, Nasaw, whose take is generally considered among the most equitable, refuses to make a judgment call on whether Joseph believed he had done the wrong thing. But although he won't go as far to paint Joseph as a father with at least *some* sorrowful feelings for his daughter as Goodwin, she is much more brutal about the effect this had on Rose. She tells the story of Rose asking her friends over and over, ""Why didn't you tell me?"" only for her friends to say, ""we didn't know either."" In her memoirs, she wrote:  > The operation eliminated the violence and the convulsive seizures, but it also had the effect of leaving Rosemary permanently incapacitated. She lost everything that had been gained during the years by her own gallant efforts and by our loving efforts for her. She had no possibility of ever being able to function in a viable way in the world at large.  I'm not sure how this is not generally accounted a direct attack on Joseph's decision, but it does not seem to be? But then, this may be a pattern. There is one letter where Joseph comments more extensively on Rosemary's existence in the world, rather than breezy mentions of doing well. In 1958, he wrote to the nuns of St. Coletta's expressing his deep gratitude for their ""persevering kindness"" towards Rosemary. And pretty much every writer quotes the same lines:  > I am still very grateful for your help. After all, the solution to Rosemary's problem has been a major factor in the ability of all the Kennedys to go about their life's work and to try to do it as well as they can.  Nasaw offers zero commentary; Goodwin suggests he is expressing sorrow for the outcome, and maybe or maybe not the decision. Disability rights advocates, on the other hand, have pointedly asked, ""Is Rosemary not 'all the Kennedys'?"" And in Joseph's words, they find him saying that isolating Rosemary in Wisconsin, away from the world's knowledge and from her own family, was the only way that the rest of them could be successful. That is to say: people with cognitive disabilities are a problem to be solved, and to be solved by exclusion.  Of course, the rest of the Kennedys went on to champion mental health services and services for people with cognitive disabilities on the national and even international scale. Rose Kennedy was orchestrating donations for child neurology research through the Kennedy Foundation into the 2000s--and, for whatever bitterness she held, ensuring that things with a name attached would memorialize Joseph as well as herself. Jack signed a series of mental health services bills into law; while they ultimately resulted in massively inadequate care for a lot of people when the requires facilities were never built (a failure of money and a crime of NIMBYism), Senator Daniel Moynihan suggested that Jack would have *flipped tables* in the White House if he thought people like his sister would not be taken care of. Eunice Kennedy Shriver's activism in creating an arena for social life and growth in the Special Olympics I've discussed elsewhere in the thread. Ted Kennedy was pushing for mental health insurance coverage parity until the end of his life. And people generally agree that the Kennedys did a lot to raise awareness of the actual, real existence of people with cognitive disabilities and mental health disorders--and more to the point, of starting to crack the stigma on talking about them in the first place.  They shouldn't get all the credit. The 1950s saw mothers (and some fathers, but mostly mothers) of children with Down's syndrome banding together in parents' groups--ARC is founded in 1951--and did a lot to cast off the idea that a diagnosis of developmental disability was *the absolute end* for the togetherness of the family. On the other hand, you can't argue with the impact of the visibility--and pocketbooks--of the Kennedys.  I'm not a cynic who sees the other Kennedys ""using"" Rosemary as a platform, or rather, of ""taking advantage"" of her. Nevertheless, I have to wonder why--in the face of all the crusading--Rosemary herself was never allowed a presence. The lobotomy destroyed the person she had been...but there are all kind of people at all levels of cognitive ability in America. So I think it's a real question that both historians assessing the situation and disability rights advocates have to ask: were they (and hence, people in a similar situation) keeping Rosemary out of sight because of guilt, shame, unwillingness to criticize the family patriarch? Or did they conclude based on what they knew of Rosemary's own thoughts and hopes, rather than their own, what *she* would have preferred...had she only been able to voice them herself?

Kennedy, 1917-1963* * Ian Dowbiggin, *Quest for Mental Health: A Tale of Science, Medicine, Scandal, Sorrow, and Mass Society* * Doris Kearns Goodwin, *The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys* * Laurence Leamer, *The Kennedy Men* * David Wright, *Downs: The History of a Disability* (note that Rosemary Kennedy did not have Down's syndrome, but he discusses her in the context of her siblings' activism)"

72537	0	a	"As the singer-songwriter [Tom Waits said in an interview on *America2Night* in May 1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xFqBWyNySk), when asked if he liked to drink: ""I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."" By 1978, when Waits said these words, the horror of the frontal lobotomy was obvious, but it took doctors some time to realise how damaging the frontal lobotomy was. So it would have likely taken Joe Kennedy some time to realise that the procedure he had put Rosemary through was as damaging as it actually was.  In the 1940s, neuroscience was very much in its infancy compared to today, and the nature of the brain and the location of particular faculties of the brain was still often up for debate. A famous much-studied case of memory loss, H.M., became that way because a neurosurgeon in 1953 excised a part of the brain that was involved in making new memories, in the belief it would help cure H.M.'s epilepsy (which it indeed seems to have partially helped). It was only after careful study of cases like H.M. that neuroscientists began to understand more about how the brain worked (along with the rise of, especially fMRI research in the last 20-30 years); the neurosurgeon had no idea his incisions would have the effect of causing anterograde amnesia. But thanks to intensive study of H.M., we do now. The medical belief at the time was that intelligence worked via the integration of brain fibers from multiple cortical areas. Thus, if a part of the brain was damaged, the removal of brain areas that were damaged might actually *improve* mental function rather than severely slow it down, because it was no longer getting in the way of the rest of the brain doing its work.  So, in the 1940s, it seemed perfectly reasonable to many doctors that the frontal lobotomy might be profitably excised from a range of problematic patients - nobody knew what it was for, and patients afterwards seemed much less upset. Indeed, Antonio Egas Moriz, who pioneered the frontal lobotomy, won a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1949 for his efforts (clearly denoting that doctors had found it a godsend).  Obviously, however, this belief was wrong. In 1941, when Rosemary Kennedy underwent the procedure, it was still a relatively new procedure in America. In 1942, however, Freeman and Watts published a textbook, *Psychosurgery*, which contributed to the popularity of the lobotomy; the same year, the *Journal of the American Medical Association* published an editorial asserting that lobotomy was preferable in situations were remission was remote. In the popular magazine *Coronet* in 1942 was an article titled 'Psychsurgery Cured Me', with a tag line about how it was an ""inspiring story of a nervous wreck, miraculously restored to normal life and happiness by a surgeon's knife"". In 1941, in the *Saturday Evening Post*, an article about the procedure suggested that ""from problems to their families and nuisances to themselves, [many] have been transformed into useful members of society. A world that once seemed the abode of misery, cruelty and hate is now radiant with sunshine and kindness to them."" So, all things in all, Joe Kennedy was simply following a promising new medical procedure that doctors were advising; it would not have been initially clear in 1942 that Rosemary's condition after the surgery was a problem.  Some doctors *had* argued against the lobotomy from the start as being too radical and/or a violation of the Hippocratic Oath, but they clearly didn't have enough heft to have it banned. The first particularly prominent public criticism of the lobotomy came in published articles in *Time* and *Life* magazine about the procedures in 1946, based on criticism from (Freudian-influenced) psychiatrists who believed that the neurosurgeons didn't understand the mind. But psychiatrists speaking Freudian gobbledygook were easy enough to ignore. So between 1941 and 1947, at least 1725 lobotomies were performed, it being seen as a proper and useful medical procedure. Thus the Nobel Prize for Egas Moniz in 1949.  It was instead in the early 1950s - ironically, as the lobotomy became much more popular thanks to the hoopla around the Nobel Prize - when it became clear that the lobotomy was particularly troublesome. The National Institute of Mental Health in the USA held several conferences around 1949-1951 which suggested that lobotomies were being carried out much too carelessly, and that criteria for outcomes were not specific enough (e.g., it was hard to tell whether there was improvement as a result of lobotomies because nobody was really looking properly). This disquiet eventually resulted in a landmark 1958 study by AA Robin, which carefully measured things, and convincingly found that lobotomies did not improve outcome. But also, before 1958, neuroscientific knowledge had progressed to the point where it was realised that the typical prefrontal lobotomy as practiced by most psychosurgeons was also excising the 'visceral brain' (including the hypothalamus), and not just the prefrontal lobes (and that Freeman and Watts were nowhere near sufficiently careful enough in their excisions, to the extent that they weren't accounting for differences in brain size).  Public opinion against the frontal lobotomy turned decisively in 1949, when a scientific meeting where harsh words were said about the frontal lobotomy was reported upon in *Newsweek* and the *New York Times* In 1950-1951, articles in the *Scientific American* and the *Saturday Evening Post* struck an ambivalent tone about the procedures. In 1953, a *New York Times* article titled ""Lobotomy Banned in Soviet As Cruel"", concluded that 'the procedure is contrary to the principles of humanity', and that 'through lobotomy, an insane person is changed into an idiot'.   Despite this criticism (and perhaps because of the Nobel Prize), many neurosurgeons continued to perform lobotomies in the early 1950s; it was only with the introduction of chlorpromazine to treat schizophrenia in 1954 that lobotomies started to recede in prominence. But Freeman was still advocating the procedure in public as late as 1958 and still performing them as late as 1967.  So while Joe Kennedy may or may not have been horrified by what had happened to Rosemary Kennedy after the frontal lobotomy, frontal lobotomies were still a common surgery a decade after her operation, and many doctors would still have been advising concerned parents that a frontal option was a better option than the alternative.  It should still be pointed out that doctors still remove important parts of the frontal cortex in specific situations, to try and alleviate issues for patients. For example, in severe cases of epilepsy, parts of the brain that seem to precipitate the seizures are sometimes removed, and this can include parts of the prefrontal lobe in some cases; in my other life as a music psychologist rather than a Reddit historian, I reviewed at a bunch of research that had been done on people who have had (parts of) their temporal lobes excised (edit: as /u/sunagainstgold points out, these are lobectomies, not lobotomies, and for the unfamiliar, the temporal lobe is a different part of the brain to the prefrontal lobe), because that surgery had a severe effect on their ability to understand music (note: yes, that's fascinating, but no, you'll have to ask about that in another subreddit).   Sources:  * Kucharski (1984). 'History of Frontal Lobotomy in the United States, 1935-1955', in the journal *Neurosurgery*.  * Diefenbach, Diefenbach, Baumeister, and West (1999).

72538	0	a	Jack Kennedy (most biographers say Jack, so let's go with that) was a major supporter of community mental health initiatives, but it was not because of Rosemary Kennedy's experience in state institutions.  Until the horrific results of the lobotomy at age 21, she had been raised at home in the U.S. and abroad by her family, instructed by private tutors when she could no longer keep up in school. After the surgery, her father sequestered her at a convent in Wisconsin called St. Coletta's. According to letters they wrote, both Joseph and, once she visited in 1961, Rose thought the care the nuns took of their daughter was exceptional.  However.  Inspired, or perhaps better *provoked* by her sister's experience, *Eunice* Kennedy embarked on a tour of both state-run and privately-owned institutions over the course of the 1950s. She later wrote:  > The conditions in those days were terrible...there was no special education, no physical activity and certainly no opportunity to play sports. My visits left an indelible mark for life--I knew I had found an area of enormous need where I could focus my life’s work and energy.  Some of Eunice's fondest and proudest memories of her sister were always her mastery of several formal dances and her ability to play tennis, hence the emphasis in her recollection there. And that certainly shaped for *her* lifelong activism and advocacy for people with cognitive disabilities--she organized numerous sports camps and helped found the Special Olympics in 1968.
72539	0	a	What was her situation before the lobotomy? I've heard she may have had a learning disability,  but maybe she was just below average in a family of ambitious, above average people?
72540	0	a	The Kennedys are the Kennedys, so money could open doors to whatever testing they wanted. Rose wrote that she took Rosemary to multiple specialists, the best specialists she could find, doctors at Harvard, and so forth. The general agreement was that, as a child, Rosemary was mildly retarded. With immense effort on her part and support from her parents and siblings to provide the right tools for her, she attained upper-level elementary school abilities in reading and math. She also apparently had plenty of social graces and was in general a sweet and kind person. Even writers hostile to various Kennedys have suggested that her family shielded her from realizing how far behind her siblings she would inevitably end up.  All of that is very well attested--and it's not why Joseph sought the lobotomy for his daughter. About a year and a half before the devastating surgery, Rosemary had returned to the US from London, and apparently started to gradually fall apart mentally. I've read some places that the first signs of trouble had appeared when she was still in London--verbal altercations and fistfights; odd gaps in the logic and even actual writing of letters she sent. There may also have been a further deterioration in her cognitive skills, which would make sense if she was also newly having uncontrolled seizures as well. In other words, Joseph did not suddenly decide on some new experimental, dangerous procedure for his daughter on a whim. There were very real and new worries, so one can at least sympathize with the *search* for alternatives.  This is the part of Doris Goodwin's book (*The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys*) that, I believe, has helped earn her praise for how she dealt with Rosemary from other Kennedy-orbit biographers and scholars like Dallek. In case you're interested in reading a little more.
72541	0	a	"In brief, one can approach this question down in a few ways:  **Were they likely to be considered literal war crimes and open to prosecution at the time?** No, because the Allies came up with the definitions and applications of the ideas of war crimes, and exempted themselves very deliberately from prosecution. Were they hypocritical? It was argued by some of those under prosecution for war crimes, and even by some who were more neutral, that there were obvious hypocrisies (aside from the US and UK participating in mass bombing of civilians, you also have things like the Soviet lootings and rapes, as well as mass executions at Katyn, and so on), and that this devalued the usefulness of ""war crimes"" as a category if it basically only applied to losers in war.   **Were they radically morally different from other Allied activities?** It depends on how you want to parse out the morality, but they are alike in many ways (though not all) to the use of napalm (firebombing) against Japanese and, to a lesser but still significant extent, German cities. In these attacks, mass areas were targeted, with deliberate goals of destroying civilian housing and infrastructure, and with the knowledge that many civilians would die. This was especially true of the infamous raids against Tokyo and its environs in March 1945, which killed as many people as the atomic bombings did. One could argue, if one wanted, that the atomic bombs were slightly worse from this perspective: they were considerably more deadly for the area of target destroyed, especially compared to later firebombings, because of their surprise and speed of attack (with firebombings, there are ways to detect the attack ahead of time and flee, and also some measure of defense possible in terms of firefighting and fire breaks; these were not the case with the atomic bombings). The Allies also did warn, in way both vague and specific, about firebombing attacks; they did not warn (contrary to Internet myths) about the atomic bombing attacks. Is this splitting hairs? It doesn't really matter for this analysis: if you are saying that the atomic bombs were ""just as bad or maybe worse"" than the firebombings, you probably already are concluding that the indiscriminate targeting of civilians was some measure of ""business as usual,"" which does _not_ in any way get you off the hook for questions about ""war crimes"" (in fact, it is even worse — saying you _regularly_ committed similar offenses does not make them less heinous).  **Did people at the time worry about the morality of these kinds of attacks?** Yes, both inside and outside the US government. There were many people in and out of the US who condemned the attacks, or at least questioned the city-targeting aspects of them. Within the US, even those who plotted to use the atomic bombs saw them as being imbued with special moral hazards, and thought that indiscriminate targeting of cities was potentially not aligned with stated US values. Scientists on the project (at the University of Chicago) warned that targeting cities with the first bombs would lead the world down a very dark path, and could not be justified (see the Franck Report). At higher levels, even the US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, warned Truman that indiscriminate firebombing might allow the US to exceed the reputation of the Nazis for atrocities, and worked (in a way that one might or might not judge meaningful) to keep the city of Kyoto off the target list partially as a means of mitigating the moral issues. In a forthcoming paper, I have argued that I think Truman himself saw the bomb in these terms, and that in agreeing with Stimson that Hiroshima, not Kyoto, should be the first target of the atomic bombings, he was (incorrectly) under the impression that the bomb would be first used on a ""purely military target"" (as he put it) and not a city. He did not, I argue, learn Hiroshima was in fact a city (and that 90% of the casualties were civilian) until August 8, 1945, as an aside. All of which is to say, if someone says to you, ""nobody had moral issues with this at the time,"" they are wrong. Plenty of people, _including the people who ordered the atomic bombs be dropped_, recognized that this kind of bombing _did_ present moral hazards, though of course they did not think they were considering them ""war crimes."" But it opens the door to us considering them as moral hazards without being accused of being ahistorical.  **Did the atomic bombings violate any treaties the US had signed _at the time_?** No. The US had not signed many treaties on the laws of war at the time, and the ones it did sign did not really come into play. One can make a very stretching argument that the atomic bombings might fall under the prohibition of the use of poisonous gases, but it is a stretch (they did not create significant contamination; the deaths were primarily from fire and blast effects).   **Would the atomic bombings of Japan count as war crimes if they were done _today_?** The US has very lengthy guidelines for how it interprets the Geneva Conventions and the Law of War today, and how nuclear weapons play into that. In principle such an attack plan — target the center of a city for the purpose of destroying the city and terrorizing a country into surrender — would probably _not_ be considered a justifiable reason to use nuclear force, as it would violate the principles of discrimination (it would unduly target non-combatants) and likely proportionality (it is overkill for the goals it is trying to accomplish). This does not mean that you could not come up with a rationale for doing the same thing (e.g., you could re-frame the justification around military necessity, the limitation of conventional forces to do the same job, a focus on the military and industrial facilities in the target zone, etc.), but the rationale used _at the time_, which is to say, the destruction of a civilian population for the purpose of convincing Japan to surrender, would probably not pass the legal scrutiny of the JAGs. But these kinds of questions are notoriously difficult to parse in the abstract, so who really knows. Current US plans for the employment of nuclear weapons are structured around the ideas of discrimination, necessity, and proportionality, and so instead of saying, ""put a huge explosion in the city center"" they are about how you would destroy some specific military capability in the city. Is that a moral difference? This is a question for another day. But again, I suspect the US would _not_ find it easy to justify the attacks under the _present_ Geneva Convention it has signed to (some years after World War II) which is much more explicit about the illegality of targeting cities in this way. But we should also note, while we are on the subject, that the US has found the means to justify a lot of other kinds of city bombing after WWII, which makes me a wary about concluding that the lawyers could not find a way to justify it. They are clever, after all.   In short: by modern standards they would probably not be permissible actions. By the standards of the time, they ride the line of what the Allies considered permissible _when they were doing them_, though this was seen by many as hypocritical. In any event, the fact that they were credited with ending the war (whether they did or not is a hot topic of scholarly debate), and the fact that the Allies created the war crimes tribunal, meant that not only were there no negative consequences for those who were involved in the bombings, but in fact almost all of those who were involved saw their careers flourish as a result of them.

72546	0	a	"Can you elaborate on the statement about the Allies' warning of the cities being an ""internet myth""? I have seen, in museums, some of the fliers they were supposed to have air dropped over various Japanese cities warning the citizens to evacuate. As I recall, they dropped these fliers on several cities (not just Hiroshima and Nagasaki), but did drop them before the bombings.  EDIT: I believe the leaflet I saw was one of the ""LeMay"" leaflets mentioned in the below link. It was presented in the exhibit (I apologize, but do not remember which museum) pretty much as described in that article - vague unspecific warnings, nonetheless telling people to evacuate a larger list of cities that included Hiroshima and Nagasaki. http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/04/26/a-day-too-late/  PS: I'm not attempting to make any kind of moral case regarding the bombing here, just thought it was odd to refer to the warning leaflets as an ""internet myth"" when there is definitely some evidence for their existence (if not 100% definitive on the specifics of when/where exactly they were dropped). "
72547	0	a	> He did not, I argue, learn Hiroshima was in fact a city (and that 90% of the casualties were civilian) until August 8, 1945  Wait, so you are telling me the President of the United States, Truman, did not know Hiroshima was a city? 
72548	0	a	I don't know of any cases of the WWII allies being tried under international law. There have been domestic court martial trials for individuals (e.g. Lt. William Calley and the My Lai Massacre).   It is a cynical thing to say, but in general it is the losers of wars that end up in the docket at the Hague (or Nuremberg), not the winners. The US is in particular very wary about being bound by the judgment of international law (they do not recognize the authority of the International Court of Justice and have a very complicated relationship with the International Criminal Court), in part because it will not submit it actions to international scrutiny or approval. If that makes you wonder about the utility of things like the Geneva Conventions, you would not be the first, but perhaps we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good — it is probably better to have norms that are occasionally broken than not to have them at all.
72549	0	a	There were leaflets relating to firebombing attacks. There were no leaflets relating to atomic bombing attacks. The latter is a myth. (I wrote the blog post you link to.) Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not, so far as I can tell, specifically warned about being conventional bombing targets, either (they did not get LeMay leaflets dropped on them, nor were their names featured on the LeMay leaflets).
72550	0	a	"The funny thing is, when I've given this thesis as a talk (I've been working on it for several years), prior to 2016 I would always get one person in the audience who would say, ""are you telling me that you think it is possible that the President of the United States could be so out of the loop on something of this magnitude?"" But after November 2016, that question more or less has gone away — people find it easier _for some reason_ to believe that the President is just a person, and not some kind of omnipotent being.  But I digress: yes, that is what I am saying. One might ask, how could this be? Several answers present themselves: 1. it was not a household name of a city in the US at the time (I have done many searches through historical newspapers — it was not one of the city names that featured in practically any national news coverage prior to August 6, 1945), 2. Truman was the last US President to lack a college education (not a sin, but still), 3. Truman had no experience in foreign affairs prior to FDR's death (and FDR did not give him any insights into his own thinking, which probably was a sin), 4. Truman went through all of these discussions while at the Potsdam Conference, where he was (in his own telling of it) totally overwhelmed with the competition for his attention from the many fateful issues that were in front of him, 5. by the account of those who worked close to him, he was not by nature inquisitive or prone to micromanagement or asking close questions, and, most importantly, 6. it was presented to him as a major military base and target by his Secretary of War, in the only conversations he would have about the targeting questions.  Given all of the above, and Truman's own fallibility (which he himself would have vouched for), I think it is entirely plausible that he was confused as to the nature of what was being targeted for the first use of the atomic bomb (which, as an aside, was the only thing he concerned himself with — you may be even more surprised to hear that I don't think Truman even knew that another one was going to follow on its heels within a few days, so fixated was he and everyone else at Potsdam on the _first_ use of the bomb)."
72551	0	a	"> I’m just wondering where you stand on the moral aspect of it in terms of reduction of casualties overall.  I think it's tricky. I think in order to believe that it reduced casualties, you have to believe three things:  1) The bombs ended the war. Historians debate this vehemently. It is not clear they did. It may seem ""obvious"" to you, but that probably is because you haven't looked deeply into the final days of the war. Hasegawa's _Racing the Enemy_ is a provocative, deep look into these last days. He argues that the bombs by themselves did not end the war — that the Soviet invasion of Manchuria weighed at least as heavily on the minds of the Japanese high commanders. There are other interpretations possible, but this is the kind of study (a close look at the minds of the Japanese high command, and their response to various things that happened in the last days) that is needed to answer this kind of question. One might also suggest that you would have to make a strong judgment about how important Nagasaki in particular was: it is not clear it played any role at all in the minds of the Japanese.   2) That the only other alternative was a land invasion. This is _not_ how the Allied leaders saw it. [And it is not clear it was the only alternative on the table at the time](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/08/03/were-there-alternatives-to-the-atomic-bombings/). The framing of ""two bombs on cities vs. total land invasion"" was deliberately constructed _in the postwar_ to justify the bombings, and _if you accept the framing_ then the use of (at least one of) the atomic bombs seems impossible to avoid. If you challenge the framing then the whole thing becomes much dicier. I think there are good reasons to challenge the framing.  3) That the land invasion would have been as bad as one can imagine it being (worst-case scenario) and on the whole would be far bloodier. Even accepting the land invasion option it's not clear this is the case, especially if one imagines the Soviet Union still entering the war, especially if one imagines alternative (non-city destroying) uses of the atomic bombs, especially if one imagines it happening in phases (as it was planned). I'm not saying the land invasion wouldn't have been terrible — it probably would have — but I just want to point out that in order to make an argument about saved lives you have to come up with some number of hypothetical avoided casualties, and that requires a strong counterfactual imagination. It is not the sturdiest of assertions.  Again, I think it's tricky.  > Japan were ruthless and not ready to surrender, ever  This isn't totally true (about surrender). There were efforts to consider the possibility of negotiated surrender in the summer of 1945, with the Soviet Union as a neutral mediator. It would have been a conditional surrender, one designed to preserve the position of the Emperor, but maybe other conditions as well. The US knew this and rejected it (the Soviets laughed at it, because they intended to join the war), and we don't know how far it would go, but it is not the action of a fanatical, ""never surrender"" nation.   And, of course, they _did_ surrender, in the end. First, conditionally, on August 10 (they accepted the conditions of Potsdam under the condition that the position of the Emperor be kept). After that was rejected by the US, and after an attempted coup by junior officers, the Emperor announced the unconditional surrender on August 14. Which is just to say: one can't simultaneously say they'd never surrender and then note that they did, of course, surrender. Whether the surrender conditions could have been tied to another event (e.g., if the Soviets had invaded but the US had not used the atomic bombs, or had only ""demonstrated"" one in a non-fatal way) is impossible to know. But if you believe the bombs induced them to surrender, then you do believe that some large event could have gotten them to the table, and there were other possible large events other than the killing of several hundred thousand civilians.   The military was resistant to surrendering but after the Soviet invasion made it clear that they understood it was not a survivable situation anymore. They had, as an aside, done studies on what would happen if the Soviets declared war against them and invaded — they had known for years that it would be catastrophic. This is one of the reasons this weighs heavily in historians' minds as the possible cause of surrender. As for the government, it depends who in the government one means — some were in favor of ending the war, some were not. The Cabinet was divided; in the end the Emperor himself had to make the final argument.   On the Occupation, I would just say: the US actually did a lot of work of rebuilding Japan, and doing so in a way that was (in the end) towards the promotion of a peaceful, modern democracy, one that could be a close ally of the US in the future. I think Japan is in a pretty good place today, in the end — their lack of a military does not seem to have hampered them unduly. They have spent their monies on many other things; I might suggest that the US would be a better place today if it had spent a little more of its military monies on things like what the Japanese spent their on (high speed rail, social safety net, etc.). But this is a political view, not a historical one. :-)"

I think this subreddit and its rule/mod structure is actually Important in a philosophical and political sense and probably deserves some study in its own right.  Struggles over the definition of truth and historical/scientific facts are not new, but they're very much in the foreground these days. Disinformation is weaponized and exploited by all kinds of bad actors across all media and myriad topics. Attacks on the validity of expert opinion are common, and in addition to their specific impacts in the debates of the day, add up to an erosion in the public conception of ""truth."" There's an increasing sense among many people, I think, that a lot of the time it's just too damn hard to know what the truth is in a lot of situations.  What we see here is a volunteer community working at the coal face of this problem, so to speak. The discussions about HOW the experts know things, and the ""error bars"" that are so often included in answers (those nuances where the expert includes a discussion of how certain a given answer is, problems with sources, alternate interpretations etc) model for the rest of us how to approach understanding of complex topics with imperfect sources. I find it personally inspiring and hopeful that this community thrives the way it does.  For me, AH matters on a fairly deep level. It's proof that a group of serious, thoughtful, educated people can have serious discussions about politicized topics in the era of disinformation warfare.

72565	0	a	"To a very real extent, the private lives of Romans is rather closed off to us. This is particularly true of the poor, but even of the rich, as biographical sources tend to overwhelmingly focus on the political careers of their subjects. To take one example, Julius Caesar has an early life that is to an extent unusually well documented--he lived in tumultuous times, and we have records of his meeting with Sulla, giving a speech for his fathers death, and being appointed (and unappointed) to an important priestly position, and making an alliance with King Nicomedes of Bithynia, all before he was twenty. It is a pretty remarkable set of teenage years and so we hear about them, and he later did some pretty remarkable things in his twenties such as court cases and pirate hunting that we also hear about. What we *don't* hear about is what he did on his days off, aside from shtupping the occasional political rival's wife, which I would honestly consider on-the-clock political work.  So when we talk about private, non-political life, we really need to toss aside many of our best sources and we rely heavily on mining other sources for details, particularly didactic moral sources, a handful of comedic sources, a few genres of poetry, etc. There is also archaeology, which similarly has some pretty fascinating insights (such as a sign outside a tavern that advertised prices for wine that, adjusted for daily wages, are roughly equivalent to what we pay per drink today, so you can put ""public drinking/bars"" on your list) but has some difficulty with telling us about individuals. It is great that we can see a [Roman streetside countertop](http://www.hultengren.com/travel/italy/pompeii1/img/big/rest3.jpg) but who actually used it is a bit opaque. The standard answer is that those served a poor clientele, because the rich went to dinner parties, and while I suspect that has an element of truth, I also have no problem imagining young elite Roman rascals going into taverns, similar to white hipsters in the twenties hanging around Harlem. One intriguing bit of evidence to my mind is the [graffiti of Pompeii](http://www.pompeiana.org/Resources/Ancient/Graffiti%20from%20Pompeii.htm) a lot of which refers to taverns, drinking in public and general carousing. Literacy was probably more widespread in Rome than we might suspect, but I rather doubt it penetrated much more than 50%, and so the guy who scribbled about how he wanted to screw the barmaid was at least ""middle class"". Other ones also mention brothels and the like, and there is one passage from the famously upright and dour Cato the Elder in which he recommends going to a brothel rather than taking out one's lust on other men's wives, but also says not to go too frequently (I can't find a good way to show the passage, so here is a somewhat unwieldy [Google Books link](https://books.google.com/books?id=idygDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=cato+the+elder+brothel&source=bl&ots=n5gCdgF9KD&sig=aSbSuB4MD9NFJ5eHhyhVBrqSE8E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjduJ2Q28XTAhVD6SYKHQIYAuEQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&q=cato%20the%20elder%20brothel&f=false)).  So drinking in bars and visiting brothels are open, but there is a significant complication with the latter, in that, to use an old distinction, there are prostitutes and there are courtesans, modeled after the Greek hetaera and somewhat analogous to *yiji* in China and the more formalized *geisha* of Japan. Essentially women who performed for men in a romantic but not necessarily sexual way, and were valued for their artistic abilities or skills in conversation. There is a lot of complexity here, but broadly speaking going to a prostitute might not just be a matter of sex. A powerful literary portrayal of this comes from Propertius' poetry set to Cynthia, who is somewhat gradually revealed to be this sort of courtesan. She is also implicitly referred to as unfree--I am somewhat revisionist on slavery in Rome as I tend to think people are far to ready to see slaves in things, but I suspect sex work in Rome was no more free of compulsion than it is today.  There are also dinner parties, which I suspect you are less interested in but certainly formed an important part of nightlife for the elite. And there is also general carousing and hellraising. Nero was said to wander the streets at night starting fights while he was emperor, and while this seems unlikely it implies that making trouble was something that young, aristocratic men did. Juvenal, who takes the literary persona of the poor, struggling intellectual, also notes that you need to be careful men with large retinues carrying torches and bronze lanterns at night. I am far from an expert, but I understand that in early modern Europe, particularly Florence, this sort of young, hellraising aristocrat was common, so I suspect something similar at Rome.  Hard to say much about gambling, but it did happen. Dice are a relatively common find.  To my mind the best readily available work on Roman daily life is Mary Beard's *Fires of Vesuvius* on Pompey, but she does take the traditional approach to ""rich eat in, poor eat out"" that I feel is worth complicated. Don't know a great source for that because the conclusion is my own (not that it is unique to me, I suspect), but Kristina Milnor's chapter in *Ancient Literacies* does a good job of talking about the grafitti of Pompeii. A lot of the rest is primary source, but I can point you in the right direction if you are curious on any given topic.  EDIT: I just saw your first edit. Not to disappoint, but the Romans were not actually masters of the subtle arts of debauchery. They certainly threw parties in which people got very drunk, but this happens today. They had bars, but we have bars. They had sex work, but sex work still exists today. The idea of Romans being particularly decadent is due to the conventions of Roman moralistic literature, as well as the interests of the monks who transmitted it, who cold use an image of a depraved pagan Rome as proof of the righteousness of Christianity. Probably the closest thing to what you are looking for is a description of the future empress Theodora, who began life as an actress, by the historian Procopius in *Secret Histories* 9:  >Often, even in the theater, in the sight of all the people, she removed her costume and stood nude in their midst, except for a girdle about the groin: not that she was abashed at revealing that, too, to the audience, but because there was a law against appearing altogether naked on the stage, without at least this much of a fig-leaf. Covered thus with a ribbon, she would sink down to the stage floor and recline on her back. Slaves to whom the duty was entrusted would then scatter grains of barley from above into the calyx of this passion flower, whence geese, trained for the purpose, would next pick the grains one by one with their bills and eat.  A reference to the mythological story of Leda and the swan. Given another post that is currently popular, I think it s worth emphasizing again that while I do not think enslaved status can necessarily be assumed in sex work, it was certainly common, and even those who were not legally slaves were not free of compulsion.  EDIT2: I just woke up to a bunch of follow up questions, which I will try to get to when I am free later today."

72573	0	a	"The problem with that line of thinking is on what grounds would we dispute it? The story of the pirates comes to us from two of our earlier sources on Caesar's life--and though there was lots and lots written on Caesar earlier, people like Cicero were unconcerned with laying out his early life. Neither Caesar's presence in the east at that time in his life nor his captivity would have been especially unusual. Young men of Caesar's time frequently went out east for their educations and for their first political appointments, serving (as Caesar did) under some provincial promagistrate. Cicero did the same, as did P. Clodius. At the young age of 24 Antony went off to Athens and served well for three years as Gabinius' cavalry prefect in his Egyptian expedition despite having no prior military experience. Moreover, at this time the pirates based on the Anatolian coast were increasingly getting out of hand. Funded by Mithridates they were particularly notorious for kidnapping wealthy youngsters like Caesar and ransoming them off--as they got bolder they began attacking cities, even sacking Ostia before Pompey was granted an extraordinary command to wipe them from the seas. Caesar's captivity was not particularly unusual--P. Clodius, to use the same example, was captured by pirates and held a grudge his entire life that Ptolemy, king of Cyprus, had only paid two talents out for ransom. What Caesar actually *did* during and after his captivity is another matter. Quotations, except in rare cases (e.g. Caesar's comment ""*hoc voluerunt; tantis rebus gestis Gaius Caesar condemnatus essem, nisi ab exercitu auxilium petissem*"" at Pharsalus, which Suetonius attributes to Pollio), are hard to confirm, so the things that Plutarch and Suetonius have Caesar say among the pirates are suspect. But Caesar held a military staff position, and Suetonius describes his action against the pirates as being an incidental one during the course of a minor incursion into Rhodes and Lycia. In general Caesar's early biography as presented by Suetonius and Plutarch is pretty free of legendary embellishment, unlike Alexander's, which Plutarch places alongside Caesar's. Their treatments are largely free of fantastic actions and sayings and consist, in essence, of catalogs of political appointments that would have been easily verifiable and which are generally pretty ordinary.  More importantly, if we are to suppose this is Augustan ""propaganda"" (a term which I will always object has no place even euphemistically in discussions of Roman literature) then to what end? Caesar's early life was pretty ordinary, and it's presented as fairly ordinary in our extant texts. The inclusion of a minor episode like that of the pirates serves to emphasize a particular facet of Caesar's character--character is an obsessive feature of the ancient biographers, and it's the explicitly stated point of Plutarch's writings. Fine, but what would that do for Augustus? Caesar's character was already (at least officially) self-evident by the time Octavian's political career began--Cicero either avoids the subject entirely or has nothing but praise for Caesar in his later writings. And what would it have gotten Augustus exactly? Augustan literature is generally free of comment on Caesar's personality and doesn't really mention Caesar much at all except to point out that he's deified and is Augustus' parent. If this is an Augustan interpolation it's an unusually well-attested one and a very unusual one that doesn't really seem to accomplish very much"

Quality answers _take time,_ and a lot of redditors have an extremely difficult time dealing with the concept that there isn't an answer here, now, immediately as I'm opening a thread for the first time.

72576	0	a	I'll give the question some thought over the weekend if a new thread pops up, /u/sammythemc.    As for the pirate incident specifically, whatever unease we feel about its veracity, we don't have to attribute it to Augustan propaganda.  Capture by pirates is plausible enough; Clodius is also reported to have been captured by pirates, for instance.  How Caesar comported himself during his captivity might be invention, but it needn't be later invention meant to justify an Augustan regime.  If we believe just the minimum of the story, that Caesar was captured by pirates, ransomed, and then killed all the pirates, the only person to report on Caesar's captivity is Caesar, and I think it's easy to see why a young politician who had already escaped Sulla's death squads might spread the report of his bravado in dangerous company.  Other young men performed similar stunts - Pompey raising his own troops to support Sulla, and demanding a triumph, for instance.  There might be something about the source of the report that inclines us to suspect Augustan fabrication, but I'll have to look more closely, and for that I will wait for the potential new question.

72582	0	a	/u/The_Alaskan 's response about Nixon's support during the Watergate Scandal might help to answer some of your questions:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5q1ls0/did_richard_nixon_have_apologists_in_the_press/dcwar3s 
72583	0	a	"Yes, I know some of them. Let me explain in the specific context of an organization/institution I've had some interactions with: The Richard Nixon Presidential Library.  The Richard Nixon Library was built in Yorba Linda, CA and opened in 1990. The federal government of the United States normally operates Presidential Libraries. They provide federal funding, send materials for safe-keeping to the libraries from the National Archives, and generally involve themselves in the administration and upkeep of the Library. When it came time to build the Nixon Library, the federal government opted not to involve itself. They refused to sanction it. So, instead, the Nixon family set about building their own library and in order to do so they raised 25 million dollars completely from private sources for its construction. That would indicate that there were plenty of Nixonians out there still eager to support the President. But there's more going on. In order to staff the Library, which was operating on a pretty tight budget given its lack of federal funding, the administration essentially incorporated an extensive system of volunteer docents, usually (but not exclusively) upper/middle class white elderly individuals, almost all of whom were universally Nixon supporters. In 2004-2005, the federal government finally authorized the absorption of the private Richard Nixon Library into the federally-funded and directed Presidential Library system. This, in turn, caused some significant consternation among both volunteers and other supporters of Nixon for fear that the National Archives would, in their administration, change the Library to a fundamentally negative portrayal of Nixon when it had been giving a relatively positive description of Nixon up until that point. Similarly, the National Archives were concerned that the Nixonian loyalists would essentially put up a constant struggle for control of the workings of the Library in order to maintain a distorted, intentionally rosy view of Nixon. Historian David Greenberg was quoted as saying, ""“With Nixon, there is such a history of distorting history that one has to be suspicious of whether the Nixon family or loyalists will continue... Even though we trust (the) archivist to do things honest and fairly, there are ways.” One real sticking point was the private Nixon Library folks wanting to cancel an annual conference on the Vietnam War when it became apparent that the anti-Nixon attendees would outnumber the pro-Nixon attendees. The National Archives basically had to step in and say, you can't do that, reschedule the conference. Things like that essentially have gone on for quite some time since, until relatively recently when the Library got a major overhaul and a lot of the loyalists were essentially either no longer involved or had passed away, now it's a relatively fair and balanced portrayal of Nixon's presidency.  Long story short, there were plenty of Nixon supporters who were actively involved as both volunteers, donors, and administrators at the Nixon Library both in its private and federally funded incarnations. My high school girlfriend's grandmother was actually a relatively high-level volunteer/coordinator for the docent program and was herself a Nixon supporter and thus knew a large number of Nixon supporters who I had occasion to meet at a number of social events. They tended to stray away from talking about Watergate (keep in mind I was in high school at the time, so I wasn't really able to engage them in the kind of conversations I would be able to as an adult now) and focused on the most positive aspects of Nixon's presidency. When pushed, I heard a number of them express the idea that Watergate was overblown or a political hit-job, despite Nixon's wrongdoing. I had similar experiences interacting with many of the docents at the museum (to this day, I was there not long ago and there's still plenty of elderly pro-Nixon docents hanging around). They are out there and they are very supportive/protective of a man they believe to be a good President brought down by his enemies rather than his own flaws.  Sources:  Personal experience  http://www.latimes.com/la-oe-greenberg9jul09-story.html  http://www.ocregister.com/2006/01/26/nixon-library-joins-the-fold/  Bonus content: Hunter S. Thompson's obituary for Nixon, a must read political piece imho: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/  Edit: I should clarify that the ""despite Nixon's wrongdoing"" is my own interjection, because, objectively, Nixon did bad things, there was a reason Ford had to pardon him. The people that I knew who were Nixonians almost entirely believed he didn't do anything wrong or, in a push, anything another President wouldn't have done in his position. Rather, they felt he was unjustly brought down by his political enemies and devious detractors. The original Watergate exhibit at the Richard Nixon Library tended to significantly trend that way."

72587	0	a	I’ve done a lot of research on this (the Inca) but I’m unfortunately not at home so I can’t pull any of books out at the moment, but when I get home I may find them in a box and be better able to source these answers and double check my memory.  One reason is that the last (free) Incan emperor fled east into the Amazon jungle because of how effective Spanish cavalry was when augmented with infantry. The distinction of free Inca is important - for a considerable period, the Spanish tried to maintain the illusion of puppet/vassal emperors, the first of which was Tupac Huallpa. In fact, the point of the greatest resistance to the Spanish happened during the reign of the second such puppet emperor, Manco Inca, after his terrible mistreatment by the Spanish.  The advantage of metal weapons and armor in the Spanish cuirrasiers as well as firearms is often cited in the Spanish conquest of the Americas, but in Peru, where Pizzarro had an order of magnitude fewer conquistadors than Cortez - I think Cortez had \~2500 or 5000 and Pizzaro had around 500, of which almost 100 were cavalry? Again no primary sources to double check but I will edit when I return home if the numbers are wrong, but regardless there was a serious  disparity in the two Spaniard’s size and army composition. In Peru, cavalry rather than metal per se was the decisive factor. After a few engagements it seems the Inca realized that their overwhelming numbers would eventually win out against Spanish infantry *if they could piecemeal attack the very thinly spread Spaniards*, but not against cavalry in the plains, so they began ambushing small columns from cliffsides and across rivers. This did result in a handful of minor victories in which fewer than a dozen Spaniards were killed in total, which were immense morale victories, but more often than not Spaniards were able to withdraw in good order to eventually reform in terrain they knew they could win.  It also isn’t part of the general western imagining of the conquests, but it cannot be understated that both Pizarro and Cortez were very reliant on the thousands of native allies they had to supply them but also act as the anvil to their hammer, as native infantry secured their flanks from imperial Incan armies during their major engagements. The story of how these natives became allies is itself fascinating but outside the scope of this question. The siege of Cuzco, the major event of Manco’s resistance/rebellion, lasted as long as it did because even though there was a sizable Spanish infantry garrison, they had split and sent most of their force, including the ultra-important cavalry, elsewhere, and what cavalry remained didn’t have sufficient support from native infantry to protect itself and break the siege on their own for a great while.  The Inca tried several resolutions to Spanish technology, the aforementioned ambushes, but the only time there was a serious and significant challenge to Spanish authority after Atahualpa actually involved feats of engineering, which the Inca were masters of, from their [exceptional road system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_road_system) to [cyclopean, monolithic fortresses like Ollantaytambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollantaytambo). During the last large scale battle (which I can recall without primary sources), Ollantaytambo, the Inca rerouted nearby irrigation canals to flood the battlefield, hoping to force the Spanish to dismount. The Spanish weren’t willing to assault without their cavalry advantage, but the Inca weren’t or couldn’t press the advantage either (I can’t recall why, again no sources in front of me), and shortly after the majority of the Spanish forces returned. With that, Manco knew the one ace he had the Spanish army didn't, Incan engineering, had been played, in likely the only place where he would have time, resources, and most importantly opportunity to attempt it, and was forced to flee.  His choice of retreat was excellent as the jungle and mountain highlands prevented Spanish cavalry from maneuver and the visibility greatly reduced the utility of Spanish guns, which did not completely but did go a great way toward leveling the field of combat, as the post-Cuzco empire, sometimes call the neo-Inca empire, held out for decades in the Amazonian jungle, aided by a combination of disease, secrecy, and the lack of cavalry. However, Manco was never able to command large infantry forces, most nobles having been swayed by Spanish victory after Ollantaytambo, and the Spanish were able to scout and pursue using primarily native forces with Spanish officers.  Let me take a moment and say that it is actually contentious whether or not the Inca royalty did or did not retreat to Machu Picchu at some point and whether or not the Spanish did or did not go to Machu Picchu independent of that during the manhunt for Manco post Ollantaytambo. There are some historians (a minority, but a legitimate and credible one, not some crazy ancient-aliens minority as seems to sometimes unfortunately gravitate to Incan history) who believe that there is evidence Manco Inca did briefly hide at Machu Picchu in the interim period between fleeing Ollantaytambo and the failed siege of Cuzco and arriving at Vilcabamba, the palace within the Amazon. The Spanish were hesitant to explore the mountains and jungles where they knew their cavalry were ineffective *and* the Inca could arrange ambushes, but Machu Picchu’s only real defense was its secrecy. It is too small to house a large garrison and even a small garrison would have been problematic - while the palace had gardens for supporting the servants, from what I recall the palace was primarily supported by nearby villages and could not have self-sustained, and that support would have ended during a siege, at which point the Spanish and their Incan allies would have vastly outnumbered the garrison. If he had retreated to Machu Picchu, and as I said there is contention whether he did or did not briefly, word of Spanish aligned scouts may have pushed him from Machu Picchu to Vilcabamba A. so as not to be trapped and B. for the aforementioned benefits of the jungle in countering one of the most important Spanish advantage, although by that point Spanish reinforcements from Mexico were arriving and different native noble groups had been granted elevated positions of power/bribed so as to supplant those who had held power in the Incan hierarchy, and by the time of Vilcabamba any hope of a serious resistance was functionally over.  Edit: apologies for all the typos, this was done on a phone.  The most useful resources in my research were “Last Days of the Inca” by [Kim MacQuarrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_MacQuarrie) and secondarily “Conquest of the Inca” by [John Hemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hemming_(explorer)), but I’m still not home to pull out specific quotes and pages.

72590	0	a	"Kim MacQuarrie's ""Last Days of the Inca"" and John Hemming's ""Conquest of the Inca"" are both excellent, they were my favorite and most colorful explorations of the matter when I was reading about the Inca for work and also the most in depth. Both explore in differing ways the role that native allies played in helping the Spanish conquer the Inca, although it is not truly their focus.  /u/Pachamcamac is probably more qualified to speak on Andean resources and he wrote an excellent comment with detailed resources that deserves more attention [elsehwere in the thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/affur9/machu_picchu_was_never_discovered_by_the_spanish/edzsrbg) you may find it insightful. I am not an expert on the Inca, I had to become an amateur one for a work project.  The cliff notes would be that, more than the military exploits, the Spanish did a masterful job of exploiting weaknesses at the foundation of the Incan empire. Those weaknesses grew from its explosive rise from a kingdom under Pacha Kuti (there are myriad spellings of his name) to an empire in the way which almost all empires are built, through the conquest of other peoples. The Inca maintained their empire through a system of (forced) marriage and, from at least some historian's perspective, continued, ritualized terror of their conquered peoples. Their name for their ruler, ""Sapa Inca"" itself hints at the deeply familial aspect of its government - Inca (or Inka) is the familial name of the supreme royal family of Cuzco. Calling it the Incan empire as compared to the Cuzcan empire would be similar to calling the Roman empire the ""Julio-Claudian"" empire - . Sapa Inca, the name for the ruler, just means ""the only Inca"", i.e. the patriarch of the Inca family.  The Inca were excellent conquerors but, as Omar Bradley quote fabulously puts it, ""Amateurs discuss strategy. Professionals talk logistics."" More than anything, the Inca's ability to construct roads in the rugged Andes to support and transport their large armies was immensely important to their conquest of their neighbors, who were often at similar or in some cases (from what I recall reading) arguably more advanced states of development, such as [the Moche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche_culture) (those same roads were invaluable to the Spanish in time).  After conquest, the Inca imposed taxes, which included their religion upon native peoples. This religion, which, to the extent I have read, was in many regards not dissimilar from neighboring cultures in its religious/military/political aspects or utility, but became something of a sticking point with their conquered people, and I've read different commentaries arguing that it wasn't simply imposed as a religion, but became a tool of state sponsored terrorism to keep conquered peoples pacified.  The Incan taxation system was unusual (not for the Americas but in most other cultures) in that, along with ordinary tribute/taxes (jewels, silver, livestock, etc), it included a human taxation. Human taxation has actually been pretty standard throughout time and actually existed in other cultures as well, it took the form of mandatory work time: at a certain time in the year, communities were expected to  send workers to maintain the roads, bridges, and forts that were so essential to the Incan military - just, to give a sense of how amazing these roads were, [the Incan ability to transmit information via the Chasquis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasqui) is mind boggling in a society that had no horses and was in many parts mountainous, and that messenger system was a product of the roads, waystations, and forts that the Incan military supported through tax tribute and built by those mandatory labor taxes. But there was another kind of human taxation, a kind of state terror program in which the children of foreign polities like the Moche linked above, were sent to Cuzco to be ritually killed.  The Inca do not seem to have practiced human sacrifice to the scale of the Aztecs, and there is some indication that certain Sapas outlawed the practice at various times, but they [archaeological work shows they definitely did practice it in what they called Capacocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacocha) consistently over time, even if not continuously, and it was aligned with the Inca Sapa - if he fell sick, or if one died, there would be sacrifices, and people knew where their children were being sent. And what a strong reminder of who your conqueror is - ""the king fell sick, we are gonna need a few more of your kids to replace the ones you just sent us we had to kill to bring him back to health, the empire appreciates it"". What is interesting, you'll note from that wikipedia link, is that A. the translation is ""royal obligation"", i.e. a tax, B. most of the children came from outlying (more recently conquered) territories.  The Spaniards were appalled at this, as many people today would be. One of the (many) ways the Spaniards persuaded natives to aid them was by promising to lower taxes, which included ending the sacrifices. Now, what is much less clear is if the natives understood this in the way the Spaniards meant, which was ""by forcefully converting everyone to Catholicism as subjects of the Spanish Crown"" or more as ""we will help you conquer your Inca oppressors and now they will have to give you tribute"", because, as I mentioned, human sacrifice was pervasive in pre-Colombian America and it was part of many local different religions, and people don't generally participate in religion without believing it. I saw little evidence in my reading that any historians think the Andean people saw the practice as bad per se, only that it was not great to be the one footing the bill with your children - quite the opposite would be my interpretation. The resistance to Catholocism and some of the fascinating fusions of pre-Colombian ritual and catholocism, such as the parading of the saints in a similar manner to how the mummies of Sapa Incas were paraded, indicates to me the answer is that people believed this religion and didn't exclusively see it as a political tool, even if it was also used as one. I think the difficulty Spanish priests had in filtering pagan aspects is a clear indication that people were not angry about the religion itself and probably expected to continue the practice, simply by reversing the roles of who gives Capacocha.  Something MacQuarrie emphasizes in ""Last Days of the Inca"" is a pretty good microcosm of the questions around ""to what extent was taxation and human sacrifice a thing the natives were concerned with in helping the Spaniards?"" It's the question of the truth of post-conquest writing by the descendants of native people: those who were literate were often mestizos who found themselves targets for suspicion as native sympathizers by Spanish governors/anyone with an [encomienda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encomienda), but as the children of Spaniards they also were often in positions where they stood to be quite powerful and wealthy if they could prove their loyalty to Spain. Some writers were very denigrating of native religion even while speaking very highly of other truly impressive achievements such as the engineering feats of Ollantaytambo, which could not have been completed without the system of taxation that also happened to include human sacrifice.  Today (in America at least) I think it’s fair to say we are much more open in our discussions of the cost of colonization to the native people, but I think a misconception has arisen that people at the time universally thought what they were doing was just. Undeniably some/many did, but one of the tragedies of the post-conquest restructuring is that there were Spanish contemporaries who, if not initially, eventually recognized the cruelties Pizarro, the conquistadors, and the [Encomienda system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encomienda) were inflicting on the natives in the effort to stamp out any trace of human sacrifice or paganism. Those complaints were taken seriously by the Spanish crown initially and were simply ignored in the colonized places because, well, Latin America is very far removed from Spain, oversight was limited, and the profits of killing so many indigenous people were so immense that, in some of the same sense that we today look the other way toward labor exploitation in poor countries, people were willing to look aside at how awful the replacement system was for the natives. [Bartolome de las Casas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas) comes to mind as a complex person who generally agitated for change. I cannot recall which resource or whose account it was I was reading, but one of the grievances against the Spanish crown in the post-Inca environment by later Peruvian writers was that the Spanish had secured native aid on the promise of reduced taxation, only for those natives to find that once Pizarro had settled into power, even though they had stopped the ritual kililng as a form of taxation, far more were dying of the commercial labor tax being exacted to work as slaves or in royal silver mines."
72591	0	a	It definitely is getting repetitive, but on the flip side, the format does make for a fairly specific and clear question. And early on at least, I would even say original! It still has potential even, and with a bit of subverting could still lead to some interesting thing (the mod team was in agreement the question flipping it to a woman was a nice twist).  What I will say though is that as a question gets stale, people get less interested in *answering* them, and the continued use of the pattern will likely lead to them going unanswered, unlike the early ones which got some really great responses (which likely helped get the momentum going). So that is something people should consider when using the format.
72592	0	a	"Speaking from our perspective as mods, we too have also heard some unhappiness from contributors and users about these questions and that this has developed into a ""thing"". We even talked about it [in the latest Friday-Free-for-All thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/682ta1/friday_freeforall_april_28_2017/dgvyq80/).  These questions have now become a thing that will most likely disappear again soon (though I have to say, I am a bit disappointed I haven't had to remove [I am a hot blooded foreigner and I've got a fever of a hundred and three. Baby, do you do more than dance?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c1m2BAg2Sc) yet) but the ""I am a ..."" questions have long been, if not controversial, at least a point of minor disagreement among user and contributors on this site. Some people think they are immensely annoying (and every time one comes around, there is at least on person thinking they are super original by posting ""No, you are not"") while others like them.  Because we are historians, I think it's fair to talk about this question format and its relation to historiography and generally how we ""do"" history.  I'm generally more on the pro-side of the ""I am a ..."" questions. The reason behind this is that they are a chance not only to highlight the history behind the question but one of the major factors we grapple with in the study of history pretty much all across the board: The difficulty of accessing the lives of the people who make up the vast majority of all history: the ordinary people, the farmers, wage laborers, artisans, butchers, bakers and candle stick makers; the poor, the downtrodden, the women, and the slaves – in short, all the people who were not kings, generals and politicians and who made the whole place hum and work. Questions like what they did for fun, what their aspirations and every day concerns were, how they perceived themselves and the world around them is an immensely interesting subject, especially given that unlike kings, generals, and other ""great man"" figures, they comprise the majority of the people in history.  The problem here and it is a problem that has been famously addressed with the question [Can the subaltern speak?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/384ty2/monday_methods_can_the_subaltern_speak/), meaning that how do we address writing about people who themselves have left no writing but have only been written about by others. Where we can address them and their perspectives – such as in the case of *The Cheese and the Worms* or *The Return of Martin Guerre* (if you haven't, check out the book or at least the movie. Seriously, it'll be worth your time) – the ""I am a ..."" question gives us the chance to share what can be gleaned from these works of scholarship and from the study of the historical perspective of the ""ordinary"" person. Plus, it is immensely refreshing, in my opinion, that through the thick of all the questions about what Adolf Hitler liked to have for breakfast and what he thought about hat fashion, there are questions that take into account that history is more than just the story of men like Hitler, Churchill, Stalin etc.  On the other hand – and here's where we get to the criticism of these questions – many who don't like them assert that questions of similar content and with a similar focus could be asked be better and the ""I am a ..."" format always includes both elements of presentism, meaning that they project things we do today back in the past like ""going out with your mates"", and are still pretty limiting, as for example the latest wave of ""hot blooded questions"" for the most part completely left out women of the equation (save a few which have not been upvoted much).  And they are right in their criticism: Many of these questions imply certain behaviors as anthropological in the sense of eternal, natural, and present throughout history as well as again limiting the scope of questions to the historical subjects the asker can imagine while those who are usually not afforded much of a subjectivity in current social narratives are also left out of these questions.  So, indeed, these questions can be formulated and asked better (as can [the Hitler questions btw.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4cewq8/on_adolf_hitler_great_man_theory_and_asking/)). At the same time, this is something contributors can address (as has /u/Tiako in the Roman version of this questions that started it all) and is also among the reasons why we as mods would not disallow these questions as we won't disallow the Hitler questions (be warned though, there is a limit to what we are willing to accept in terms of these questions in the name of common decency. ""I'm a member of the Einsatzgruppen. How can I unwind after killing 30.000 Jews?"" will not fly here. Period.)  Our general philosophy in terms of questions is to approach it very light handedly. After all, people are here to have their questions answered and we give questions a lot of leeway, including allowing those with false premises. We are here for education after all and limiting questions heavily to the ones we want to be asked would not really serve that purpose at all.  So, maybe it would be time for us to re-run and/or re-write some tips on how to ask better questions (or as Zhukov put it once to make not-stupid-question not-stupider), including a specific address of these kinds of questions.

Then we can get a step beyond that and point out that these questions really get at the heart of how the society in question understands masculinity and what it means to be a man--if premarital sex is officially banned, but schoolmasters are basically fine with the occasion girl in a boy's bed, what is the ""actual"" ideal for a male teenager?  And then: our written records for Nahuatl social history are basically all colonial era, and a *lot* of recent scholarship has worked on the ulterior motives and extent of trustworthiness of the sources. If Sahagun is working to make Mexica culture translateable to his Spanish readers as well, what biases might creep in? What is at stake in portraying ideal Nahuatl society as so disciplined and regimented? How would the intense valuation on discipline color descriptions of teenage rowdiness?

72611	0	a	I can't speak to Roman or Egyptian bread, but a recent collaborative project has been studying early medieval English bread and [sharing their results on a fantastic blog](https://earlybread.wordpress.com/). The project is a collaboration between Debby Banham (University of Cambridge) and Martha Bayless (University of Oregon), and their research is still ongoing.  They argue that most bread would have been flat bread, and likely unleavened. Think dense, heavy biscuits. Poorer households would have used bean flours, while mixtures of rye and wheat would have been the choice of people who were better off. Sometimes, oats or barley might be available (though oats were probably cultivated more for horses, and barley for beer). All these flours are low in gluten (except for wheat), and would as a consequence have been pretty dense (gluten is the protein that allows bread to build a springy, airy structure when leavened with yeast). Refined, fluffy, yeast-raised wheat bread was rarer: you have to throw away a lot of the flour when you sift it to make white bread, and that's a luxury. You also have to cook it in an oven, which takes more fuel to fire than flat bread (which can be cooked on a rock in the hearth, or a frying pan). As a consequence, the kind of bread we enjoy today would have been something of a rarity, reserved for wealthy tables or special occasions. Ordinary people would have eaten something much more dense, tough, and filling.
72612	0	a	"They found a carbonized loaf of bread in pompeii which at least looks very familiar to what bread looks like today.

There is also a YouTube video there of someone recreating the bread, which you could try for yourself.

But judging by the earlier comments about sourdough that /u/Priapulid made, and by the types of flour they used, it looks like the recipe took at least some of that into account.

72614	0	a	"Just a minor point regarding leavened bread: modern leavened bread is done with ""quick rising"" baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Breads that would have been made prior to the ability to isolate this yeast would have been colonized by wild yeast and bacteria that would vary depending on location. Basically you mix flour and water and allow it to ferment into a 'starter', and use that starter to leaven your dough. Lactobacili (and possibly other bacteria) get involved  and this can lead to a sour taste and in the modern world this is essentially sourdough bread.   [This article about Egyptian bread](http://www.historicalcookingproject.com/2014/12/guest-post-ancient-egyptian-bread-by.html) illustrates that there is a debate if ""ancient"" bread was all unleavened/unfermented or if some was /some wasn't.   >*The only element that can bring some debate to this recipe is the yeast. Some scholars believe that the Egyptian breads were mostly flatbreads, similar to the pitas that you can still find in Egypt. Others believe that Egyptians used some kind of leavening. The Bible's Book of Exodus, for example, talks about the Hebrews leaving the unleavened bread to be able to flee from the Egyptians.*   It is entirely possible to leaven bread in most climates (arctic being a possibly exception) and considering many of the cultures in question had at least basic knowledge about fermenting alcohol they likely understood that at least some flours would rise well if left to ferment.   As a side note: making sourdough bread is incredibly easy, fun, and cheap. If you haven't tried it I would highly recommend it."

72616	0	a	"Hi, I'm a beer sommelier and not a historian, so I'm not versed in the art of sourcing, but I can answer your question.   In short, it wasn't. It wasn't until Louis Pasteur first demonstrated the process of contamination, and subsequently studied alcoholic and lactic fermentation in beer, wine and milk, and thus we could identify the microorganisms involved in those processes, that we developed the techniques required to isolate and multiply specific species and strains of yeast *in vitro*.   Before this time, there was not much more than the cultural knowledge that fermentation *happens*, and despite the ignorance of the actual mechanism, there were thousands of years of accumulated empirical knowledge on how to begin and, to a certain extent, control fermentation. This also can explain well the long cultural relationship between bread and fermented beverages and religion, because honestly if you don't know germs exist and all your grape juice and wet grain is turning into a drug that makes you euphoric and uninhibited, you'll probably come to the conclusion that there's something magical happening here. But I digress.   Traditionally there have been many ways to cultivate yeasts without knowing what they are, and they all revolve around the same principle of keeping a bit of what's been fermented to be used the next time. Breweries would often have a ""blessed"" wooden stirring paddle that (we now know) had become infested with yeasts from previous brewing, and was used to stir the next batch, thus beginning fermentation. Sometimes they would keep a piece of wood made for this specific purpose, or harvest some of the trub(the layer of residue left in the bottom of a fermenter, which, we now know, is composed mostly of dead and live yeast cells) and dump that in the next batch. Bakers would do similarly by using some stale bread, which would also carry live yeast cells, to start the next batch of bread. It's worth noting that the main yeasts used for bread and beer are the same species. With yogurt also, to this day many people make homemade yogurt by using the previous batch to start the next. Sometimes, most notably with wine and what we now call wild ales, cheese and so on, there was no direct inoculation of any form, instead the makers would simply prepare the base product and let nature do its magic. This is because yeasts and fermenting bacteria like lactobacili exist all around us, in minute quantities, so given enough time and exposure, anything that has fermentable material will ferment. Of course, this means a lot less control over the final product, but also a lot more complexity, as instead of one cultivated strain acting on the food, you will have a myriad of different yeasts and bacteria competing, to different results. Beer is still made this way in some places in Belgium (Lambics), and now the US and Brazil are making some too since it's delicious. Wine is also made this way, the skin of grapes naturally gathers yeasts, so grape juice pretty much always turns to wine, unless it's pasteurized.   Hope I was clear enough. Book sources for this include Randy Mosher's Tasting Beer, and The Brewmaster's Table and The Oxford Companion to Beer, both of these by Garrett Oliver. If the mods feel I need to provide more sources or reformat this in any way, please let me know.   E: one piece of trivia: sometimes you'll see advertisements for Budweiser claiming that they use Beechwood in their process, and that somehow enhances flavor. This is marketing bullshit. They use chunks of washed Beechwood precisely because it *doesn't* affect the beer flavor, and wood provides an excellent medium for yeast to attach itself to. Other breweries do just fine without this, and others still actually use wood for flavor in many ways, but not in the fermentation process. "

Similar themes and songs (trains, the legend of John Hardy, etc.) appear all across what could be termed folk music in the 20's and 30's.  Potentially the biggest industry-produced effect that pushed along these schisms was the distinction between white and ""colored"" artists early on in recording history. Music by black artists and marketed for a black audience was ""race music,"" while music by white artists and marketed for a white audience was ""hillbilly music."" Other music forms you mentioned that were popular within Hispanic and Latino communities were recorded but, since the bigger artists in those genres sang in Spanish, those styles had little popular appeal until the Latino population grew later in the century. My knowledge of early Latino music is a incomplete so if I am wrong, please correct me.  The Blues-Country schism was also reinforced by segregation and the institutionalization of both genres. Early in music recording history, it would've been unusual to find an artist of either race who sang only country or only blues. But the broad local appeal of the sounds led to commercial success, and of course there were forces which wanted to capitalize on that success. The WSM Barn Dance started in 1925, but its name soon changed. In 1927, while introducing African American harmonica player DeFord Bailey, announcer George Hay called the program the ""Grand Ole Opry"" for the first time, and it would eventually become the dominant stage in country music and end goal for aspiring country artists. I have no knowledge of the Ryman Auditorium, the Opry's home, being segregated. However, it is likely, though hard to determine, that small-time black country artists had reduced appeal due to the Jim Crow laws of the states they performed in, which contributed to the appearance of country as being white.  The two genres also developed differently and diverged. Blues gave birth to jazz. A jazz-infused country styled called Western Swing was born in the 40's. The Grand Ole Opry became able to determine what styles would get national exposure. In a way, what the Opry said was country was what became country. By the mid 40's to mid 50's, this was Honky Tonk. This was a sound that was blues-influenced but not similar to blues the way old hillbilly music was. Still, in the Honky Tonk era, Blues had a tremendous impact on country music. Hank Williams, a white country music star (one of the legends of country music), learned guitar from a blues musician. But the blues forms that impacted country no longer had appeal to the urban African American in post-Great Migration Chicago and it would take the electrification of the blues to reintroduce it as a popular form. Later, the country music establishment purposefully changed styles to a mass-appeal Nashville Sound which kept little from the Honky Tonk style immediately preceding and had little visible blues influence, so even the older blues players had little interest in mainstream country anymore.  There have been black artists who have been influential in country music, but it wasn't until the 60's, with Ray Charles releasing an album of traditional country songs and Charley Pride becoming the first black performer on the Grand Ole Opry since DeFord Bailey's firing in 1941. However, the introduction of Outlaw Country, whose performers sometimes released songs glorifying the South, which was sometimes tied to the Civil War, understandably turned a lot of Black listeners away and towards other sounds like funk, disco, and what would eventually become hip-hop.  Black country artists exist today, but the location of country's center in the South, the harsh Jim Crow laws in much of country's market, the controversial inclusion of the Confederacy in some styles of country, the early industry-driven distinction between blues, country, and other folk music, and the shifting interest of black audiences away from both country and blues, led to country being a white-dominated genre.  PBS I believe recently did a nice miniseries called [American Epic](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/american-epic/) that explores a few different artists of the 20's and 30's across a broad range, including country, blues, tejano, and hawaiian.  This is also like my second answer on here so let me know if I can do better. It's nice to see American folk musicology get covered.  EDIT: Thought I might add how fitting this question is for the theme, as I generally consider the 1940s to be the time where blues and country significantly diverge stylistically."

72620	0	a	"Pretty much on point. The recording industry noticed those black blues players very early on, and some even tried to get them on record and make money off of them, but never really succeeded.  Blues music wasn't even known as blues untill 1912, with Hart Wand's Dallas Blues. Before that is was pretty much known as ""race music"". Music by black people, for black people. The way the music was marketed at the time, same for the whiter musics, very much reflected the social state of society. There was a very big divide between blacks and whites in society, so it made sense to keep the music seperate aswell.   This caused the primary players in music (ie, Billboard Magazine) to treat blues very much like a commodity. Something merely to sell people. It was advertised in their magazine as music that ""rings the race register for both of these sides"" (Billboard Magazine 01-02-1947: 165), which slowly evolved in more neutral reviews like “While the recordings may sound dated, this only adds to the charm of the package” (Billboard Magazine 15-07-1972: 32) or “It's Ollie Shephard singing his own True Love Blues and Psy Day Blues, a small band paving the way rhythmically at a moderate tempo” (Billboard Magazine 17-01-1942: 64).  The authenticity of the blues players themselves, the authenticity of their music, the ""lived"" sounds of their music started to become an important point of reviews about their music. In other words, their race started to get a more positive connotation when associated with their music, while it really started out as an argument not to listen to it because ""it's music for the black joints"".  Now in this 40's the emancipation of the black people in America started to get along quite nicely, and it is easily discernible that from around this area the legitimitazion of blues as an artform started to be accepted more and more by a increasingly broader audience. The blues artists themselves got more people to show up to their gigs, suddenly white people started to show up. In the early 60's there was a massive blues boom in England, mainly by the post-war generation, that wanted to distinguish themselves from their wartorn parents and grandparents. This bluesboom was instrumental in bringing to light a lot of the blues artists, and really, making them famous. Several of those hadn't performed a single song in dozens of years, like Mississippi John Hurt who recorded nothing after his first couple of sides in 1928, only to be rediscovered in 1963 by a blues enthusiast from England. So goes the story for several of those blues artists, who were simply tracked down and thrust into the limelight by their adoring English fans.   The increasingly positive relations between the black people and white people caused a process called ""isomorphism"" to take place. The basic idea here is that a less popular entity will copy things from a more popular entity to somehow become more popular itself. The blues musicians started taking progressively more things from the popular music at the time in an attempt to get their music more accepted in the mainstream. Interestingly it wasn't the blues musicians mimicing the more popular folk or country music that caused them to really get their music legitimized, but as i described in the previous paragraph it was mainly the alreayd established players discovering this whole new music and basing their sounds around it. They started to mix in characteristics from blues in their own music, which in turn caused blues to get legitimized as an art form.   My favorite story about this whole process of the legitimization of blues as an art form involves the first time B.B. King performed for a primarily white audience.   > I was booked into the Filmore West. Now we used to play the Filmore all the time, but it was then about 90% black. But this time when I'm booked to go into the Filmore West, I come up there, man, and they had about five or six stairs that led up to the doorway. And it was long-haired white people, men and women, sitting body to body going up to the door. So my old bus pulled up, and I told my road manager, ""I think they booked us in the wrong place. You better go in there and check it out."" So he went in, and he found the promoter, Bill Graham. Bill came out and said, ""B., this is the right place."" And I said to myself, ""Oh God, what do I do here?"" But he came out and got me.   >    Inside the Filmore auditorium, people were sitting down on the floor. There were no chairs, tables - everyone sitting on the floor, but they seemed to be very calm. You know, nowadays you'd be trying to step over, step around, and some guy looks at you, ""Man don't step on me."" They didn't do any of that. They would just bend over one way or the other and let us pass. And I went to the same old dressing room where we used to go, and I'm as nervous as a cat when a dog's around.   >    When Bill brought me to the stage, [he gave me] one of the shortest and best intro's I've ever had. He said, ""Ladies and gentlemen…."" Everyone was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. ""I bring you the chairman of the board, B.B. King."" Everybody stood up and I cried. That was the beginning of it.

72622	0	a	Certainly. So bluegrass, in its early form, was not very different from early country. The early form of bluegrass, Appalachian dance music, was intended to accompany dancers and dancing competitions, though it evolved to being listened to purely for pleasure. Earlier country artists, like Uncle Dave Macon, recorded some songs that sound similar to the early bluegrass sound. Although I don't like to point at specific dates as being finite points in a continuous evolution of music, two years and one man stick out to me: 1939, 1945, and Bill Monroe. Bill Monroe is considered the father of bluegrass and his heritage (from Kentucky, the Blue Grass State) and his band (the Blue Grass Boys) are the sources for the genre's name. Monroe had been a musician for some years before forming the Blue Grass Boys in 1939, who played Appalachian folk music. This style was, for its time, pretty old-timey and based on the old string bands that had dominated the early Opry and hillbilly charts. So in a way, bluegrass was always at least slightly different from contemporary mainstream county. However, Monroe and his band's sound changed sharply in 1945, when Monroe discovered banjo player Earl Scruggs, whose three-finger style wowed audiences and has since become the standard for bluegrass music.  Though Scruggs left in 1949 with fellow Blue Grass Boy Lester Flatt to form the Foggy Mountain Boys (whose Foggy Mountain Breakdown you have definitely heard), Monroe continued to hire banjo players that played in Scruggs' style, and Ralph Stanley of the Stanley Brothers, another early bluegrass group, also picked up the three-finger technique. Because of Monroe's reputation as a tough bandleader, musicians often came and went in the Blue Grass Boys, which had the effect of producing a diaspora of bluegrass musicians that spread the style. It is during this time, 1945-1950, that bluegrass, to me, is no longer old time hillbilly music, and definitely isn't mainstream country, which by this point consisted of the beat-driven Honky Tonk style (bluegrass is, in contrast, very melodic). I place 1950 as the end of this time because that early to mid 50s were considered to be Monroe's, and bluegrass in general's, first golden age.

Nevertheless, I only found one opinion poll taken from before the lethal ending to the Waco Siege and that only polled Waco residents, a small and obviously not-representative sample of the US population. Further, in [this series of polls](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-govt-covered-up-waco/), it's interesting to see how radically public opinion shifted against the government as the nineties progressed.  To clarify the ""large segment"" who supported David Koresh and the Branch Davidians, I found three opinion polls taken from April 1993.   70% of people polled supported the government's actions at Waco, versus 27% who opposed it according to [the ABC Poll from 1993](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-govt-covered-up-waco/).   [A poll from the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/us/death-in-waco-washington-memo-a-strategy-of-openness-aims-to-avert-backlash.html?mcubz=2) found 8 out of 10 Americans believed David Koresh was responsible for the deaths at Waco.  And finally, a poll taken from the [Waco Tribune Herald (footnote 5)](http://www.stateofformation.org/2012/06/“not-the-jesus-i-love-waco-residents-perception-of-the-branch-davidian-conflict-by-janet-jensen) has only fifty percent of locals supporting government action against the Branch Davidians, though 82% supported the government's ending of the siege.  As detailed in both the CBS poll and Gore Vidal's *Decline and Fall of the American Empire* those who opposed the actions of the FBI and ATF were largely hostile to what they perceived as government overreach. They saw the Branch Davidians as harmless, ""minding their own business,"" and not doing anything that should provoke the violent repression meted out by the federal besiegers. The fact that it was families pitted against heavily armed troopers with armored personnel carriers and tanks made for pretty poor optics regardless of whose side one took.   The first, ostensible reason given by the Clinton Administration for infiltrating the BD Compound was to seize illegally held arms, a stick in the eye for Americans who hold the Second Amendment dear. When the agents assigned to this mission were repulsed and the situation began to heat up, George Stephanopoulos, the White House Communications Director changed the narrative to one of trying to save the children sequestered with their families. Against this claim, Pastor Robert McCurry points out that [this was an illegitimate use of federal force](http://www.islandone.org/Politics/Waco.McCurry.html) given that child protection falls under state jurisdiction. McCurry, well attuned to the limits of legitimate force, rails against what he sees as a monstrous attack by the government against its people.   Remember, this is less than a year after the ""[Ruby Ridge Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Ridge?oldformat=true)"" during which a shootout between government agents and a family fleeing the law left a US Marshal, a mother, and a son killed. That event garnered quite a bit of sympathy for the family caught in the crossfire and among certain people, predisposed them against the kind of government ""repression"" that occurred at Waco. Both Ruby Ridge and Waco were precipitated by Firearms charges and involvement by the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms). Given the Second Amendment and the mythology of private gun ownership enabling the American Revolution and protecting ""Liberty,"" the federal government's perceived use of violence to monopolize its control of domestic firearms in these two instances rattled certain segments of the population.   "
72624	0	a	"I will attempt to explain a similar situation in a broad sense, that may illuminate why puzzling public support occurs; there are a LOT of specifics to the Waco standoff that I'm obviously not addressing; I'm just showing a related example and what was learned from it. Mods; if I'm going off the rails I will not be offended if you delete my comments.  My area of study is left-wing European terrorism of the 1970s era. The dominant group active in Europe of this time was the Red Army Faction; commonly called ""The Baader-Meinhof Group.""  Their stated goal was to be the vanguard of a violent revolution, dedicated to retaking the German state on behalf of the people, and ushering in an era of pure socialism. Early in the history of the group they were associated with violence; the serious injury of an elderly library shot when co-leader Andreas Baader was broken out of police custody, weapons training in a Palestinian camp, shootouts with police offers.  And while this was going on, the group was pilloried, along with most leftists, by the conservative Springer Press. Founded by ~~Lord~~ Axel Springer, the Springer Press newspapers were, far and away, the most dominant news outlets in the country, surpassing 50% newspaper readership on Sunday alone. In many ways they were the 1970s German equivalent of the Rupert Murdoch's media empire, only with a much, much larger reach.  So in June of 1971 the [Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach](http://www.ifd-allensbach.de/service/english/summary.html), a very well respected market research and public opinion organization, asked Germans their thoughts on the Baader-Meinhof Group.  Remember, this is a group that has injured people with guns, engaged in shootouts with German police, and spoke openly of their coming violent Revolutionary War in West Germany.  The results were remarkable. 20 percent of Germans under 30 expressed ""a certain sympathy with the group,"" and one in ten young Germans said they'd be willing to shelter a group member for the night. If you tally up all the results, 14 percent of Germans said they'd either be willing to shelter a group member or would be willing to consider it. Essentially 8 million people out of a population of 60 million were either willing to materially support a violent group with the stated goal of revolution, or were willing to consider it.  Now one year later, after the group began their ""war"" in earnest, killing four US soldiers, and maiming several dozen civilians, police officers, and other soldiers over a one month period, that public support essentially ceased to exist (the entire leadership was caught over the next few weeks and imprisoned).  So what was the deal? How could so many people support this group that was so clearly embraced deadly violence? Were people truly supportive of violent revolution?  My research shows that no, people weren't necessarily supportive of violent revolution in practice. But many Germans had an extremely strong belief in Socialism. The upheavals in university campuses during the 1960s across the globe were especially notable in Germany. Students were extremely well-versed in Marxist theory. The dominant left-leaning party, the SPD, had socialist revolution a part of their party platform well into the 1950s. My point is that you had a significant part of the population where the nebulous notion of ""revolution"" was a vague end goal. So when this group comes along saying ""we will be the vanguard of this revolution,"" it was easy to express a certain support of their work, despite their occasional violence. Because this portion of the population had been primed to support the vague goal of Revolution, when asked about this group that was taking baby steps trying to fight for that revolution in the real world, it would have perhaps been more a surprise had they NOT expressed support.  So my takeaway, and how I relate this to the Waco situation (though again, this is NOT my area of study), is that at the time of the Waco standoff, it essentially was a completely unknown situation to the general public prior to the initial deadly shootings that killed several ATF agents and several Branch Davidians. Much like in Germany there was a sizable portion of the US population predisposed to opposition to the US government, the ATF, the FBI, and other agencies; particularly in light of the tragic events at Ruby Ridge the year earlier. So on the news comes word of a standoff, between a group of people, several now dead, who claim they just want to be left alone, and government agents telling stories of meth labs (later shown to be false), unlawful weapons, and stories of child sexual abuse... the people inclined to support the Davidians were just as inclined to discount any information provided by the government.  Another interesting thing happened in Germany; after the bombing campaign of May 1972--their public support completely ceased. BUT... in the coming years many of their original supporters ""returned to the fold"" to an extent. They wouldn't publicly support violence or bombings, but their support morphed into an opposition to how the government was treated the imprisoned terrorists (and the government DID treat many of the terrorists truly terribly).  How I relate this Waco is this: during the siege it was likely VERY easy to discount anything the government was saying, if you were so inclined to disbelieve them. But certainly at some point even the most hardened of these folks likely accepted that Koresh was leading a group where he and others had engaged in sexual abuse of children. But because the government had managed to kill so many of the Davidians, and because the siege was handled so poorly, it trumped any concerns they had about sexual abuse. It's not that they were dismissive of it (though likely many did feel the accusations were made up); it's just that everything else felt so much more important to them.

I'll take from some of my past answer and expand upon them here for your second question. Hopefully this will help and I'll be able to answer whatever follow-ups you have on my breaks. _______ #**What would Muhammad likely have believed?**  While most of Arabia pre-Islam followed locally-based, polytheistic religions, there was a small movement of people called ḥanīfs. Being a ḥanīf essentially entailed in believing in Abrahamic monotheism (as opposed to the standard polytheism of the Arabian Peninsula at the time) but it wasn't a set religious creed. The Arabic root ḥ-n-f in ḥanīf means to incline, so ḥanīf was used in the Qurʾan to signal those who had returned to the monotheism of Abraham away from the idolatry of polytheism.  This sort of monotheism wasn't unknown. There were other figures around Muhammad's time who fell into such beliefs. One of them, the cousin of his first wife Khadija, Waraqah ibn Nawfal, was a hanīf with Christian leanings. Indeed, the fact that the Kaʿba (which became polytheistic pilgrimage center) was claimed to have been built by Abraham and his family meant that there would have been reasons for there to be ḥanīf around Mecca as a whole.  Wael Hallaq, one of the leading scholars on Islamic law, writes within his book The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law that  > Already in Mecca, Muḥammad conceived of himself as a ḥanīf, probably under the influence of a certain Zayd b. ʿAmr. Fundamentally monotheistic, ḥanīfiyya appears to have been a specifically Meccan religious development that was formed around the figure of Abraham and the Kaʿba, which he was believed to have constructed.  The ḥanīf definitely were partial to the other Abrahamic monotheistic faiths. Many of the ḥanīf ended up converting to Christianity (including Khadija's cousin Waraqah bin Nawfal) or, after the Revelation, to Islam. Zayd bin Amr was one of the few who remained fully ḥanīf, without converting to a more established religion.  Ḥanīfs as a whole were not a solifided movement, so they wouldn't have had a clergy. Certain men would preach in the countryside to those who would listen, as Muhammad would do later after the Revelation. Prior to this point, Muhammad would listen to Zayd bin Amr preach, which probably influenced the development of his own branch of monotheism.  Despite not being a solidified movement, the ḥanīfs tended to have some unifying characteristics. In an old paper, Charles Lyall wrote (by which I mean 1903, so methodology has definitely changed) about 3 of these characteristics. The Ḥanīf  > all belonged to the Ḥijāz and the West of the Arabian Peninsula; (2) ... their doctrine was distinct from Christianity, although several of those who professed the Ḥanīfite faith adopted that religion, and was also distinct from Islām; and (3) ... it had certain specific features - rejection of idolatry, abstention from certain kinds of food, and the worship of ""the God of Abraham""; ascetic practices, such as the wearing of sackcloth, are also ascribed to some of the Ḥanīfs (773 - 774).  The ḥanīf are not mentioned in any of the verses concerning the ʿaqd al-dhimma, or contract of protection, that was extended by Muhammad to the People of the Book. The traditional scope of the people of the book were the Jews and the Christians, the two other dominant monotheistic faiths who possessed certain customs, traditions, etc. (Although the definitions gradually expanded, with Zoroastrians, Mandeans, and controversially at times Hindus being included).  Part of this could very well be that there simply weren't many ḥanīfites, and that they were not organized enough to be considered a group worth mentioning. Charles Lyall writes that the word ḥanīf was only used by 2 poets in the time of Muhammad, and they attributed the adjective to only 10 men total (this is when ḥanīf is used to refer to a non-Islamic monotheist. The word can also be paired with the word Muslim to refer to a righteous Muslim). Of course, these are only the men important enough to be mentioned, but it holds that they were often individuals and not entire tribes who held ḥanīfite beliefs, so they wouldn't warrant the same official protections.  _____________ #**On to the second part of your question, how did Islam acquire its respect for the People of the Book?**  As you may known, Islam is an Abrahamic religion.  The Ka'ba in Mecca, the site of the ḥajj pilgrimage, is believed to have been built by Abraham himself as a shrine to Allah. In the Islamic perspective, it was only later that the Ka'ba got coopted by the Arabian polytheists and Muhammad's smashing of the idols was a restoration of its original intent.  Likewise, Judaism and Christianity are also Abrahamic religions.  However, Islam sees itself as being a return to the purity of religion that Judaism and Christianity lost.  This is why you will see many of the same prophets in the three religions - Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and even Jesus appear in the Islamic tradition.  If I recall correctly, Jesus is mentioned by name in the Qur'an more than Muhammad himself is.  Being part of this established tradition was important for Muhammad to develop in the early years of Islam, as links to it gave credence and legitimacy to his movement.  In fact, you'll see many more similarities between Islam and the other Abrahamic religions in the earlier stages of Islam than later.  I'm on the subway now and so don't have access to my books, but Wael Hallaq mentions how the tribes of Yathrib/Medina, where Muhammad was invited to in order to become an arbitrator between the various tribes (including many Jewish tribes), were considered something akin to the ""guardians of monotheism"".  Once Islam was more established and not dependent on the goodwill of these Medinan tribes to exist, Muhammad was able to make some changes that differentiated Islam from Judaism.  For example, the qibla, or direction faced during prayer, was originally Jerusalem instead of Mecca.   In addition to theological links to the other Abrahamic religions, it is important to consider the simple reality of 7th century Arabia.  Although Islam was extremely successful and rapidly grew, incorporating numerous tribes wholesale, they could not fight everyone.  This especially became important with the expansion of Islam out of the Arabian Peninsula itself, when Christian client-states and Client-tribes of the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires joined forces with the nascent Muslim community.    Under the Caliph 'Umar, it was envisioned that Islam would be for the Arabs, who would exist as a sort of military caste above the conquered people who would retain their original religions. For this reason, people were not forced to convert even when militarily conquered. This meant that the conquered populations were disturbed as little as possible, and conversions were only on a voluntary basis. This precedent was set with Muhammed allowing the Jews and Christians of Arabia to keep their religion if they paid the *Jizya* (poll tax). This payment would make a member of the religions of the book - Jews, Christians, and later Zoroastrians - members of the protected class, or *dhimmi*. These people would be reserved from having to pay the Zakat tax and from military service within the empire. This isn't to say that taxes wouldn't get absurdly high though, as Ira Lapidus notes that taxes on peasants could reach upwards of 50% of the value of the goods. It does, however, mean that the Muslim invaders were not hated. Like I said, some Christian tribes had allied themselves with the Muslims against the Sassanians or Byzantines.  This led to the fact that the Religions of the Book flourished in the early days of conquest with Islams coming. Many previously repressed sects were able to abound, and apocalyptic messages were numerous. This changed though as time went on. 'Umar II (r.717-720) forbade Christians to hold powerful government positions. Other successive rulers forbade minority religions to ride horses, bear weapons, or show outward religious symbols in public. Repression came in waves, as one Caliph would crack down (Such as Yazid II destroying churches and animal sculptures) and then others relent. Keep in mind through all of this that from the 7th to the 11th century, upwards of half the world's Christians lived under Islamic rule, yet they were not forced to exile or forced to convert by force (at least in large-scale).  So in summary, one could say that Islam feels a religious affinity for the People of the Book as well as it serving as a useful tool during the later Islamic expansions.  I've got to wrap this up quickly for work.  But I hope this helps and I'll try and answer follow-ups if you have any when I can! "
72640	0	a	"This is an enormously complex topic with a lot of competing and evolving scholarly views, so there's lots of room to say more! In the meantime, our FAQ has a great section on [the Arab world before Islam and the rise of Islam](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/middle_east#wiki_arab_world_before_islam). I'd highlight a few answers in particular:  * [What was the culture and religion of the Arab peninsula before Islam?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1976mo/what_was_the_culture_and_religion_of_the_arabian/c8lfyje/) - by /u/Daeres * [How did Muhammad know so much about Christianity and Judaism?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3jirc1/how_would_muhammad_have_originally_known_so_much/cupo1n5/) - by /u/shlin28  And one other thing I want to highlight about early Islam's interactions with other religions:  Islam is supercessionist with respect to Judaism and Christianity; it incorporate their ideas and says ""Well, they got these parts wrong and we've got past it."" Hence the basic religious-kinship principle. However, Islam has no genetic relationship with a contemporary major Central Asian religion: Zoroastrianism. As early Muslims armies conquered Persia, they often treated Zoroastrians as *dhimmis*, as People of the Book by proxy. The ""Magians"" were not subject to forced conversion campaigns or massacres; their houses of worship were not initially destroyed.   And this idea of applying an existing, tolerated religion to a newly-encountered faith/spirituality gets repeated in later eras of Islamic expansion. African traditional believers in West Africa are sometimes described essentially as Zoroastrians; Hindus are sometimes framed as a variety of ancient Greek pagan (somewhat respectable in Islam thanks to the strong scholarly tradition). In the 13th century, Iranian/Ilkhanate vizier and historian Rashid al-Din actually claims *Buddha* as a prophet of God, in the Islamic tradition, to facilitate interreligious relations and further court Eastern conversion to Islam.   The tolerance of other religions wasn't a guarantee (at some points, such as under the Almohads in North Africa and Iberia, neither was it for Christians or Jews, either...or Muslims perceived as not zealous enough, for that matter). The ruling class of pre-Islamic Persia, specificially, was given the choice to convert to Islam or lose their positions. That's a perfect example, actually--Zoroastrianism had been inseparable from imperial ideology, so converting to Islam also represented a transfer of loyalty to the new caliphate. Thus, when it was *useful*, Muslims found ways to justify the inclusion of other religions even on a theological level.  What this highlights is the importance of *practicality* in the idea of dhimmi status, of Peoples of the Book. It includes, but transcends, the original Abrahamic ties."
72641	0	a	"Student in Middle Eastern Studies here,   As /u/sunagainstgold mentioned below this is an extremely complex topic, but I'll try to explain it in the best way that I can. I'll answer the first question since I'm not sure what you mean with the second one.   ***How was Muhammad raised?***   The main sources for the understanding of the life of Muhammad can be found in the Quran and later sources. This already creates two problems;   * First, there is a very big debate as to the final recession of the Quran. The general assumption is that it was Uthman, the 3rd Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, who ordered that the Quran be collected. The word collected is important, because the Quran is the literal word of God through his messenger Muhammad. If you look at the reign of Uthman (644-656 C.E) you'll see that it was after the death of the Prophet. Added to that there is a chance that the Quran may have been written in order to justify certain policies of the Caliph during that time, we know this because pieces of the Quran were still being found after Uthman ordered the collection of it, which means he might have left some things out voluntarily. Other historians agree that is was Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (646-705 C.E.), the fifth Umayyad caliph who was responsible for the final collection of the Quran. This is also plausible since there is reason to believe that Uthman didn't have the means to achieve such a feat in his time. Plus, the collection of the word of God fits into Abd al-Malik's centralization and unification policies. So even if the Quran can help us understand how the Prophet lived, it was certainly not collected or redacted during his time. Added to that, some passages might have been written to justify certain decisions or events during the reign of the Caliphs.   * The second problems comes with the various later sources (Greek, Hebrew, Armenian and Islamic); they were written after the death of Muhammad. But despite the existence of various sources of different origins, it is virtually impossible to write a somewhat reliable biography of Muhammad. Harald Motzki explains it in *The Biography of Muhammad: The Issue of Sources* as follow: >  "" On the one hand, it is not possible to write a historical biography of the Prophet without being accused of using the sources uncritically, while on the other hand, when using the sources critically, it is simply not possible to write such a biography.”   It is therefore best to regard the story of the life of Muhammad as a work of creative storytellers or myth makers seeking both to understand and to explain The Prophet —and thus themselves—in light of narratives that were part of a shared or common Near Eastern religious, literary, and cultural heritage (Aaron Hughes *Muslim Identities*)  What we do know comes from one of the earliest sources from seventh century Armenian bishop Sebeos,because it seems to confirm what will later be written in Muslim sources. We know that Muhammad existed, that he was a merchant and raised as such to become one and that his eventual preachings were centred around the figure of Abraham.   According to the Islamic tradition, Muhammad was born in 570 C.E. in Mecca. He came from the Banu Hashim, a family within the larger Quraysh tribe. His family was quite important, if not the most powerful within the Quraysh. His parents and grandfatehr died when he was relatively young and so he came under the care of his uncle, Abu Talib. As a teenager, he accompanied his uncle on trading expeditions to Syria which gave him experience in commercial trade. Again, the sources tell us that a Christian monk named Bahira foresaw Muhammad's destiny to become a Prophet, the last Prophet to be precise.   Muhammad later married an older woman and widow by the name of Khadija. When he was about forty he went to the Hira cave (probably thanks to a pre-Islamic custom), where he saw the angel Jibril (Gabriel). This is where, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad's prophetic journey started.   As you can see, answering the first question can prove quite tricky because of the two issues above. I hope however, you understand what I meant in the development of my answer.  As for the second question, I wasn't sure I understood it correctly so I preferred not to answer. I feared it might not have been the answer you were looking for.   If you need more information about the things I said, please, feel free to tell me.   If you want more information on this topic; I highly recommend  * *The Biography of Muhammad: The Issue of Sources* By Harald Motzki (Leiden, Brill, 2000) * *Muslim Identities* By Aaron Hughes (New-York, Columbia University Press, 2013) * *The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates* By Hugh Kennedy (London, Routledge, 2016, third edition)    If you want more information on the Caliphates and the Muslim conquests, Hugh Kennedy is the best I can recommend. Aaron Hughes' book is an excellent way to get to know the Muslim world and it's evolution through the years. From it's origins to 9/11.   "

72649	0	a	Link to the info the PhD student found please?
72650	0	a	"I hope one of our trusted contributors on Finland will show up and go into further detail, especially concerning the debates in Finland this discovery caused but as far as the history of the EK Finland goes, here's what Oula Silvennoinen, the PhD student, discovered:  Silvennoinen shows that the Finnish secret police Valtiollinen Poliisi (Valpo) worked in close cooperation with the German Reich Security Main Office and its predecessor organizations. While he describes several phases of cooperation, in general, the two organizations worked closely together. This was due not only through personal connections such as those of Wenrer Best and Heinrich Müller of Gestapo fame and the second in command of Valpo, Bruno Aaltonen, but also due to ideological affinities. What unite Valpo and the Nazis was anti-Communism.  The anti-communist bend of Valpo contributed according to Silvennoinen majorly to the close cooperation of Valpo and the RSHA, especially in the interrogation, selection, and execution of Soviet POWs in Finnish POW camps. Silvennoinen explains that Finland and with it, Valpo, had due to their own experience first with attempted communist revolution after WWI and after that with Soviet designs on expansion and the declaration of the Winter War, slid more and more towards, what he terms ""anti-Communist democracy"". Valpo was especially affected due to its institutional nature as a secret police engaged in fighting communist and agitators. Due to this ideological affinity Valpo also started more and more to warm towards Nazi anti-Semitism, which saw Jews as responsible for Bolshevism and thus participate in anti-Semitic campaigns of the Nazis.  Silvennoinen's main point concerning Valpo is that at some point the institution started to operate, especially in its collaboration with the RSHA, with only minimal or no knowledge of the democratic government as far as can be told, though he makes the point that further studies would be necessary to illuminate this particular point. Over all however, he draws a picture of a democratic state collborating with the Nazis not because of occupation but because of geopolitical and security political considerations.  Concerning the EK Finland, he shows that the unit, founded in Summer 1941 and dissolved in autumn 1942, did indeed participate in Nazi crimes by selecting up to 3000 people who had been captured by Finnish forces during the continuation war and kept in Finnish POW camps top be shot by the Nazis. He not only shows that ""Jew"" was a specific category for selection but also that the EK Finland did in fact participate in anti-Partisan operations of the Germans, meaning that they were involved in the killing of civilians and Jews, in the Northern Soviet Union.  [The project during the course of which Silvennoinen researched his dissertation](http://www.arkisto.fi/uploads/Palvelut/Julkaisut/POW%20deaths_web.pdf) shows that although Finnish courts did indeed sentence people responsible for the unlawful killing of Soviet POWs, EK Finland did not play a role during these proceedings, which deaths with only 56 cases of unlawful deaths of POWs – a number he terms to be too small.  Silvennoinen's contribution to this volume is especially fascinating since it deals with another of Valpo's tasks: Handing over civilians to the German authorities for either deportation or killing, including political adversaries of Nazi Germany who had fled to Finland. Though this concerned ""only"" 135 cases it still is a chapter in Finish history that has been neglected so far and where one of the most important factors was that this happened in accordance with existing legislation.  Basically, this gives a quick summary of Silvennoinen's points as far as I am familiar with them. His thesis has been published in German but not in English as far as I am aware. I really hope someone might illuminate further on the discussions that arose from his findings within Finnish public discourse.  Edit: I also highly recommend [this article](https://www.google.de/search?q=finland+and+the+holocaust+reassesment&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab&gfe_rd=cr&ei=uLKPWMHVB96E1gL51KaQBQ) going into further detail.

72651	0	a	"The Einsatzkommando that operated in Finland during the ""Continuation War"", as the Finnish component of their involvement is known, was was created as part of the German POW administration. The sources that survive detailing their activities are, unfortunately, scant, which helps explain why their role was so forgotten, but Oula Silvennoinen's work is well regarded, as far as I have read.  A major underpinning of the work, and more importantly, the cooperation of Finnish authorities, came from an agreement made in the fall of 1941 wherein the Finns would turn over ethnic German POWs captured fighting with the Soviets, and in turn the Germans would turn over ethnic Finns. Once turned over to German custody, the Einsatzkommando would interrogate them, and separate them out based on racial and political criteria. Those deemed trustworthy and racially acceptable were sent on their way, while those with some ""defect"" or other were held further. In total, 521 prisoners were handed over categorized as political officers or Communists, of which 47 were Jewish. Unfortunately records do not exist for just how many of them were eventually killed by the Einsatzkommando, but eyewitness testimony puts the numbers in the hundreds.  Now, to be sure, the Finns were not in the dark about the possible fate of those prisoners being turned over to German custody. Again there is a paucity of evidence as the Finns certainly tried to keep such matters quiet both during and after the war, but it is not completely gone. In one particularly damning statement, Colonel Sulo Malm, who was in charge of Finnish POW arrangements, had mentioned to the military attaché in Stockholm of “the handing over of Russian politruks and [political] commissars to the Germans in Salla, where they were killed by the Germans.""  Now, as for how these revelations played out once published in 2008, well... it had little impact in Finland, where it seems most people preferred to ignore it and not let the new evidence cloud the general view of Finnish participation in the war - ""co-belligerents, not allies!"" as I many a Finn would likely make sure to stress. Although it predates the revelations, this excerpt from President Tarja Halonen's 2005 address is a fair illustration of the view that I reference:  >In late summer 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union agreed on a division of Europe into spheres of influence. The following winter Finland had to fight off an attack by the Red Army in order to preserve her independence and avoid being occupied by the Soviet Union. We had to do this alone, without significant outside help. Five years later, in the summer of 1944, we again managed to stop the Red Army’s attempts to conquer Finland. Our country was not occupied at any stage, during or a er the war. We lost part of our territory, but we achieved a defensive victory.  With the Finnish academic community, certainly, it had some impact, and helped to solidify the view that most Finnish historians hold which runs counter to the ""neo-patriotic master narrative of war"" seen above, but calls outside the academy for reevaluation of the public consciousness of the war are few, and fall on deaf ears. But even what impact there has been hasn't always been as full-throated as one might hope. While, as noted, the publication *did* have influence with war historians, while *other* countries - at least those that even took notice - focused on the revelations of complicity in genocide - the headline in Sweden's *Dagens Nyheter* was simply “**Finland participated in the Holocaust**"", *that* aspect seems to have had little play even within the academy, and instead Finnish historians prefered to concentrate on it as strong evidence against the 'separate war thesis.'  -----  Kinnunen, Tiina, and Ville Kivimäki.

72655	0	a	Well, official Finnish policy, including turning to the Germans almost certainly had the component of Finland having been and at the time (as the winter war shows) the object of Russian and at the time Soviet expansionism.   For Valpo though and also other parts of the Finnish state apparatus and society, anti-Communsim was also an important factor in as far, the memory of the Finnish Civil War lay not too far in the past. Among the many conflicts that arose from the end of WWI and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, the Finnish Civil War between Reds, i.e. communist forces supported by the Soviet Union from whom Finland just had become independent, and Whites, i.e. more conservative and other elements in Finnish society.  Like almost all these conflicts that arose from the end of WWI, the Finnish Cicil War can be accurately describe in the scope used by Robert Gerwarth in his book *The Vanquished*, namely that these were wars that continued with the brutality of WWI but said brutality went unchecked by national governments or other mediating authority.  With the victory of White forces, their violence was quickly tried to be swept under the rug but the considerable brutality exacted by Red Forces was remembered, especially by members of the state apparatus and can in its impact on collective memory be compared to the failed revolutions in Germany or the Austrian Civil War of 1934, in effect dividing Finnish society for years to come and fermenting considerable anti-Communism among its populace and especially its national elites.

72657	0	a	"Good question! [I answered this a few years back,](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/35h1f0/did_ancient_roman_women_shave_their_legs_armpits/) but it was a fun topic so I'll pull that answer back in to play and polish it up to my current standards.

Considering that *The Art of Love* is essentially a mock guide for teaching men and women how to get laid (emphasis here: it's satirical), it's got some hilarious stuff in there, if you want to give it a read :) However, this small section already does note that Roman women did distinguish themselves with depilation, and the most common ways they would accomplish this was with either plucking (generally with tweezers, eyebrows were also plucked), razors (not always the most desirable option, because the razors of the time had the unlucky tendency of leaving lots of nicks), and, the biggest one, rubbing your skin with pumice to remove unwanted hair, which honestly also sounds incredibly uncomfortable.

[Are mosaics cheating?](https://i.imgur.com/xmjdH6G.jpg)  If you click through those, there's a pattern that does make itself clear - there's no body hair on any of the women in question, which does lend itself to the idea of depilation.   So how about men? Well, we *also* have attestation for that, from multiple sources. The more entertaining one is gonna be Martial *Epigrammata* IX, 27: (quick translation):   > You have epilated testicles, Chrestus, and a cock that's like a vulture's neck, and a head smoother than a prostitute's ass, and there is not a single hair on your thighs, and merciless tweezers groom your bloodless lips. And you only talk about Curius, Camillus, Quintius, Numa, Ancus, and every sort of hairy thing that we might read about, and you are loud and threatening with grand words, and you argue with the theatres and with the present time. If some other butt-boy (sodomite) should come along, now that he's free from his teacher, and whose throbbing cock has been unleashed by the artisan, you, calling him with a nod, lead him off; and Chrestus, it shames me to say what you do with your Catonian tongue.^1  ...*ahem*. Filthy Latin poetry aside, you get the idea. In slightly...tamer Latin, Suetonius gives lascivious accounts of Julius Caesar (of stabbity fame), giving a very specific nod to his....wanton ways:  > He was somewhat overnice in the care of his person, being not only carefully trimmed and shaved, but even having superfluous hair plucked out, as some have charged; while his baldness was a disfigurement which troubled him greatly, since he found that it was often the subject of the gibes of his detractors. Because of it he used to comb forward his scanty locks from the crown of his head, and of all the honours voted him by the senate and people there was none which he received or made use of more gladly than the privilege of wearing a laurel wreath at all times. They say, too, that he was remarkable in his dress; that he wore a senator's tunic with fringed sleeves reaching to the wrist, and always had a girdle over it, though rather a loose one; and this, they say, was the occasion of Sulla's mot, when he often warned the nobles to keep an eye on the ill-girt boy.  Finally, the job of ""hair plucker"" was a literal job. Seneca mentions depilation a few times in his *Moral Epistles*. First off, in his letter that's best summed up as ""don't treat your slaves like shit. They're people too.""  > Another, who serves the wine, must dress like a woman and wrestle with his advancing years; he cannot get away from his boyhood; he is dragged back to it; and though he has already acquired a soldier’s figure, he is kept beardless by having his hair smoothed away or plucked out by the roots, and he must remain awake throughout the night, dividing his time between his master’s drunkenness and his lust; in the chamber he must be a man, at the feast a boy.  (A small reminder, Roman slavery was horrible. The above example is a small sample size of many, many horrors. Sen. *Epistulae*. 47.)  Then, in a slightly less grim context... (describing the noises that disturb the person who rents out an apartment above a bath - *Ep.* 57):  > Then, perhaps, a professional a comes along, shouting out the score; that is the finishing touch. Add to this the arresting of an occasional roysterer or pickpocket, the racket of the man who always likes to hear his own voice in the bathroom, or the enthusiast who plunges into the swimming-tank with unconscionable noise and splashing. **Besides all those whose voices, if nothing else, are good, imagine the hair-plucker with his penetrating, shrill voice,—for purposes of advertisement,—continually giving it vent and never holding his tongue except when he is plucking the armpits and making his victim yell instead.** Then the cake-seller with his varied cries, the sausageman, the confectioner, and all the vendors of food hawking their wares, each with his own distinctive intonation.  So yeah, the Romans plucked, pruned, shaved, groomed, and did what they thought looked pretty. Grouchier conservative voices would squawk about how gay it was, and the youth would wholeheartedly agree, making gay jokes at each other while getting their armpits plucked.   If you have any questions, feel free to let me know!  --------  1: *Cum depilatos, Chreste, coleos portes   Et uulturino mentulam parem collo   Et prostitutis leuius caput culis,   Nec uiuat ullus in tuo pilus crure,   Purgentque saeuae cana labra uolsellae ;   Curios, Camillos, Quintios, Numas, Ancos,   Et quidquid unquam legimus pilosorum   Loqueris sonasque grandibus minax uerbis,   Et cum theatris saeculoque rixaris.   occurrit aliquis inter ista si draucus,   iam paedagogo liberatus et cuius   refibulavit turgidum faber penem,   nutu vocatum ducis, et pudet fari    Catoniana, Chreste, quod facis lingua.*    I translated this one because it's hilarious, the other two, I just borrowed from the Loeb translations.

Removing pubic hair (and armpit hair) was considered very routine in Arabia at that time. Both for men and women.  Al-Bukhari narrated in his book [\(Hadith no.: 5889\)](http://www.gowister.com/hadith/bukhari/5771/) and Muslim narrated in his book [\(Hadith no.: 257\)](https://sunnah.com/muslim/2/64) that Prophet Muhammad (570 - 632 CE) (PBUH) said: ""The natural instincts are five: circumcision, shaving pubic hair, cutting the mustache, cutting nails and plucking armpit hair."" So, it was not only thought to be something that is recommended religiously but it was looked upon as part of basic instinctual human hygiene.  Also, [Al-Bukhari \(5247\)](http://www.gowister.com/hadith/bukhari/5134/) and [Muslim \(715\)](https://sunnah.com/muslim/17/73) narrated that Jaber ibn Abdullah (died 697 CE) said: ""We were once with the Prophet in a battle, and when we returned back to Medina, we went to enter (the city). The Prophet said: Let us wait and enter (the city) after nightfall, so that women with unkempt hair can have time to fix their hair, and those whose husbands were away can have time to shave their pubic hair."" We can deduce from that that it was routine for women to shave their pubic hair in preparation to meet their husbands.  [Al-Bukhari \(3989\)](http://www.gowister.com/hadith/bukhari/3908/) also narrates a long story about a man called Khubaib ibn Adiy (died early 7th century) that has a part where he was captured by some non-muslim enemies, and they were about to kill him so he asked them to lend him a shaving razor, so that he can shave his pubic hair before they kill him, and they did lend him the razor. This can show that not only was it routine for men to shave their pubic hair, but it was also considered more dignified to die clean shaven.  On another note, most people used to pluck their armpit hair instead of shaving, although there has been reports that some people would find it very painful and would shave instead, but I'll keep the sources for other time not to derail the main discussion.    "
72659	0	a	This is FASCINATING, and an amazing job of pulling together all these sources, but I have one question—is it possible that the media of the day focused on hairless, much like porn of now does the same? I don’t have a dog in the fight, I personally like being hairless myself, but seeing how bleached bits and even labioplasty are sometimes seen in recorded media, specifically, how accurate might these depictions be to real life at the time, I wonder?   In either case, this was a wonderful historical look at a VERY specific question, so thank you!!
72660	0	a	Does the practice of removing hair in male servants correspond to making them appear younger and more boy-like? Or was it purely aesthetic?
72661	0	a	"Thank *you*! :) With regards to your question, it's entirely possible - obviously, we don't have nearly the amount of insight into the ancient world as we would love to (read: more than a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the things that were written and drawn). That being said, the first thing that comes to my mind (pardon my upcoming language) is a bit of graffiti from Pompeii (CIL 04, 3961):  *Restutus / Restetuta / pone tunica(m) / rogo pudes / pilosa(m) c<u>(nnum)*  Or, translated:  > Restutus: Restetuta, drop your tunic - I want you to be ashamed of your hairy cunt.  Woo, ancient catcalling. Just as fun as the modern stuff, but some guy thought it was funny to write this one out. Kinda like a bathroom stall, if you think about it.  Pubic hair was certainly a thing, but from the *very* limited source material we have, it seems like....it came down to personal preference. There are *plenty* of ""bush"" references in Roman literature. "
72662	0	a	"All of the above. Pederasty/pedophilia is not a new thing, and, while the Romans looked down on the practice much more than their Greek counterparts (a common slur against an unpopular emperor was to say that they diddled little boys), it still happened, especially among the wealthy. That being said, however, if said man ""allowed"" himself to be the bottom, it was a bigger slight on him (as the penetrated) than on the guy on top (the penetrator, which is the manly position, apparently). Another slight that's used against people is to accuse them of ""bottoming"" (see: Caesar. Suetonius hints at it, Catullus says it straight out, etc).   Either way - it could be an aesthetic to make them more boyish, or it could be a personal aesthetic preference. I think saying more than that risks blanketing all Romans with a big ol' blanket, rather than treating them as individuals, however unhelpful that answer may be :) "
72663	0	a	Nah, Roman women had underwear. The bottoms at least were made of leather, from what we can tell (going by [artwork depicting women exercising](https://i.imgur.com/sg1haNf.jpg) and the fact that [we've found one](https://i.imgur.com/wOk8uUX.jpg)). The obvious problem with this assumption is that we've...well...only got one (leather and other fabrics only survive in an anaerobic environment). And a sample size of one would make any statistics person roll their eyes and explain how it's impossible to make any statistical assumptions from it. The breast bands were made of fabric (Though Martial 14.66 jokes about using a leather one) and effectively were used in the same way that sports bras are today - to keep things from bouncing all over the place when doing a strenuous bit of working out. Why are they in a sex scene? We're not 100% sure, but it could be an allusion to her doing all the work. 
72664	0	a	"Ah, fun catch! (And this scene made it into Byzantine pop culture, too. If Procopius is to be believed - he isn't - Theodora, future empress of Constantinople, re-enacted this scene on the streets in her acting days. In front of large crowds)  This is from Leda and the Swan - a story featuring our favourite rapey bestiality god, Zeus. Er, Jupiter. Er, Zoopiter. I like that last one best. Anyway, the story goes that Zeus, looking around one day and feeling rather horny (as he does), espied a lovely queen of Sparta. She being pretty, he swooshed himself into swan form and, summoning his *actual* spirit animal of an eagle to chase him, he ""fled"" and allowed himself to be ""rescued"" by Leda, the queen. They promptly had sex, which sounds like every porn plot ever, and he flew off afterwards (still swan), after which Leda's husband came in. Not to be deterred, Leda slept with him, too. From this....adventure, she bore four children:   Castor and Pollux, the twins who are more commonly known as the *Gemini* (yes, the constellation), who were also the patron gods of sailors and navigation;   Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife, eventually murders him, marries his cousin, is murdered by her son....you know, standard Greek tragedy things;   and finally, last but CERTAINLY not least, Helen of Sparta, also known as Helen of Troy, the face who launched a thousand ships.   Fun story, makes for great artwork. The Romans loved depicting it, it's *everywhere*. And, considering that they saw the Trojan War as directly leading to the founding of Rome, the act that started it all is kind of important, no? :) "

72667	0	a	"There's a benefit to taking the time to look up the original Latin - oftentimes, especially with more...coarse language (or just sometimes in general), online translations are either coy or just plain suck. I was going to use that particular translation - the one on the pompeiana site, I believe? - but I got curious as to the actual verbiage. To find this one (CIL 04.3961), I wasn't quite sure of the Latin used, so I went to one of the [online databases](http://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epi.php?s_sprache=en), which are *obnoxiously* hard to find at the best of times, entered ""Pompei"" in the ""place"" box (I'd link directly, but this site is...not optimized and doesn't allow for that), sighed a little bit when I saw the ""15,000 entries"" bit (and yet was utterly unsurprised), and scrolled down till I found the above. It's much more useful if you can somewhat sight read the Latin, but a lot of the random graffiti on there is quite self explanatory! (sadly, the site doesn't have access to a pic of this particular bit of graffiti, but sometimes it does!)"
72668	0	a	Is it weird that I can actually answer this, to some degree? There's one example in literature that immediately comes to mind - and it even comes with a book recommendation! The one (complete) surviving Roman novel, a work called *The Metamorphoses* - or, generally *The Golden Ass*, by Apuleius, aside from being a hilarious and fantastic read, does have a relevant scene of a slave woman with a bare pubis. I'll quote it for you here:  > Without a moment’s delay she whipped away all the dinner dishes, stripped herself of all her clothes, and let down her hair. With joyous wantonness she beautifully transformed herself into the picture of Venus rising from the ocean waves. For a time she even held one rosy little hand in front of her smooth-shaven pubes, purposely shadowing it rather than modestly hiding it.   ...Unless I've misunderstood your question and you're asking about the sexual assault of young girls and female slaves, to which I'll confirm that this, too, was a thing. The underage boys generally get more attention, but there are allusions to underage girls being assaulted as well, such as in Suetonius' *Claudius* 35, where he implies that Claudius only reluctantly gave up watching young boys and girls being strip searched. The rape of slaves goes without being said - slaves, as property, had no power to consent (or not). It's generally understood that Roman (male) aristocrats generally lost their virginity to the household slaves during their teenage years.   ....unless I'm misunderstanding your question even *more* about the penetration thingy. In which case, oral sex on a woman was indeed considered shocking and shameful, since it put the man in a submissive position.   Hope this helped!
72669	0	a	I don’t see that there’s any other answer than ‘it depends’. More particularly, it depends on why your teacher has decided to frame the Second World War in this way.  I’m coming at this from a perspective of someone who studies (and teaches) a conflict whose relationship to the Second World War is quite debatable. A classic exam-style question for college students who study modern European history is ‘Was the Spanish Civil War the opening phase of the Second World War?’. It’s asked not because there is a right or wrong answer, but because it depends entirely on how you define the crucial issues at stake, and you can make a valid argument either way. For instance, if the Second World War is defined as an anti-fascist war, then it makes sense to view Spain as the beginning of this wider conflict; the opening blows in a wider ideological war. But if the Second World War is about something else – not least because the war in Asia and the Pacific doesn’t map neatly into a fascist/anti-fascist divide – then it no longer makes sense to view Spain as part of the same conflict. Your exam answer depends entirely on the frame of reference you want to adopt.  In this case, I can think of several reasons why someone might want to frame the conflict in the ways that your teacher wanted to. For instance, in terms of simple arithmetic, these are the theatres that saw the highest numbers of deaths. For both Germany and Japan, I believe there’s a case to be made that these were considered the most important fronts to achieve their aims, and generally saw the largest allocation of resources, though I’d gladly defer to an expert on either war effort on the extent this held true over time. Equally, there are reasons why it’s spurious – the influence of the United States, especially in terms of industrial production, was far too large to entirely discount in this way. The territory and populations that were won and lost in the ‘comparatively small’ conflicts were massive by any reasonable standard, and those that suffered occupation, displacement, exploitation and extermination could justifiably challenge any version of the conflict that so blithely downplayed their experiences.  But more importantly, I think, there’s a pedagogical case to be made for radically reframing the conflict for students. I don’t think any conflict has been the subject of national myth-making to the extent that the Second World War has, from the Battle of Britain, to Omaha Beach, to the French Resistance and more. There is a tendency to emphasise certain national perspectives, which in turn often leads to distorted impressions of how the war was won or lost. Challenging students’ understanding of what was important about the Second World War, going beyond the frame of reference that is provided in popular culture and high school history, is a useful way of showing students that things can look very different from perspectives other than the ones we grew up with. In other words, showing that studying history is not just about memorising dates and events, but being critical and flexible in how we approach the past.  Tl;dr: if your professor has presented this view as divine truth, then there are many reasons to question it. But if, as seems more likely, they are challenging you to rethink the way you’ve framed the Second World War up until now, then they're just doing their job.

Thanks for your response, it helps me contextualize what he said a lot and balance it against by own biases stemming from the time and place I was born.
72671	0	a	Man I really wish you taught my classes in college, I absolutely love that response. 
72672	0	a	Brilliant write up there.  I must admit that I never gave the Spanish Civil War much thought within the context of WWII, mainly coming down to the fact that Francoist Spain didn’t contribute much to the “actual” conflict; probably didn’t help that my teacher in high school planted the conflict within the ‘interwar years’.  Perfectly showcases your point in challenging perspectives.  My teacher instead relied on the ‘starting date’ debate to challenge the “Eurocentric” perspective (went to school in Hong Kong); the two dates given were pretty uncontroversial imo, being Marco Polo Bridge and Pearl Harbor.  If I recall correctly high school me rejected both dates, using Lend-Lease against Pearl Harbor in measuring US involvement in the conflict, and that the “Chinese Theatre” alone can’t justify calling it a ‘World War’.  Of course that doesn’t necessarily legitimize 1st September 1939, but I’m cutting high school me some slack, and blame my teacher for only giving me 3 dates to choose from.  Your point in national myth-making did get me curious though: did the Spanish themselves connect the civil war to the wider global conflict?
72673	0	a	I'm very glad it was useful! Hopefully some actual Second World War experts can weigh in on the specific claim a bit more as well.
72674	0	a	Brb while I steal this quote to use at my next job interview. Thanks!
72675	0	a	That is actually a really interesting question, which might be better asked as it's own thread. Without wanting to make a habit of falling back on this answer... it depends. Certainly, during the civil war many Spaniards could see that their conflict reflected Europe's ideological divisions in the late 1930s, and could readily understand Soviet, German and Italian intervention in those terms. During the Second World War itself, though, the answer gets a lot more complicated, and would reflect again the different ways that various groups of Spaniards understood the wider conflict. The Republican exiles, for instance, who joined the French resistance (or, later, the Free French or other Allied forces), could easily understand this as a continuation of their earlier struggle, and hoped that Allied victory would mean overthrowing Franco. Equally, the Spaniards who volunteered to fight for the Blue Division on the eastern front could frame this as a continuation of their crusade against Bolshevism. Yet even these two perspectives present contradictory interpretations of the Second World War, with the Western Allies representing an ambiguous entity that was either engaged in an anti-fascist (and by extension, anti-Francoist) war, or a bloc which an anti-communist regime could negotiate with.

72686	0	a	"For the early part of the war, Thucydides is effectively our only source. We have other historical accounts in the shape of Diodoros' universal history, as well as Plutarch's *Lives* of prominent Athenians like Perikles, Nikias and Alkibiades - but the details of these accounts show that they are derived from Thucydides. They preserve little of an alternative tradition that allows us to criticise Thucydides. Epigraphic and archaeological material doesn't help much either, since there is much less of this for the 5th century BC than there is for the 4th. We do have a lot of pictorial evidence to suggest the type of armour and weapons used.  Thucydides' account breaks off mid-sentence during his account of the events of 410 BC. Many ancient authors took up the baton to continue the story, and the one that survives is Xenophon's *Hellenika*, which finishes the narrative of the Peloponnesian War and goes on describing Greek affairs down to 362 BC. For this later period, we do have some alternative accounts to compare against each other.  > have anyone found weapons, armor and other remains that are definitively from these battles?  We mostly rely on temple dedications to find weapons, and these are much less numerous for the Classical period than they are for earlier times. That said, there are certainly weapons that can be identified as tools of the Peloponnesian War. Most prominently, a [shield](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/24/0e/71/agora.jpg) was found in a well on the Athenian *agora* that was helpfully inscribed with the words ""taken from the Lakedaimonians at Pylos"" - a trophy from the battle of Pylos/Sphakteria (425 BC), Athens' most important victory of the war. Because Thucydides tells us that the Spartan commander Brasidas lost his shield in this battle, the shield found at Athens is sometimes corlourfully claimed to be the shield of Brasidas."
72687	0	a	"This sounds like a lot of fun :) It's great to see kids interested, and I assure you, the forming of pro-Athenian and pro-Spartan factions happens at all ages.  Obviously war is a difficult topic to teach children, especially since most of what the general accounts don't tell you is more harrowing than what they do. And the story of the Peloponnesian War is a fairly relentless tragedy that has little in the way of fun and games. But since they're already falling into factions, I would probably focus on the funny anecdotes you get to confirm the stereotypes the Athenians and Spartans had of each other - like Thucydides saying of Brasidas that ""he was a pretty good speaker, *for a Spartan*"", or Sthenelaidas the Spartan saying after a long Athenian speech that he wouldn't pretend to have understood it. And of course the character of Alkibiades, who betrayed both sides, should be a source of some amusement - there are many fascinating over-the-top factoids about him in Plutarch's *Life of Alkibiades* which you can find [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a2008.01.0006)."
72688	0	a	"People talk less about Thebes for the same reason they talk less about Austria-Hungary in WW1: our main narrative, and our understanding of the chief players on each side, pushes them to the margin. It was the Theban attempt to seize Plataiai (an ally of Athens) that triggered the war, but after that, Sparta played the main role in organising campaigns against Athens. Thebes mostly acted as their frontline proxy and cavalry support. During the second half of the war, which was mainly focused on naval campaigns, Thebes played even less prominent a part because it had no navy.  That said, people certainly talk about Thebes both during the war (because of the major defeat they inflicted on Athens at Delion in 424 BC) and in the history of the early 4th century BC, when they briefly rose to supremacy in mainland Greece. While pop culture has largely forgotten him, the Theban general Epameinondas, who decisively defeated the Spartans at Leuktra in 371 BC, was one of the most admired leaders of Antiquity; Cicero called him ""the greatest of all the Greeks""."
72689	0	a	Women were hugely important to the daily realities of Greek warfare, simply because there were no professional armies; all military forces consisted of the male population (citizen, non-citizen and enslaved) in arms. As a result, when the army was out in force, there were far fewer people left to do the things required to keep society running - working the fields, making clothes and food, running estates, and so on. The importance of women to the war effort is brought out especially by the fact that the garrison that was chosen to hold the town of Plataiai against the Spartan siege included not just warriors, but also 120 women, whose specific task was to feed the warriors and tend to their wounds. While women would normally only engage in combat in exceptional situations (such as siege assaults on their home towns), they played a vital role in the logistics, supply and medical care of armies.   In addition, they were not just the stakes of the fighting (with women and children of captured settlements facing untold horrors of assault and enslavement) but also the audience for the army's actions. We hear of several cases where the scorn of those who didn't fight was the determining factor for those who did. Gender roles were very strictly defined in Classical Greece, and women tended to be categorically excluded from the role of the warrior - but this in itself proved a huge moral force, because women's judgment of the behaviour of men as men (as well as the judgment of other men regarding whether or not men had acted in a manly way) was directly connected to some of the central values of Greek society, like shame and competition for honour.
72690	0	a	There's not much that we can definitely say about cultural change during the war; it had long been the tendency of the Athenian democracy to grow ever more self-confident, and for the Athenian elite to resist this by affecting Spartan fashions and Spartan sympathies. The greatest shock to Athenian society wasn't the long conflict or the final defeat, but the reign of terror unleashed on them afterwards by the Spartan puppet regime known as the Thirty. The atmosphere of terror, and the exiles, confiscations and executions carried out in the name of this regime, made life for Athenians a living hell, and one source claims that as many as 1500 citizens were killed by the oligarchs in less than a year. After the Thirty were overthrown, there was a backlash against the very notion of oligarchy (and everything associated with it) that lasted for generations. Sokrates did his civic duty throughout the war, but was finally accused of corrupting Athens mainly because he had been the tutor of Kritias, one of the ringleaders of the Thirty.
72691	0	a	"> How much of naval combat was ship on ship actions like ramming? There were obviously people on the vessels but how much of an impact did archers, marines, etc. play in the grand scheme of a battle?  The two forms of naval combat existed side by side, with Thucydides (probably wrongly) describing boarding action as old-fashioned and ramming as innovative and sophisticated. The main thing was that ramming tactics required room to manoeuvre, as well as carefully managed formations to prevent confusion. It was typically the prerogative of well-trained crews in open-sea battles. In tighter quarters such as harbours or inlets, boarding was a more likely approach. The Athenians, who prided themselves on their naval expertise, had fairly lightly crewed triremes with just 4 archers and 10 deck-fighters; other states sometimes crammed 30 or more fighting men on their decks. Both during ramming and boarding, missile troops on deck played an important role in harassing and picking off their counterparts on the enemy's ships and ideally being a nuisance to the rowers in the hull.  > Are there any actual records of giant melees in battles that weren’t a rout?  Giant melees were a Very Bad Thing if they occurred in battle, because they meant a total loss of oversight and control. Most hand-to-hand combat occurred along the line of opposing formations. Only rarely, in the case of encirclements or confused fighting, would Greek warriors face enemies on multiple sides in chaotic melee. In these cases, ""friendly fire"" was a common occurrence and panic was likely to result. "
72692	0	a	This is a complex question simply because of how long the war lasted and how different the situation was at different times. During the first part of the war (431-421 BC), it seems Athens didn't really have a plan to win; Perikles' strategy was simply to hold on to what Athens had, and thus prove that the Spartans were powerless to enforce their claim to supremacy in Greece. Since the Athenian empire still existed in 421 BC, the Athenians pretty much succeeded there, and may be said to have won the war up to that point.   But then they got cocky, and committed repeated acts of hubris to provoke Sparta into further conflict. They also tried and failed to conquer Sicily in 415-413 BC, which cost them half their fleet and a good chunk of money and manpower. When Sparta decided that fair enough, it *was* time for a second round, Athens was already at a disadvantage.   Even so, they were able to hold their own against Spartan efforts to tear apart their empire for 8 years (413-405 BC). They had several major naval victories and were able to restore much of the territory that rebelled in 412 BC. Even Spartan success at acquiring Persian funding for their fleet did not initially decide the issue. The final problem was mainly attrition: Athens may have repeatedly defeated Sparta at sea, but the Persians would simply pay for a new fleet, and this game of Aegean whack-a-mole only exhausted Athens' coffers and manpower reserves. When Lysander attacked the Athenian fleet by surprise at Aigospotamoi in 405 BC, it was their own carelessness that proved decisive - but even if they had won again, their final defeat was only a matter of time.
72693	0	a	We don't really know, and there are different theories. The one raised by the Greeks themselves is that Sparta thought it unrighteous to destroy a state that had done so much for Greece during the Persian Wars. We don't need to be too skeptical of this, as political reasoning based on tradition and stories was common enough in Greek interstate politics. Nevertheless, we can also suspect some other motives.  The most commonly cited theory is that the Spartans were afraid of the growing power of Thebes, and worried that razing Athens would effectively grant Thebes dominance of Attika as well, doubling their territory and greatly increasing their resources. This may be a bit anachronistic, but the idea that Sparta was playing balance-of-power politics isn't that hard to believe.  An alternative raised by Anton Powell is that the decision resulted from internal Spartan politics. The great victor of the Peloponnesian War was a Spartan bastard named Lysander (bastard in the sense that he was the offspring of an illegitimate relationship and not a full citizen). His influence in the many states he liberated gave him unprecedented power in the Greek world, and there were rumours that he had plans to overthrow the Spartan kings and rule Sparta himself. The Spartan kings, led by Pausanias, Lysander's chief rival, reasoned that the proceeds of razing Athens would primarily benefit Lysander, and that it would be better to preserve Athens as a key protectorate of the kings themselves.
72694	0	a	It may seem unprofessional for a historian, but if we're honest with ourselves (as I tell my students whenever I teach this subject), none of us are neutral in the Peloponnesian War. There are good reasons to cast either side as the noble defender against oppression; there are also good reasons to cast either side as an imperialist aggressor. There's even a whole scholarly debate about who was actually to blame for starting the war!  My sympathies, instinctively, are with the democracy, the cosmopolitan outlook and the brazen self-confidence of Athens. But it is good practice not to let it affect my interpretation of the sources or the war.
72695	0	a	Funnily enough, it doesn't seem to have affected the outcome of the war. Athens suffered enormously from the plague, probably losing as much as a third of its population - but even despite those losses, they remained the most populous Greek state in terms of the number of its citizens. It undermined their confidence and morale in the early years of the war (even leading to an aborted attempt to secure a peace treaty in 430 BC), but they seem to have recovered them soon after. They continued their campaigning throughout the plague years, and were given some respite from Spartan attacks because the Spartans refused to enter the affected territory. In the end, despite the huge death toll of the plague (which included Perikles himself), Athens won the first phase of the war, negotiating a mostly favourable peace treaty with Sparta in 421 BC that affirmed the status quo. By 415, according to Thucydides, the population was starting to recover.  In short, the plague was a huge disaster that greatly reduced Athenian manpower, but the war raged on afterwards, and initially mostly in Athens' favour.
72696	0	a	"I was surprised to see this once again in AC:Odyssey! It's pretty much groundless. True, Spartan citizens wore a uniform red garment called the *phoinikê* (""the Phoenician one""), named after the origin of its red dye. They sometimes extended this habit also to others fighting in their ranks. But it didn't affect the colour of their other clothes, or of their ships, or anything else. The Athenians are made to be blue pretty much just for contrast; there are no historical grounds for this whatsoever."
72697	0	a	The problem here is the mismatch between historical armour, which tends to exist in just a few styles without notable differences in effectiveness, and the desire to have a clear system in which the player can level up their equipment. The result is that most games either introduce an arbitrary progression from bad to better armour (usually leather -> linen -> bronze -> iron, or something like that), or introduce fantasy armour. It makes sense from a game design standpoint, but obviously has little to do with historical reality.  This reality, as far as we can tell, is that by the time of the Peloponnesian War very few Greek hoplites would have worn body armour of any kind. This applies to both sides in the conflict. Most depictions of warriors at the time show them with a simple conical helmet and a shield, and no other armour. They would wear a simple tunic in battle; for Spartans, the tunic was dyed red. Greaves may still have been common, but the only kind of cuirass that would be frequently worn was the linen cuirass known as the *linothorax*, and even this may have been rare. Bronze armour had all but gone out of style, and was mostly the prerogative of cavalry, which carried no shield.  I wrote in more detail about the lightening of the hoplite panoply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5tvsl6/a_question_on_armor_in_the_late_archaicearly/ddpnaqs/).

It's been a source of endless speculation as to why Thucydides didn't finish his work (and how finished it really is - there's a big school of thought that says all of the final book is just a rough draft). We don't really know; the most likely is that he fell ill at the end of his life and died before he could complete it.

72702	0	a	They would be able to pursue whatever profession they liked, of course, so long as they could provide for themselves. After all, there were few professional warriors in Ancient Greece, and even the manliest men would only be part-time warriors; it would be impossible to arrange an entire society around the idea that men were *only* warriors (which was not remotely the case even in Sparta). There were only a few specific activities that were overtly linked to gender roles. The most prominent examples are that men were warriors and women were not-warriors, while women were weavers and men were not-weavers.
72703	0	a	Absolutely, Athenian democracy was paid for by the extraction of wealth from hundreds of smaller communities that were not allowed to break away from the Empire on pain of annihilation. On the other hand, Athens mostly encouraged the spread of democratic regimes within its empire, and there's an argument that outsourcing its defence to Athens for a modest annual fee allowed many member states to live in peace for fairly uncommon lengths of time.
72704	0	a	Due to their relatively large territory (Attika is about the size of modern Luxembourg), they were already one of the largest Greek states at the time of the Persian Wars, fielding 9000 hoplites at Marathon and 8000 at Plataiai. The rest was due partly to a half century of explosive economic growth since the Persian Wars, and partly (probably) due to the naturalisation of a lot of immigrants and children of mixed marriages early in the 5th century. The citizen population was drastically reduced in 451 BC with Perikles' Citizenship Law (which decreed that only the children of two citizen parents could be citizens), but even that doesn't seem to have made a dent in the overall spectacular growth of the Athenian population, to an estimated maximum of about 60,000 adult male citizens in 431 BC.
72705	0	a	Certainly, because he wrote repeatedly how long the war went on. He couldn't have known it would be a 27-year war until he lived through all 27 years and saw it end. We don't know exactly when he died - sometime between 404 and 395 BC - but the point is not that he didn't finish the work because he hadn't observed the rest of the war, just that he ran out of time to write his account.

72707	0	a	Having worked as a guide and educator at my local cathedral restoration works for almost a decade, I find the news from Paris almost too horrific to contemplate.   [This picture](https://twitter.com/alex_fremont/status/1117883912632430593), posted by journalist Alexandre Fremont, shows the extent of the devastation, while also illustrating how a cathedral roof fire has the potential to wreck the overall structure. I'm not familiar with the exact nature of the 19th century restoration work carried out on the uper levels of Notre Dame, but most or all of the roof will likely have been carried on an open framework of massive wooden beams. Once a fire gets hold of these it is very difficult to put out, since the wood will be tinder dry after decades (or centuries), there are no natural or artificial firebreaks, and there is plenty of oxygen available to fan the flames. Falling embers and burning beams will almost inevitably cause the fire to spread to the interior, consuming furniture, decorations and any major structures inside (such as organs and similar). It also makes it very dangerous to send firefighters or security personell inside, either to fight the fire from below, or evacuate artworks or people. Shards from the large stained glass windows, which will collapse, crack, or even explode, from the heat only adds to the hazard.   As if this was not bad enough, the burning roof beams slots into the masonry and stonework in the upper parts of the walls. This means that in addition to the intense heat already generated by the burning roof, the fire will also enter the stone walls themselves. Although stone doesn't burn, it cracks and deforms when exposed to heat and flames, which in turn impacts their load-bearing ability. Thankfully, the Paris fire dept now says that they think the main structure, including the two western towers, has been saved. However, the extent of the damage to the walls, including whether parts of them have to be torn down and replaced altogether, will not be known for some time to come. Only a thorough inspection by experts will reveal whether the walls left standing will be able to take the weight of a new roof, or whether parts of them will have to be dismantled and rebuilt.  It is a tradegy of epic proportions. The only small rays of light appear to be that at least some of the artifacts normally housed inside were either rescued or had been removed at an earlier stage due to the ongoing renovations, and that the there is only one (at least reported thus far) injured person.   That said, my thoughts are with the cathedral staff, sapeurs pompiers and other members of the French security services still engaged in fighting the fire. They have a long night ahead of them. I wish them all the luck and strength in the world.  edit: [Thankfully](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7913bb38c3c38de61b85e37a8ae156e7be2cb07/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b52071f41e9a527233321795d8c80c64) [pictures](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2935187a27e3ef42e3d47227df7c6d68b4145390/0_318_4810_2888/master/4810.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a4bd82c016109bbefca34d306437956) [posted](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0389875255ef3a62d3230caa98b2a0beb2e7659/0_207_2112_2640/master/2112.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abdd2b49334d895472e3226b791bf166) by *the Guardian* newspaper appears to show that most of the inner vaulted ceiling has withstood the inferno above, and thus protected much of the interior.

Notre Dame des Paris isn’t just a cathedral or a landmark, it’s 800 years of Parisian history in one building. Even as an American in 21st Century Florida, I have a connection to her, as my 19th Century forebearers worked as carpenters during the restoration.   That does bring an actual question. The 19th Century restoration was mainly to fix the damage done during the Revolution: how did they know what things looked like or did they just make their best guess? How much of what’s been lost today is from before then?
72709	0	a	Norte Dame has been partially destroyed and restored in the past (I remember a huge effort in the 19th century which rebuilt the steeple, which was lost today). Norte Dame is also rather unique in that we have a lot of reference material (including an Assassin's Creed walk through!) describing how it looked pre-2019-fire, which should help with the restoration process. How has modern technology changed how buildings and art works are restored? What would we expect to see as the French government rebuilds the cathedral?
72710	0	a	A number of places were destroyed and rebuilt during WWII, my main example being Marienburg/Malbork castle.   How are these structures rebuilt?

72711	0	a	Could anyone discuss the notion that Victor Hugo's Notre Dame De Paris (what we've titled The Hunchback of Notre Dame in English) was really as much, if not more, about establishing the Cathedral itself as an important figure than it was about the characters in the story. Also, whether it sort of began and/or gave impetus to the concept of historical architecture/architectural preservation as a thing of importance and value?  I've seen some opinions to that effect, but I'm curious about the historians perspective.
72712	0	a	It's not exactly history in the academic sense, but as I was walking down towards Notre-Dame after leaving my lecture in Saint-Germain-des-Pres this evening, I couldn't help but think of Kenneth Clark. When he made Civilisation 50 years ago, he could have chosen to start anywhere--the Acropolis, the Coliseum. [He chose Notre-Dame de Paris.](https://youtu.be/w6qYjisp51M?t=132) What we lost today is hard to put into words, it's so much more than just a church or a cultural site. It's the physical embodiment of the highest heights of Western civilisation.  Being a part of the crowd outside was a truly moving experience. I was there for around an hour and forty-five minutes. A lot of people cried, the mood was quite sombre. But something happened that was even more powerful. At first it was only a small group of nuns, but slowly more and more people joined in singing hymns. At the end I have to imagine there may have been thousands of us all quietly singing together, with no prompting whatsoever. The only analogy I can come up with for the feeling there is that it must have been something like what it felt like to be in Manhattan on September 11.   I'm going to take advantage of the light moderation to talk about the wooden roof. I'm not an expert on medieval architecture, but what I heard being discussed today was that each of these wooden beams was hewn from one tree, and altogether it made up 12 acres of medieval forest. Does anyone know how accurate this story is?

72715	0	a	As a historian, I'm mindful that many of the buildings that modern people take as a sign of antiquity are 19th or early 20th Century reconstructions, that the reality of premodern architecture is that it usually burned down and was abandoned. Our romanticism about the built past is substantially a result of the way that 19th Century nationalism came to think about the value of older material culture.  But that is not much help when it comes to having actual feelings--this is only a vague reminder that there is a wider or more complicated context to keep in mind against my own profound sadness at seeing such an old and beautiful place be so badly damaged. Our sentiments may come from somewhere that is not eternal or natural, but we still feel them deeply.

72719	0	a	This is absolutely the case, or at least it's considered that way here in France. At the time of publication, the cathedral was in desperate need of repairs and many people were actually calling for tearing it down. Hugo could not countenance that and tried to write a book to show us just how important the cathedral was. And in that sense it was a resounding success.  I'm not sure if you read French, but here's a pretty significant line from the text:  « Sans doute, c’est encore aujourd’hui un majestueux et sublime édifice que l’église de Notre-Dame de Paris. Mais, si belle qu’elle se soit conservée en vieillissant, il est difficile de ne pas soupirer, de ne pas s’indigner devant les dégradations, les mutilations sans nombre que simultanément le temps et les hommes ont fait subir au vénérable monument »  « Mais dans tous les cas, quel que soit l’avenir de l’architecture, de quelque façon que nos jeunes d’architectes résolvent un jour la question de leur art, en attendant les monuments nouveaux, **conservons les monuments anciens. Inspirons, s’il est possible, à la nation l’amour de l’architecture nationale.** » (emphasis my own)
72720	0	a	The main reason was funding. Remember, Hagia Sophia was built by *the Roman Empire*, with the power of the Roman economy behind it. Justinian I had the purse and authority to hire far more craftsmen and skilled laborers than any medieval ruler, even the pope. Not to mention the empire had a population of \~30 million at the time, so the sheer number of available artisans was also higher. There was a massive surplus from Anastasius' and Justin I's effective administrative ability, and so dumping that into public works was relatively easy, and there were no concerns about delays due to lack of funding, which plagued medieval cathedrals.

The rest of the roof fell onto the vault, which has held. Most of the windows seem intact, and considering the organ is between the towers, which are relatively unscathed, it *may* just have smoke damage.   I've heard unconfirmed reports that the rose windows –which contain medieval glass – may have collapsed/melted, however.
72723	0	a	"Well, yes, but that would have been the case had the roof remained in place as well. The reason you build flying buttresses is to support the walls, which otherwise would be unable to carry the weight of the roof.   The buttresses no doubt help keep the walls, damaged or not, upright. Yet to see the walls of stone buildings remain upright after a major fire, even where buttresses were not part of the original structure, is not uncommon. A fire in a heavy roof will tend to make the roof cave in on itself, in many instanses collapsing into the building interior. The potential heat damage to the wall masonry is unrelated to the collapse itself, and since it is the uppermost reaches of the walls which are most likely to have suffered heat damage, the disapperance of the weight of the roof means that their load bearing abilities are no longer tested. Thus they remain standing.  As of yet, this is nevertheless pure guesswork. We won't kow anything until thorough inspections can be performed, and I'm guessing that will be some time. If we're lucky, the damage is only ""minor"", if such a word can be used in a situation like this."

72730	0	a	I find this sentiment slightly disconcerting. Much of the wall structure appears to have been saved, but I don't believe the historical value of the serious damage suffered by the cathedral can be parsed. The collapsed spire, a 19th century creation, was as much a part of the cathedral whole - and as worthy of study and admiration - as the wall sections dating back to the 12th century.   Even if the destruction wrought in the interior of the church, of which we yet know almost nothing, should prove to be minor (and I so hope it is), the damage caused to the upper reaches of the cathedral is massive. A building like this is in a sense like living being. It goes through alterations and refurbishments, suffers wear and tear, undergoes restorations and rebuilds, but any loss - especially on this scale - hurts.

In this case it's constructed of ribs of stone, infilled with more stone. Above that was a wooden roof. The roof that's been burning was the wooden roof. When it collapsed it fell on to the top of the stone vault, which has remained mostly intact and prevented the burning timbers from falling into the interior.

72737	0	a	Thank you to lcnielsen, great comment! While reading it, I had a follow-up question occur to me, both that comment and the OP in general.  While legacy is certainly a massive part in the bias, is it also possible that the settled-nomad dichotomy is at play as well?   As far as I can remember my uni classes, most settled peoples had a very lowly view on nomadic peoples, and for some living closer to these groups, outright feared them (e.g. China). Chinggis' rule seems to be far more lenient than most conquerors' (that is, if your city surrendered), yet it is rarely remembered for its tolerance for religion or opening of safe trade routes. Are there any reasons to to believe this attribute plays into this as well?
72738	0	a	Can I ask a follow-on? I believe that Genghis Khan (and possibly Attila?) followed the practice of treating cities well if they surrendered before battle, but putting them, any civilians to the sword if they resisted. This lead to mass casualties amongst civiloans I believe.  Did Alexander do a similar thing in his conquests? Did his sacking of cities etc have comparable brutality? I guess in a nutshell - are we comparing apples and apples in terms of method and brutality?

I think it's a more general thing - who is telling the story, for what audience, and for what purpose? Of course, if you are composing an ""othering"" narrative, then obvious differences like settled vs. nomadic lifestyle makes it much easier to highlight contrasts."

The destruction of Persepolis is the best known, but it's misleading since Persepolis was more like an enormous imperial estate or palace complex than a proper city.  This wasn't an uncommon thing in ancient times mind you. For instance, Cyrus is said to have destroyed the city of Opis and ""slaughtered the people"" after defeating the main Babylonian army, though the language used is a bit ambiguous in the original Babylonian. Xerxes sacked Athens, etc."

Yes, but I prefer to use a more general framing unless specific sources are discussed.  >Especially given that apparently the Khanate was quite respected in Europe per contemporary primary sources until anti-Asian bias came with the Enlightenment according to another comment.  Yes, it's always more complicated than one might think. You have a similar thing with a negative view of Persia owing a fair bit to the translation of the Greek classics into Latin coinciding with Ottoman encroaching on European soil in the 15th century.  EDIT: I got a comment about Persepolis actually being a city, but it was deleted, so I will just post what I wrote in response here, slightly edited for clarity:  Persepolis kind of was ""in the middle of nowhere"", which is why there's still not universal agreement on what its real function was (celebration of New Year is one suggestion you see from time to time). The site is something like 300 x 500 meters, the size of a dozen football fields if you will.  Estakhr, some kilometers away, is usually thought to have been a small-ish settlement in the Achaemenid era. Berossus says that Artaxerxes II erected a statue of Anahita in the vicinity of it; according to Boyce that might refer to the temple a few kilometers away. In any case, it's in the Seleucid erathat it becomes a major settlement."

Large and well-organized protests in this time period would employ or acquire via professional volunteers signage like the ones you use as examples. (A modern equivalent might be having a WordPress website set up for your protest: It's a common professional skill and not as expensive or difficult to acquire as you might think.)   (If your question is more of a technical one: These signs weren't all individually hand-lettered. A professional lettering artist makes one copy, then the artwork is photographed and turned into a plate for silkscreening or lithography.)  Signage was seen as part of branding a cause, and this professional approach intersected well with the Madison-Avenue advertising culture of the day. In addition to hand-lettered signage like your examples, there are famous examples of professionally printed protest signs such as the ""[I Am a Man](https://imgur.com/a/rWdF0)"" signs (from a Memphis custodian protest) and [Malcolm X rallies](https://imgur.com/mpKcR7p) around various causes. Don't underestimate the resources available to well-organized events.  Starting in the 60s-70s and the counter-culture movement in America, signage even at larger events become much more home-grown and improvised. You'll see a lot more free expression in anti-Vietnam [protest signs in the 70s](https://imgur.com/a/iNzdi), for example — and again, this reflects a shift in the culture of expression of the times.  Of course, there has always been a range of home-grown signage alongside professionally-produced signage, these patterns are only generalizations. You can certainly see [home-grown signage from mid-century](https://imgur.com/a/ajwdk) and [professionally produced signs today](https://imgur.com/a/cpbiU).  Lastly, your question might actually just be one of aesthetics: There's little technical difference between how the signs in your example were produced and how BLM or Westboro Baptist Church signs are made. You may just personally think the lettering is nicer looking when it was done by hand, before computers. And I'd agree with you.    Also: Protest art is a whole field of graphic design history and collection. For more, check out [The Art of Protest](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780816637713) by T.V. Reed. Artists and designers have always been part of political movements, it's an interesting lens through which to learn some social history.  "

If you've come to the thread and are wondering why there's no answer yet, please be patient: we have found that it takes an average of 9 hours for a good answer to appear on a popular thread - properly researching and writing an answer takes time. If you want to be reminded of this thread in a few days, [please see here for information on how to send a private message to RemindMeBot](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/) to remind you about this thread.  If you're wondering what's in the removed comments, typically it's either one sentence answers based on quick googling (if that), people shitposting or wondering what happened to the removed comments. In this particular thread there are also few removed comments very briefly explaining that the third picture is from an animator's guild strike.   All of these comments get removed on /r/AskHistorians because our readers want accurate, comprehensive, in-depth historical answers based on good historical practice and high-quality sources. While it's interesting that the third picture is from an animator's guild strike, we want an *in-depth* and *comprehensive* historical answer which also explains the first two pictures.   It's amazing how many downvotes and reports an obvious shitpost can attract on a popular thread on /r/AskHistorians within minutes, thanks to our readers - if you see it, report it! On /r/AskHistorians, we want people answering questions to be able to explain not just what the basic facts are, [but why we know that these basic facts are right, and to put those basic facts into context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). This is why we encourage [the use of primary and secondary sources in answering questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_sources), rather than tertiary sources like Wikipedia, podcasts and textbooks.  In other words, on /r/AskHistorians, we'd rather have no answer than bad attempts at answers. By removing short, quick, bad answers, the well-researched in-depth answers (that take people time to research and write) are more likely to be seen. The downside to this is that we have to remove a lot of shitposts and comments wondering what happened to the removed comments.

On one hand, the collection is perhaps not quite as interesting as we might want: the Venn diagram of ""people who were both literate and whose writings are likely to have survived"" and ""people with an awareness of a basic history of the Roman Empire and its decline"" is basically the first circle inside the second, especially from the mid-11th century on. On the other hand, their shared knowledge of and appreciation for ancient Rome offers a good basis for comparison of different perspectives.  Benjamin of Tudela is a good place to start for an important reason: in the face of Rome's role at the heart of medieval Christianity, Benjamin was Jewish! He came from Navarre in Iberia, and his meandering travel account catalogues the Jewish communities he traveled among around the Mediterranean. You can read his full account of Rome and Roman Jews [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14981/14981-h/14981-h.htm#bpage_5) (Cntl/Cmd+F for ""Rome"" is easiest if the link target doesn't work), but to excerpt a few bits:  > There are many wonderful structures in the city, different from any others in the world. **Including both its inhabited and ruined parts,** Rome is about twenty-four miles in circumference. In the midst thereof there are eighty palaces belonging to eighty kings who lived there, each called Imperator, commencing from King Tarquinius down to Nero and Tiberius, who lived at the time of Jesus the Nazarene, ending with Pepin, who freed the land of Sepharad from Islam, and was father of Charlemagne.  > There is a palace outside Rome (said to be of Titus). The Consul and his 300 Senators treated him with disfavour, because he failed to take Jerusalem till after three years, though they had bidden him to capture it within two.  > In Rome is also the palace of Vespasianus, a great and very strong building; also the Colosseum...There were battles fought here in olden times, and in the palace more than 100,000 men were slain, and there their bones remain piled up to the present day. The king caused to be engraved a representation of the battle and of the forces on either side facing one another, both warriors and horses, all in marble, to exhibit to the world the war of the days of old.  > In Rome there is a cave which runs underground, and catacombs...In the church of St. John in the Lateran there are two bronze columns taken from the Temple, the handiwork of King Solomon, each column being engraved ""Solomon the son of David."" The Jews of Rome told me that every year upon the 9th of Ab they found the columns exuding moisture like water.  Although Benjamin observes that some of Rome is standing/inhabited and some is ruins, he does not distinguish which is which in his description (nor does that distinction allow for, as we will see, inhabited ruins). However, he is keenly aware of the history of the ancient Roman buildings and those who lived in them. Those stories--what Rome *was*--matter more than what they *are*. He takes note of great buildings, natural features, and smaller monuments. I also think the detail about the columns of the Temple seized and appropriated into a Christian church are fascinating and significant. Especially in recounting the miracle story of the local Jewish community, Benjamin shows that Rome could have a sacred geography for *non*-Christians--something I, at least, am not used to thinking of.  Notably absent from Benjamin's record, on the other hand, is commentary on the *fall* of Rome. For this, believe it or not, we have to turn to Christian writers. In their stylings, a very real admiration for classical antiquity aligns with the medieval Christian theology of history that saw a ""world grown old,"" decaying towards apocalypse and only ever renewable by God. 11th-12th century cleric Hildebert of Lavardin, eventually archbishop of Tours, wrote two famous poems *de Roma* which both celebrate and mourn the ancient city as he found it at the very end of the 11th century. Here's an excerpt from one:  > The city now is fallen; I can find  > No worthier epitaph than “this was Rome.”  > Yet neither the flight of years, nor flame nor sword  > Could fully wipe away its loveliness  > […] Bring wealth, new marble, and the help of gods  > Let craftsmen’s hands be active in their work—  > Yet shall these standing walls no equal find,  > Nor can these ruins even be restored  > The care of men once built so great a Rome  > The care of gods could not dissolve its stones  > Divinities admire their faces carved,  > And wish themselves the equal of these forms  > Nature could not make gods as fair of face  > As man created images of gods  With Hildebert, praises of Rome move into a more emotional register, but also a more intellectual one rather than practical/geographical. His words are grounded in ancient Rome's buildings and especially its art but he evokes the splendor of a lost civilization rather than the immediate materiality of buildings rooted in history. It's also significant that Hildebert's praise, while overtly of the artistic qualities of ancient Roman art, is actually directed at the *human artists*. He elevates the abilities of humans of old especially compared to present ones, whose skills and vision could never possibly measure up.  A few years later, the English traveler known as Master Gregory famously followed Hildebert's footsteps to Rome. Gregory actually knew one of Hildebert's poems--he quotes it in his own little travel guide-like account!--but takes his commentary a step further.  > The sight of the whole city is, I think, most wonderful, where there is such a multitude of towers, so great a number of palaces, as none can count. When I first saw the city from far off, I was overwhelmed and remembered Caesar's view of it, when having conquered the Gauls and crossed the Alps, he exclaimed *substantial quote from Caesar*...  > This beauty passing understanding I long admired, and I thanked God who...yet has magnified there the works of man with immeasurable beauty. For even if Rome falls into complete ruin, nothing that is intact can be compared with it. As has been said [by Hildebert, in fact]:  > *Nothing can equal Rome, Rome even in ruins*  > *Your ruins speak aloud your former greatness*  > **The ruin of Rome shows clearly, I think, that all temporal things are near their end, especially when the worldly center of all things, Rome, daily languishes and decays.**  Rome as the ""worldly"" center of the word is one of those little noteworthy turns of phrase. In medieval Christian *sacred* geography, the center of the world was Jerusalem. Here, though, Gregory focuses on the human component in Christian world/salvation history--and he is even more explicit than Hildebert about the decline of the present from earlier greatness.  We're used to a ""decline and fall of Rome"" narrative as Christians supposedly ruining the great rationality/progress/technology of pagan/philosophical Rome. Medieval Christians actually took part in the view of a Roman golden age compared to their own; for them, however, the rise of Christianity was less a *cause* of decline than an inevitable step towards ultimate divine redemption.  Gregory relates one more detail I want to highlight here: he tells us that many of the statues from the days of pagan Roman glory were dismantled by (very important) Pope Gregory I! We can agree on one hand it's quite noteable that he's repeating a story about Christians actively opposing the preservation of pagan art, and not very approvingly. On the other, this Gregory projects the 'desecration' onto another Gregory several centuries in the past.  In fact, the appropriation and remixing of ancient Rome into a Christian city was *ongoing* throughout the Middle Ages. Even in the later 15th century, with ""Renaissance"" adulation of classical antiquity building to a fever pitch, prelates in Rome were still plunder the Colosseum and deserted palaces for stones for their own lavish building projects!  This brings us to the last thing I want to talk about: archaeological evidence for ""what people thought"" of Roman ruins, evidence that perhaps helps us get beyond the view of the absolute elite of the elite of high medieval society. The Colosseum is the famous example here, since it enjoyed many afterlives throughout the Middle Ages. Most famously, it eventually became a little neighborhood for artisans! Quarrymen and blacksmiths set up residence, even building the occasional shop for horseshoes and other goods. Eventually, a monastery was constructed in and around part of it. And all the while, tantalizing blocks of stone were usurped for building projects elsewhere.  Visitors to Rome saw ""ruins"" and ""desertion,"" and the ashes of of past splendor. People who lived in Rome may well have seen that, too. But they also saw promise for the present and the future: what could be out of what had been."

72747	0	a	"Benjamin of Tudela wrote in Hebrew, and I could not for the life of me tell you definitely what the original measurement used is (Roman *mil*?) or whether the ""mile"" mentioned here is converted to today's Imperial standard. The translator's notes very helpfully define for us what Benjamin means by ""parasang"" and ""day's journey,"" but not what is translated ""mile""!  Benjamin writes that Kus is ""300 miles"" to Fayoum, and according to the editor Kus is halfway between Qena and Luxor. That gives a distance of ~330 modern miles according to Google maps, which seems close enough to the modern unit for someone measuring distance by guesstimate (since he writes elsewhere about being able to see ""100 miles"" from a vantage spot, and so forth).  As for kilometers--this translation was published in England in 1907, so--nope, definitely not going to be converting to km for publication."
72748	0	a	"Well, medieval travel writers knew that the Chinese used toilet paper.  But I'm getting ahead of myself here.  > There was, in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a powerful King among the Kings of China...He was wealthy as he was powerful, but he had grown old without being blessed with a son...At last, he sought the intercession of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) with the Most High and implored Him, by the glory of His Prophets and Saints and Martyrs...that he would grant him a son.  > *[it works]*  > He committed his boy to...the harim till he reached the age of seven. Then he ...gathered together the Olema (*ulema*) and philosophers and doctors of law and religion, from all countries.   > *-from ""The Craft and Malice of Women,"" Burton trans.*  ""'Alā' ad-Dīn and the Wonderful Lamp"" is kind of an awkward text to work with. The manuscript tradition (...traditions) of the *1001 Nights* is a mess already--our earliest notions of the text are only 1000 nights, for starters, and no surviving copy gets close to having 1001 tales. But probably the most famous of the tales even before Disney has special problems, namely, it isn't actually part of that medieval manuscript tradition at all. The way medieval texts including/especially *1001 Nights* worked, that absolutely doesn't mean it's not just as deeply rooted as others. But when a story first shows up in the 17th/18th century as Europeans are getting their hands on the text, there's room for caution.  Fortunately, tales like the frame story ""The Craft and Malice of Women,"" which has an alternate title but why would you ever use it, serve as a fine substitute. The frame and some of its internal tales trace back through the Egyptian manuscript tradition, so we're good here.  I dumped a block quote on you at the beginning so you could situate yourself: we've got a ""King of the Kings"" of China (a title that medieval Arabic geographers use when talking about a land they're a bit more familiar with, Persia), an *ulema* or class of Muslim scholars, astrologers, philosophers, religious leaders, and--oh yeah--Islam. In other words, we're dealing with the trappings of medieval Islamic culture in this text, too.  But, well...this doesn't exactly coincide with what merchant, diplomats, and ethnographers are writing about China just about the same time people start writing down *1001 Nights* collections (or at least, ones that survive). For starters:  >  I do not know of a single member of [China or India] who is a Muslim, and Arabic is not spoken.  Our ninth-century informant adopted by 10th century author Abū Zayd al-Ḥasan al-Sīrāfī has more to say comparing the two lands:  > India is the land of medicine and of philosophers; the Chinese also have medical knowledge. Most of their medicine involves cauterization. In addition, they have a knowledge of astronomy and astrology, although this is more widespread in India.  Just from the *beginning* of the tale, then, it's clear that *The Craft and Malice of Women* is set in a fantastical China, not the actual one. The examples continue, like houses being made of stucco instead of wood. We'll return to the fantasy in a bit, because as promised: toilet paper.  Abū Zayd and whatever earlier accounts he's drawing on for the first book of his text (he probably doesn't know for sure and it may well have multiple sources; a later author attributes excerpts from it to a merchant called Sulayman) offer a surprisingly rich view of early medieval China. In the beginning of book two, in fact, Abū Zayd recounts a long history of a recent rebellion! But it's especially fascinating to see what details of Chinese culture the geographer-ethnographers and their sources emphasize.  > The Chinese are unhygienic, and they do not wash their backsides with water after defecating but merely wipe themselves with paper.   Yeah, like that one.  Throughout the text, comparisons to Arab culture or other known cultures help the original readers understand China and help us understand why Abū Zayd et al. emphasize particular details.  > Their staple food is rice. They often cook a sauce to go with it, which they pour on the rice before eating it. Their ruling classes, however, eat wheat bread and the ﬂesh of all sorts of animals, including pigs and other such creatures.   Eating all meats is a big deal to the Muslim observer. Elsewhere, he compares Chinese religious practices to Zoroastrians. This is a good remind not to take everything at face value, though. Anna Akasoy has shown that ""Zoroastrianism"" (a twisted idea thereof) was a common framework through which Muslim ethnographers sought to understand foreign religions in, for example, West Africa.  Given the consternation we see on AskHistorians about medieval Muslims and alcohol, this is a particularly interesting observation:  > Their drink is a wine made from rice. Grape wine is not to be found in their land, and it is never imported—indeed, they do not know of it and do not drink it.   It looks like our author is quite familiar with wine made from grapes!  We also learn that the Chinese tax foreign imports at a 30% rate, have a fiscal bureaucracy staffed by eunuchs, and place an enormous premium on reading and writing. I'll include another passage that's a popular interest topic on AskHistorians: a sort of premodern passport:  > Anyone wanting to travel from one part of China to another obtains two documents. The document from the ruler is a permit for the road, made out in the name of the traveler and those accompanying him, and stating his age and his companions’ ages, and the tribe from which he comes...The second document concerns the traveler’s money and any goods he may have.   > The reason for this procedure is that there are guardposts on the road where they examine both documents, and, when a traveler arrives at one, they write, ""So-and-so, son of So-and-so, of Such-and-such an origin, arrived at our guardpost on the nth day of the nth month of the nth year, accompanied by So-and-so."" This is in order that none of the traveler’s money or goods should go missing.  I don't have to tell you not to take all this as surah truth about early medieval China. In most cases we're dealing with multiple layers of transmission, and a culture where repeating earlier stories was as good as firsthand observation/often treated as firsthand observation. Nevertheless, modern scholars generally consider the fact-checkable points somewhat reliable--at least, much more so than contemporary accounts like *The Wonders of India*, a fascinating collection of sailors' stories in which basically everyone gets shipwrecked on a island of Amazons or cannibals.  I've already mentioned the difficult heritage of this text. It survives in one damanged manuscript copy today. But we know that whoever wrote it in the 9th century, it was read and copied in the 10th by Abū Zayd and by the Persian scholar Ibn al-Faqīh. In other words, in the Middle Ages, this text got around a little!  But then we have to balance the scholars versus the storytellers. When we talk about ""medieval Muslims' knowledge of China,"" we shouldn't just think about the best-connected. While obviously also not everyone was reading *1001 Nights* itself, the ubiquity of many of its stories around the Mediterranean world suggests a much more common currency for them than for Abū Zayd.  And don't let the insertion of Islam, science, kings, and harems--perfectly ordinary elements of life to medieval Muslims!--fool you. The China of the *1001 Nights* is a China ""days of yore and in ages and times long gone before""--it's stocked full of the magic that, even if not the *specific* story of Ala ad-Din, the same air of exoticism and, dare I say it, Orientalism."

72750	0	a	"""Homeward Bound"" by William Holberton is a great resource about this topic specifically. It deals exclusively with the demobilization of both Confederate and Union armies. I'll quote from it heavily in my response. I'm currently sitting on a plane in Seattle, typing this on my iPhone before I fly home to my family in Alaska, so please excuse any errors I make.   I used to be flared in this sub-Reddit for the U.S. Civil War, so hopefully that buys me some ""thread credibility.""   The disbanding of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia was all in all a peaceful process, considering how long the men fought for and how far away from home many of them were. While there were serious concerns about an insurrection after the surrender, R.E. Lee cut a strong figure to his men (as well as Lincoln's firm tone of reconciliation) that upon receiving his order to peacefully disband, Lee did just that.   I know it might sound strange, but after the men were paroled by Grant and the Union Army they simply melted away into the forest and surrounding roads, towns and hamlets in small groups or on their own, making their way up to 1,500-2,000 miles home. Those who had to trek through the south were particularly hampered because of the thorough job General William Tecumseh Sherman had done in destroying the railroads in his legendary campaign.   There were cases of small scale looting, but nothing so bad as the potential guerrilla warfare that many citizens feared might transpire after the official surrender of the Confederacy.   One observer noted of the paroled men, ""As a rule they were tall, thin, spare men with long hair and a beard of a tawney red color. They were all clad in the uniform of Southern grey; nearly all were ragged and dirty...""  According to the terms of surrender, ""each body of soldiers was allowed to hold rifles equal to one-seventh of their numerical strength for protection and hunting along the way home."" There was talk of confiscating horses or mules from those who owned them, but once the idea of how to tend a farm in post-war life was brought up these men who were fortunate enough to own a beast of burden were allowed to keep them.   An Englishman Francis Lowley observed the surrender at Appomattox and wrote, ""By the evening of the 12th paroles...were distributed, and the disbanded men began to scatter through the country. Hardly one of them had a farthing of money. Some of them had 1,500 to 2,000 miles to travel over a country of which the scanty railroads were utterly annihilated.""  What's important to remember about these men is that this was the dedicated core of what was left of Lee's once mighty Army. At this point, desertions had ticked up after Grant pushed Lee out of Richmond, and had his Union soldiers nipping at Lee's flanks and heels, like a pack of bloodhounds, as they fought predominantly rear guard engagements until reaching Appomattox.   Point being is that this was one tough contingent of men who were used to fighting for their lives with scant, if any, supply lines. Now that these men were paroled and didn't have the pressure of fighting for their lives each day, it is easier to understand how these men were able to make their way back to their respective homes without having much else besides the clothes on their backs.   The experiences for travelers differed greatly, depending on rank and distance to home.   General Lee was given an armed escort for his journey, which wasn't very far since he travelled in Virginia. He was met cordially along the road by his former soldiers, many of them hooting and hollering the rebel yell one last time for their proud commander. It was reported one morning that Lee had an eventful breakfast of ""hard tack, fried pork and black coffee,"" the latter of which being quite rare during the war, as the Union blockade forced many confederate soldiers to find substitutes to traditional coffee, generals and privates alike.   Yet the travels of some of the rank and file soldiers were much longer indeed. A sergeant from Texas, Valerius C. Giles, had been away for four years and five months. Slowly and ""painfully"" it took him three months to travel back to his home.   But to me this quote sums it up best: ""A sad procession; some were halt and lame, and some with one arm or one eye. Yet these men, careworn and anxious-looking, and wounded as they may have been were on their way home, and nothing was going to prevent them, however long and circuitous, to that goal.""   These men were alive. They'd seen their comrades die and their cause vanish. Yet they were still standing. The human spirit, not only in this conflict but in all conflicts around the world, is strong and those who are still breathing will find their way home after the last bullet has flown. And that's exactly what Lee's men did, no matter how long the journey.   Ahh...it feels so good to be posting in this sub-Reddit again. "
72751	0	a	"This is my first lengthy comment on /r/AskHistorians, so I hope it fulfills the general criteria.  I wanted to address a specific point of your question which was ""were most of Lee's men from Virginia?"" Though Lee was the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, it turns out that not many brigades of Virginians were actually involved in the Confederate order of battle. Looking at a list of the Appomattox Campaign, you'd find that approximately 8 brigades of infantry were ""Virginia"" regiments. Usually an average full-strength infantry brigade could have about 2,500 troops, leading to simple math that suggests there might have been as many as 20,000 VA infantry.   But, the math here intuitively seems wrong -- as you might realize, most regiments (constituent parts of the brigade) were already below 50% strength by this late stage of the war. For example, the 34th VA Infantry Regiment mustered out with 466 troops and only surrendered 224 at Appomattox. Indeed, looking at the rest of the order of battle points to *32* different brigades of soldiers not from Virginia, spreading across the Confederacy from Maryland to Louisiana. The amount of Virginia infantry is a significant, but not all-encompassing, amount.  Interestingly, there were 6 brigades of cavalry from Virginia, yielding a much higher percentage of the Army of Northern Virginia's total cavalry force. By comparison, there were only 2 brigades from North Carolina (under Generals Barringer and Roberts) and a handful of other Southern troopers mixed into Gary's brigade from GA, SC, and VA.  It is worth noting that the order of battle also has a ""Richmond Department"" led by Ewell that was entirely made of men from VA.  Though this may not answer every element of your question, it begins to suggest that the overwhelming majority of troops were not, in fact, particularly close to their homes when Lee surrendered.

Additionally, I have removed this and handed over approval to another mod).  To start off, I'd give a nod to /u/FoucaultMeMichel's comment to a follow-up question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9l4uus/italians_were_considered_nonwhites_until_1945_did/e74oz9d/) which addresses part of the premise, namely the idea of Italians and ""Whiteness"", which wasn't quite a dichotomy that flipped in 1945, but rather a process that slowly took place from the late 19th through the mid-20th century. So by the 1920s, at the height of the Second KKK, ""whiteness"" and what it meant was a factor in how members of the Italian-American community were viewed by the Klan, but it was only one of several.   The first Klan, of the immediate post-Civil War period, can be (if in a rush) understood in very stark racial terms, but the second had broader concerns, advocating an idea that native-born, white Protestants were the only proper American. They were anti-Immigrant and anti-Catholic, both of which were strong marks against the those of Italian extraction. The Klan demanded an American community that was, to borrow from Pegram, ""normative"". In this vision of America there was no room for hyphenated identities. You couldn't be an Italian-American, nor a Catholic-American. To be sure, racial ideas of the superiority of Anglo-Saxon heritage also played an important part here. *Legally* speaking White included Europeans of Slavic or Mediterranean extraction, who were admitted to the country as white persons by laws that banned or limited non-whites, but that doesn't mean that they were accepted as equals by those of a nativity mindset, well exemplified by the Klan. Racial stereotypes about various groups' dictated views, as did circumstance too, as poor, recent immigrants often had to do menial, backbreaking labor that for many was the job only of their racial inferiors, which also helped to feed ideas of them being 'non-white'.  So the point here is that you have several overlapping factors, all of which helped feed this idea of 'otherness' for ethnic Italians, which in the end can really come down to their desire to maintain some sense of their ethnic identity while *still* trying to also see themselves as American at the same time, an idea which the Klan abhorred and believed contradictory. Targeted communities responded in different ways, some pushing back while others feeling pressure to be more vocal in their Americanism. Anti-Catholic rhetoric often (but not always) pushed previously separate ethnic communities that were nevertheless united by religious ties to bond over their Catholicism and fight back together. This could at times take the form of violence, such as in Marienette, WI where French, German, Irish, and Polish Catholics - all who attended different parishes - joined together to shut down a Klan meeting after it was learned that a KKK speaker had insulted a priest. Klan rhetoric also could help unite simply on ethnic persecutions too, at times seeing alliances between African-Americans, Jews, and the various Catholic communities. In the end, while it doesn't make it right by any means, it can be said that Klan rhetoric helped, at least in part, to actually develop a better sense of pluralist Americanism, by forcing the various disunited groups they had targeted to seek out each other and work together to craft a more vocal and open idea of being both themselves and American.  *But*, this is all general 'fighting back' and you are interested in something a little more specific obviously. The short answer is that having scanned through every book I have on the Klan (See sources below), I was unable to find anything that suggested a serious effort by the Mafia to combat the KKK either physically or via rhetoric, although ironically, a belief that all Italians were in the mafia (i.e. criminal lowlifes) helped fuel ethnic hatreds within the KKK. I can't say this was unexpected, but I am sorry to report it. However, I can at least offer you the runner up prize and touch specifically physical resistance to the Klan within the Italian-American and larger Catholic-American community, both by individuals, and also fraternal groups such as the Knights of Columbus, and the smaller Knights of the Flaming Circle, so that is kind of the next best thing, right?  There were all manner of ways that these groups sought to disrupt and fight back against the Klan. Many young men would engage in all sorts of heckling and sabotage, such as scattering tacks on the road the night before a Klan rally so as to puncture the car tires, all the way up through nighttime bombings of Klan-affiliated printing presses. When the KKK showed up at South Bend, Indiana in 1924 to demonstrate on the grounds of (Catholic) University of Notre Dame, an all-out melee broke out when, rather then sit by passively - an organizer had remarked in advance that ""*if some of those priests come out it will be up to us to hit him [sic] in the nose.*” - students swarmed the marchers and send them scurrying.   One particularly notable example of this resistance was the Knights of the Flaming Circle, a group formed to be an anti-Klan organization, with their own secret rituals and symbolism, and created by young men who believed that the Knights of Columbus was too stuffy and not willing to endorse *real* (ie violent) solutions. A Catholic organization drawing from the Italian and Irish community, it formed in 1923 as a reaction to a riot in Steubenville, Ohio. Originating in the Mahoning Valley of the state, it was founded by dentist and ""Grand Supreme Monarch"" W.S. McGuigan. The Flaming Circle was a tongue-in-cheek mimicry of the Klan, taking their name from the act of burning a tire in public which they did to mock the Klan's cross-burning, but also a deadly serious group, willing and seeking to pick fights and do their best to ensure the KKK regretted showing up. They sought both to protect their neighborhoods from Klan interference, as well as to disrupt Klan activities, and generally signal they wouldn't be cowed. When a cross was burned in front of a church, they would respond by burning tires in front of the houses of those suspected to have Klan ties. Many Klan rallies in the mid-20s would be met by mobs from these and similar groups, often armed and ready for a fight.  And more importantly, *it worked*. It became harder for the Klan to portray itself as an innocuous, civic-minded organization when their rallies kept turning into violent affrays, and in turn the result was the loss of many members who were less than wholly committed, or otherwise unwilling to put actually deal with such incidents. The Klan may have trumpeted a militant rhetoric, but not all walked-the-walk, and when faced with opponents willing to take them at their word, many couldn't stand to. Splits within the organization even came about from this, with comparative moderates who tempered their rhetoric in reaction to such push-back going one way, while the true militants going the other, often to be met with the same results, such as planned marchers in Niles, Ohio, where one of the most violent reactions to the Klan occurred.    The march there had been billed as a major one, timed to the November elections and intended to be a demonstration against Catholic influence in the schools. The mayor and police chief were seen as Klan lackeys, and in the opening salvo from the Knights of the Flaming Circle, their houses were bombed. Roadblocks were erected to prevent Klansmen from entering the town, resulting in exchanges of gunfire. The mayor deputized several Klansmen which did little to stop the violence, and the National Guard had to be called in. In the end, the march never actually happened, and was an abject disaster for the Klan who had hoped to portray themselves as for law and order. Many Klansmen simply quit, and in Niles, at least, it was mostly done in. Other chapters of the Flaming Circle, which was mostly focused in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, similarly used armed demonstrations against the Klan, but never with quite the same level of violence.  So in sum, yes, Italian-Americans were a target of the KKK, on several different grounds, including their general status as an immigrant community, their ethnic origins, and their religion. They were hardly alone in this though, and often found compatriots in other immigrant, ethnic, and/or non-Protestant communities that were similarly targeted by the KKK, and fought back both together and separately. While your pondering over involvement of the Mafia makes for what would maybe make for a great old-school B-film, there seems to be no evidence of Mafia involvement institutionally, even if individuals with Mafia ties may have participated. There were however fraternal groups that *did* fight back. The Knights of Columbus were a public advocate against the Klan, while smaller, more shadowy groups like the Irish-Italian Knights of the Flaming Circle attempted to beat the Klan at their own ""secret society"" game. In some ways these groups were similar to the Mafia, even, which was a 'protection organization' after all, although rather then acting by extorting the community they claimed to protect, the Flaming Circle and its ilk were driven by a real desire to defend their community, and live the American Dream."

72761	0	a	"So, the ""500 years of Swiss neutrality"" has been disputed as a historical myth invented in the 19th century, a sort of ""invented tradition"".  In his 1983 essay volume edited together with Terence Ranger, Eric Hobsbawm describes that a lot of traditions we today associate with being old, handed down for generations etc. are invented, mostly in the service of nationalism in the 19th century and only claim to be much older than that. As they remark, ""modern nations and all their impedimenta generally claim to be the opposite of novel, namely rooted in remotest antiquity, and the opposite of constructed, namely human communities so 'natural' as to require no definition other than self-assertion."" and that also applies to many a symbol or practice associated with that new nation and national sentiment. From supposedly ancient Scottish clan tartans that were introduced in the 19th century to the martial arts of Japan, the nationalist movement lies at the base for a lot of these supposedly ancient traditions and symbols.  This also applies to the idea of Swiss neutrality since the 16th century since that narrative was created in the 19th century under specific historical circumstances to which I'll get in a minute.  To start off with the traditional narrative: It is generally held that the old Swiss Confederacy (Eidgenossenschaft) adopted neutrality after the battle of Marignano in Lombardy when Swiss mercenaries fought against France in the battle for rule over Northern Italy and suffered a terrible defeat where the Swiss mercenaries suffered between 8000 and 10000 casualties. The exact politics behind the battle are complicated and not exactly my expertise but what is important is that the troops of the Swiss confederacy fought against the French who desired control over Northern Italy. The battle had far reaching consequences: It ended all expansionist politics of the old Swiss Confederacy, showed that mercenaries were not the best way to fight wars anymore and forced the Confederacy to sign a peace treaty with France that put the Swiss Confederacy under the cultural and political influence of France. Within the Confederacy it ended a period of communal foreign policy that had been difficult to maintain even beforehand, mainly because of the religious split of the various cantons.  When Marignano is cited today the prevailing narrative behind it is that the defeat was so terrible that from it grew the policy of Swiss Neutrality that was maintained basically until up to today. But that narrative has actually little basis. The way it came about shows the intentions behind it:  Modern Swiss Neutrality has its origins in the Vienna Congress of 1815 when the European powers after having defeated Napoleon agreed that it was sensible to have a neutral Switzerland in their midst. France and Austria originally planned for Switzerland to become a satellite state while Prussia wanted to integrate it in the German Bund. Because there were so many plans and so many competing interests, these powers ultimately agreed for Switzerland to remain neutral and thus the modern legal concept of state neutrality was born.  As most of the people familiar with Switzerland know, it is a rather hands off state and was especially so during the 19th century. In the latter half of that century, it also became a safe haven for people forced to flee other European countries because of their political views (probably the most famous example being Lenin). Now when Bismarck in Germany passed his famous ""Socialist Laws"". which outlawed socialist, communist and social democratic political activity, many German socialists and communists fled to Switzerland in order to escape persecution.  Because Switzerland did not invest too much in police observing these socialists as well as other left-wingers from Russia and France, various European powers started to send spies in order to keep tabs on the various left-wing politicians and activists. One of these spies, a German named August Wohlgemuth was arrested in the Canton Aargau in 1889 and charged with espionage. This lead to an open political conflict with Bismarck. He demanded the release of Wohlgemuth and rallied his allies behind him. Germany, Russia, and Austria send diplomatic notes to Bern threatening to nullify the statue of Swiss neutrality from 1815 should Switzerland refuse to keep tabs on the political exiles in accordance with their demands. The gist was: Neutrality was a gift from the European powers and as such it could rescinded whenever they wished.  This did not go down well in Switzerland. Enter Paul Schweizer, state archivist of Zürich and historian. Publishing a nine part series in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) in 1889 – which would later become the core of his monumental monography on the subject of Swiss neutraltiy – he started out to oppose the idea that Swiss neutrality was something bestowed upon the Swiss by the European powers but rather something that had a massive deal of history behind it. Because he had virtually no legal argument at his hands, he advanced a historical one that was build upon the idea of imbuing Swiss neutrality with legitimacy independent of  the European powers because of its long and storied (and in many ways not really well-founded) history. As Andreas Suter argued, the idea that Switzerland in the early modern period was a neutral country was ""at its core a response to a monumental foreign policy crisis and a threat by the European powers"".  Following Schweizer's publication and his monograph, the idea of Marignano being the origin of Swiss neutrality that had since been strictly maintained took hold and until this day plays a central role in Swiss political discourse.  However, historiography has long contested the myth of Marignano and neutrality. Emil Usteri in his book *Marignano. Die Schicksalsjahre 1515/1516 im Blickfeld der historischen Quellen.* was the first one to call the narrative into question by re-examining the historical sources following the battle and finding no evidence of a decision to become neutral. In recent years Andreas Suter, Swiss historian at the German university of Bielefeld, has published a lot concerning this question providing further prove that the idea of 500 years of Swiss neutrality is an invented tradition of the late 19th century.

72762	0	a	As a Swiss, thank you very much for this. 
72763	0	a	I'd like to add that it was actually Alexander I the Russian Emperor who was mostly resposible for what happened in the Vienna Congress with Switzerland. He was tutored as a child by Frédéric-César de La Harpe, a politician from the canton of Vaud, who was also a part of the negotiations later on. Without this connection between the two, Switzerland would've probably not remained untouched by the big european powers. He also made sure that the subject territories which became their own sovereign cantons with Napleon's Act of Mediation in 1803 would remain sovereign and cannot be touched by the original sovereign cantons. So this guy basically stabilized Switzerland's foreign and domestic affairs in one swoop.
72764	0	a	As an Austrian, you are welcome.
72765	0	a	Swiss troops were involved in the 30 years war by supplying the French with troops, had several internal conflicts, the Drei Bünde fought the Spanish Habsburgs, and they fought the French in the aftermath of the Revolution which ultimately lead to an end of the old Swiss Confedercy brought about the Helvetian Confederacy under French tutelage and then lead to the congress of Vienna and the creation of Siwtzerland as we know it today.  Swiss troops fighitng for the French (and sometimes Swedes) against the Habsbrugs was something that was among other things the outcome of the peace treaty following Marignano and also in line with Swiss tradition as the Old Swiss Confederacy was basically the result of anti-Habsbrug uprising in these lands.
72766	0	a	It just *had* to be an Austrian eh. Just kidding, I'm glad to have read that as well, very interesting perspective. Allow me to ask though, how did it end with that particular diplomatic crisis? Did Switzerland have to concede? At least by WW1 times they were still hosting Lenin, presumably against the Tzar's will - did the idea of a neutral territory become defendable in the meantime?
72767	0	a	> It just had to be an Austrian eh.   I know, I know...  Also kidding, in order to avert crisis,  Switzerland started keeping tabs on the various political exiles by creating the eidgenössische Generalanwalt (a sort of federal attorney) who directed police to keep tabs on revolutionary activity, foreigners, Roma, and other peoples generally considered dangerous. In 1917 this was expanded with its own section of police and keeping further dossiers about Swiss socialists and other politicians. This practice was continued throughout the Cold War and resulted in 1989 in the so-called Fichenskandal when it became known that Swiss police had 900.000 dossiers (so-called Fiche) on a variety of people, including Swiss citizens.  Basically, they still hosted people like Lenin but did spy on them on behalf of their own police and other powers.
72768	0	a	Aside a brief border fight between Switzerland and Fascist Italy in 1944, Switzerland has not participated in any wars since 1815 and has kept with maintaining strict neutrality.

72770	0	a	"Well, I think I can answer the first half of your question, though I don't know enough to answer the second half beyond the vague familiarity with questions about iconography and iconoclasm that comes with a Catholic upbringing and one year at a Jesuit university, so I think I'll leave that aside and stick to the Islamic half of your question.  Ok, with that being said, let's break this down into constituent parts.  Firstly, I want to answer something that you didn't ask, but is good for background:  1. Why was Muhammad named ""Muhammad"", what does that name mean and how do Arabic names work?  We might actually go back even further and ask an interesting side question of why Muhammad was named Muhammad. Etymologically in Arabic the name ""Muhammad"" means sort of 'one who is praised' or 'one who is praiseworthy'. In pre-Islamic Arabia it seems to have been a highly unusual name for males. My understanding is that all of the surviving examples of other men with the name Muhammad in pre-Islamic Arabia were also holy men. The female version ""Muhammada"" seems to have been much more common. This has even produced some (albeit fringe) speculation that Muhammad might have been an appellation rather than a name as such. I don't buy that, nor is it necessary to.  Etymologically it's also worth noting that as Arabic is a semitic language it works on tri-letter roots, in this case H-M-D, and therefore the name Muhammad is etymologically related and similar in meaning to names like Ahmed, Hamid and Mahmoud.  Also, ""Muhammad"" would not have been Muhammad's only personal name. Arabic names can also include what is known as a Kunya. Most commonly this takes the form of ""Father of X"" with X being your oldest male child. But it can also be an epithet. The first caliph Abu Bakr's name literally means ""Father of Camel Foal,"" but it just means that he spent a lot of time riding camels and had a family that was engaged in herding. Muhammad's kunya was Abu al-Qassim, the father of Qassim, who was his son who died in early childhood.  Arabic names also typically include a patronymic or nasab (ibn Fulan...son of so-and-so). This can string along for as long as is necessary back to whichever ancestor is most relevant for tribal or other purposes. It can also skip generations to get to a more uniquely identifying individual. I'm less familiar with pre-Islamic naming practices but it's also worth mentioning laqabs, which today are often translated as simply surnames but in a pre-modern context could include nickname-like titles, particular for important individuals and rulers, as well as nisbas, which today are likewise often a last name but could also refer to a tribe or place of origin.   I'll come back to this later (and I'm sure one of our native Arabic speakers here will correct me if I've mis-identified part of this) but to take the example of a well-known medieval religious scholar you might have a name like: **Aḥmad** (Ism, or name) **bin Muḥammad** (nasab) **bin Ḥanbal** (nasab) **Abū ʿAbd Allāh** (kunya, i.e. Ahmad's son is named Abdullah) **al-Shaybānī** (tribal nisba, indicating descent from the [Banu Shayban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Shayban)).  --------  Phew, ok, with that background moving into your questions. I'll start with the easier one first:  2 . Why do Muslims name their male children Muhammad?  There's potentially a very long explanation of getting into how exactly these practices developed and whether this was universally true at all times and particularly in the earliest years of Islam, but to cut a long story short, the practice of Islam is based on carrying out God's commandments. Etymologically ""Islam"" means submission to God or to God's will as delivered through the message of his Prophet, the seal of the prophets (i.e. the last and most perfect prophet), Muhammad.  In Islam, the Qur'an is the perfect record of God's speech and revelation to mankind. But very early, in all likelihood during Muhammad's lifetime, it became assumed or presumed that in the absence of a Qur'anic message or commandment, it is best to follow the example of the Prophet in all things, down to the most minute details. Together the collected records of this side of Muhammad's personal life is known as the ""sunna"" and is recorded in the Hadith, and gives its name to ""Sunni"" Islam. NB that Shia Muslims also follow the prophetic example but also believe in following the examples of Ali and his descendants (who are also Muhammad's descendants, as he married Muhammad's daughter, and was incidentally his ~~nephew~~ [edit: h/t /u/asoomdeys ] cousin to begin with).  In any event, included among these hadith are statements by Muhammad suggesting that Muslims name themselves and their children after himself: https://sunnah.com/search/?q=use+my+name  ""Name yourself...?"" you may be asking. Well, one of the traditions in Islam is to take on an Islamic/Arabic name when you convert. It's not 100% guaranteed universal, but was very common.  Also note that Muhammad forbade the use of his Kunya, Abu al-Qassim. Like all religious strictures of course, this one has been broken historically: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Qasim  3 . Why is it that Muslims are opposed to the depiction of Muhammad?  This is slightly more complicated, at least historically or when discussing historical practices. The contemporary sort of Salafist or ultra-orthodox answer is very simple, which is that images of human beings generally are potentially idolatrous. In practice this can be somewhat bi-polar: the Arab Persian Gulf states plaster the faces of their rulers on practically every building, but only put gazelles and coffee-pots on their coinage.  In any event, the concern with images of Muhammad in particular is multifaceted. There is concern that the image of Muhammad is perhaps uniquely susceptible to idolatry and he must therefore, in particular not be depicted. Insofar as it is taken as being commanded against in the religion, depictions of Muhammad are therefore also ipso facto blasphemy. And lastly there is concern that in the case of cartoons or depictions of Muhammad drawn by non-Muslims that these are an assault on the honor of Muhammad (who, as we've discussed, is basically regarded as a perfect human being) and on the religion of Islam itself. It's therefore an incredibly emotive issue.  The more complicated answer would be how that came to be and whether it was always so as /u/FlamingBlankets and /u/Newtothisredditbiz allude to. This is a historiographically complex and deeply debated question, which to my knowledge largely focuses on two distinct periods in Islamic history.  The first is earliest Islamic period. Representational art was not really a feature of pre-Islamic Arabic culture. After the conquest period Muslims apparently adopted representational art quite readily. So you have the frescoes in the [Umayyad desert palaces](https://www.google.ae/search?q=frescoes+umayyad&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQsqSEw8HQAhUKrY8KHXcKCd4Q_AUICCgB&biw=1680&bih=871) or the so-called ""standing caliph"" coins: https://www.google.ae/search?q=standing+caliph+coins&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwil7bCcw8HQAhUKKY8KHQ0EAWYQ_AUICCgB&biw=1680&bih=871  There are lots of questions about this. Were these simply accommodation to pre-existing Greco-Roman and Zoroastrian culture? After all, these coins were clearly modeled on existing Byzantine coinage. Or did something about the depiction of humans in Islamic ideology change fundamentally under Abd al-Malik in the late 7th/early 8th century such that he adopted (or perhaps invented?) the more distinctly ""Islamic"" coinage style: https://attwiw.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/abd-al-malik-coin.jpg (And, indeed, did so in art and architecture as well, as in the construction of the Dome of the Rock.)  To bring this back to Muhammad, in particular, this is complicated by theories that the ""standing caliph"" in those coins might actually be Muhammad himself. This is unresolved, but there are plausible reasons for thinking that it might be.  I'm rapidly running out of space here, but suffice it to say by the end of the reign of Abd al-Malik, Islamic artistic and religious norm was distinctly an-iconic, and there are some really interesting essays and discussions about the interplay and dialogue between Islamic and Byzantine iconoclasm from this period.  The second period, which I'm far less familiar with, relates to the ""Persian Miniature"" tradition (which was also practiced by the Ottomans and Mughals.) I'm far less familiar with the historiography or debates around these images of Muhammad or why they subsequently went out of fashion and so I'll withhold comment.  -------------  Interesting addenda:  One of the features of the above that I find to be interesting is that there are actually far more Muhammad's in the world than many people may realize. Because it is traditional to name sons Muhammad, that obviously isn't an especially useful name to have for identification purposes-- like being named John Smith only much more so. The result in countries like Egypt is that it's very common for men to be named Muhammad but then go by a second name. So to give some well known examples: Anwar Sadat was actually Muhammad Anwar Sadat. Hosni Mubarak is actually Muhammad Hosni Mubarak. The ""Yasser"" in Yasser Arafat is actually an adopted name but he was actually Muhammad Arafat. Etc.  **Sourcewise**  I'm running out of characters and am at work but can post some citations and additional reading later tonight."
72771	0	a	"Okay, I think I can put this together semi-coherently.  Among sixteenth-century holy women and men (saints, wannabe saints, nuns, monks, unaffiliated mystics), there is a particularly Spanish tradition of shedding one's family name to indicate belonging to God instead of an earthly family. So, for example, the Dutch Jesuit-saint Peter Canisius (Latinized *Kanis*) kept his father's name when he joined the Society of Jesus, and Italian Dominican Alessandra de Ricci changed her *first* name in honor of Catherine of Siena but kept the de Ricci family name. But Juan de Yepes y Álvarez changed his name to Juan de San Mateo upon joining the Carmelite order, and went a step further when founding his own stricter monastery, taking on the appellation Juan de la Cruz--John of the Cross. And Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada might be better known today as Teresa of Avila thanks to the location of her convent, but her autobiography is the life of St. Teresa of Jesús.  It's not a rule, of course. Francis Xavier is known by his family's *castle*. But a look at the inquisition records of visionaries and prophets from ~1600 Seville indicates the popularity in Spain of taking on a second name to show possession by God: Ana de los Santos, Antonia de San Francisco (a member of the Franciscan order), Barbara de Jesús, Juan de Jesús ,  Caterina de Jesús, Maria de la Concepcion, Mariana de Jesús.  Much of the religious care in the New World was carried out by members of religious orders like the Dominicans and Franciscans, who, in line with that tradition, were big fans of taking on the names of preferred saints or other religioius things. This religious care included baptism, which brought with it the bestowal of Christian names on Mexican native populations.  In Rebecca Horn's studies of naming patterns among the Nahua as recorded in 16th-17th century census and other records, she traces the gradual triumph of Christian names of Nahuatl ones. Through the mid 16th century, Christian records show a common pattern of a Christian first name and Nahuatl second name for both women and men. In the second half of the century, the pattern starts to slip among women. Nahuatl names fall away, being replaced by Spanish first and second names; men mostly retain the Spanish first, Nahuatl second. Horn insinuates that the growing gender differentiation may reflect a shift from the *use* of Nahuatl names to Spanish ones, but I probably digress.  More relevant here is that in the 17th century, Spanish first and second baptismal names have become the rule for both women and men. Frequently, although not exclusively, the baptizing friar would bestow their own ""de [santx]"" name. Sometimes, especially later in the century, they would follow the pattern of choosing a Christocentric Christian devotion (de la Cruz, de Jesus) instead of their patron saint.  One of Horn's really interesting observations is the growth of a class divide among the Nahua population in the 17th century. Upper-class Mexicans continued to keep the ""de/de la"" form of the name. Its use faded among the lower classes in favor of the simplified name.  So gradually, religious women and men shunning their earthly family names for a divine family became the baptismal names bestowed by a missionary friar. It's clearer to me why upper-class Mexicans would have preferred to preserve the ""de"", but less so why it faded otherwise. Nevertheless, that's the basic progression of the name Jesus from the talisman-like ""IHS"" with quasi-magical powers of the 15th century, to the popular first name Jesús by 1700."
72772	0	a	There were black market merchants, smugglers, counterfeiters, and launderers of goods that they could sell it to. Smuggling probably being the largest one. Not every port was secured or had a harbormaster who cared (bribed) enough against pirates sailing in to sell their goods. If it was, pirates could offload their goods ship to ship or at a beach site, to a more legitimate seeming ship or a smuggler. For goods that did not have any system in place to verify their source, they could simply be sold to any seedy merchant. For goods and ports that were controlled, a more sophisticated system would be needed. The process being sort of similar to modern day money laundering or cigarette smuggling. Pirates takes possession of the goods, then they must get it in condition it can enter the legal market or find a black market buyer. This was usually done by a 3rd party counterfeiter, forger, or merchant. The goal being either to a final consumer who was willing to accept it as black market, or to make it appear legitimate for a consumer who only wants a legitimate good. Piracy was only a small part of the capture/transportation of illegal goods. Many illegal goods began legitimate or were stolen, and became illegal simply because they were smuggled to avoid taxes and duties (or in some cases, only a select few had the rights/privileges of trade).  The respective nations were not incompetent and enacted a plethora of measures to combat both piracy and the trade of illicit/pirated goods. Even in days before electronic monitoring, UPC codes, etc, a lot of goods required stamps, marks, and certification from both goods and merchant. Some measures were somewhat counterproductive, like Spain's mercantilism policies which meant the colonies could only trade with Madrid. This created a black market demand for other European goods.   For some periods there were some less than lawful ports like Nassau and Tortuga which served as pirate havens and markets for illegal goods. More ports fell into a more grey area, where most was legitimate, but some illegal goods were traded. Many more towns and ports were known for smuggling than outright piracy. Cawsand, England was one of them. As time went on and the bureaucracy expanded and the nations and companies had more resources and funds at their disposal they were able to chase pirates out through force and inventory controls.   The actual process of smuggling, mercantilism, and the combating illegal goods would be a large response to questions on their own.

So it might be kind of a surprise that pirates' views of both what constituted loot and what to do with that loot were quite practical.  First, there was always the possibility that the captured ship itself was a prize. When John Duglas captured the nine-man ship *Blue Dove* in 1664, it wasn't nearly good or big enough for his own crew, and the pirates simply locked the other sailors belowdecks and ported away the cargo. But saltwater was hard on the hulls of even good ships, and trading up in terms of size, weaponry, and condition was always tempting. Humphrey Thurston abandoned a ship still worth 300 pounds *as an unsalvageable wreck* (in the Caribbean, where vessels sold for *much* lower rates than in England) when he captured a Spanish man-of-war in 1670.  Although spending by privateers doubled the amount of alcohol sold in Jamaica in the 1660s, pirates were keen to cut out the middleman and use captured cargo as their source of food and liquor. The governor of Jamaica in the late 1660s even complained that privateers never bought actual food from his merchants and farmers! Modyford was grumpy about this, but land-based owners of semi- or not-actually-at-all legit privateer fleets were rather happier that they only had to supply breadstuffs--if that! Pirates intending on a long period at sea would butcher live animal cargo and salt the meat to preserve it for months of use. Sadly, they also killed, salted, and ate the dogs who kept sailors company and helped with pest control on ships.  But the most common fate for captured loot by far, of course, was basic economics: you have product, you sell it. In the heydeys of Caribbean piracy, the sale of booty in pirate-heavy towns was one of the most important factors shaping local day-to-day economy (not just sweeping sugar trade-driven trends). A single, lucrative haul of log-wood in 1667 crashed the price of the commodity in Port Royal for four months. More typical were steady low prices, locally, of things like cocoa and indigo that were sold dog cheap (or rather, ""dogge cheape,"" because early modern English loves you and wants you to be happy).   This was a boon for local traders, of course, who went right on to sell those commodities elsewhere for a significant markup and profit. I have to mention that this was unfortunately true especially for captured slaves. For some reason, local plantation owners had no extra troubles when they treated captured *pirates* who had angered them as slave labor, but slaves seized off ships were called mischief-makers and sold off-island. I've seen it suggested that pirate crews may also have retained specialized slaves for their own use and profit--pearl diving was a specific and valuable skill, and slave-divers were sometimes seized off attacked ships.  Pirates dumped their merchandise-loot into local economies, driving the development of major towns (and also smaller ones, to evade local governments' attempts to stick a hand in their profits). The cash flow back out, even with the dirt cheap prices, should have been enormous. But pirates were the live fast die young sort (a study of 12 privateer captains identified in sources from 1662-63 and again in 1670-73 found that after just a decade, 7 were dead, 1 was in jail, and 4 were petty laborers). And so all that money they received from selling their loot went right back into the pockets of the locals who had exchanged it in the first place.  ...Only to, you know, complain bitterly to anyone who would listen how frequently they were the target of raids from pirates whose way of life, after all, was stealing."

72775	0	a	Think it's important to point out the difference between privateer and pirate. They both did essentially the same things, but privateers were contractors working under commission from various colonies.

72777	0	a	Merchants willing to buy from the black market - who were willing to buy goods that had falsified documents/stamps, or untraceable. Then there were smugglers, too. Goods were not supposed to appear stolen for long, as there was the incentive to be under a facade of legitimacy. It basically came down to anyone willing to risk contraband goods or purchase goods with counterfeit/forged documentation/chain of ownership. Of course not all goods were traceable. More legitimate merchants might use them in the earlier periods, especially if they were English or French and the contraband goods undermined the Spanish power.

72781	0	a	was there some sort of system in place so pirates didn't rob the smugglers and merchants that bought their goods, since that would harm their profits in the long run or did they just know each other? 
72782	0	a	"This is by no means my area of expertise buuuuuuut here goes nothing.   SHORT ANSWER: Like most generalizations about medieval history, it may be broadly true but overlooks change over time and specific nuances that in fact tell a fairly interesting story about the creation of certain institutions. The background for this is the end of the Roman legal system (which in its own way gave power to those with a legal education or the money to access one, to a level that might outstrip the power imbalance of medieval european law) and the creation of the Germanic legal systems (sometimes, as in the case of the Visigoths, with Roman holdovers) in the post-Roman West.   One of the major themes of medieval history (which has been treated at length in the historiography of the period) is the transition from what we might call personal or charismatic law to a system of law that we might see as more modern: nominally impartial, with rights of appeal, etc. This situation is complicated by the fact that the medieval period had many different types of law. Even more than differing national (in the modern, anachronistic sense) laws (e.g., the law of England vs France vs each little part of the Empire) there were overlapping spheres of law. In Visigothic Spain, for instance, there were different ethnic laws for Romans, Goths, Jews, although how this worked in practice is still up for debate. Similarly, in al-Andalus there were complicated rules about who could appeal to which courts in which cases. There were also conflicts between the Church law (canon law) and the secular laws of the lords, which often but not always expressed itself in the debate over what scholars today call ""the papal monarchy.""  With the caveats above--that there are overlapping systems of laws, and that things worked differently in different places, and at different times--we can make some broad arguments about the shift from personal law to institutionalized law. This is tied in with the question of the growth of the administrative state. The simplest argument is that as governments got more complicated and needed things like continuity and cohesiveness, all sorts of things started to happen--taxes needed to be collected, records needed to be kept, plans needed to be made--and all of these eventually created the conditions for centralization and standardization of power. At this time you also see the rebirth of a literate culture, what we sometimes refer to as the ""documentary revolution."" Furthermore, the ""rediscovery"" of Roman Law at the University of Bologna and its spread over the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries provided a model for even those places (like England) which did not adopt Roman law. By the time of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) you had the idea that law needed to be universalized and rationalized, and thus you get the end of things like trial by ordeal.  It is in fact much more complicated than this. Part of this is because of the different levels of hierarchy. An interesting case is England, as described in Strayer's short but thought-provoking *Medieval Origins of the Modern State*. Strayer makes the point that the establishment of many of the things we take for granted in law today--jury trials, appeal, etc.-- came out of royal attempts to undercut the arbitrary power of local lords, and was tied up with the push for more efficient tax collection and the creation of the exchequer. So yes, while in this case there was a move away from what we might call arbitrary personal law (but really--customary law) administered by local lords, the centralization and rationalization (I hate that word) of the law actually served to increase the power of another lord--the King.    Here are some good classic sources: Bartlett, Robert. *Trial by Fire and by Water*  Bisson, Thomas. *The Crisis of the Twelfth Century.*  Cheyette, Frederick. “The Invention of the State.” In Essays on Medieval Civilization, ed.

72783	0	a	"Do you hate the word ""rationalization"" because it doesn't adequetely describe the subject or some other reason?"
72784	0	a	"I don't like it because it adds in our own value judgments of what is and what is not ""rational"" and generally assumes what we think of as rationality to be both right and the thing that historical processes tend towards. A great example, relevant here, is the question of trial by ordeal. Trial by ordeal in its simplest sense is trial by God--or, rather, deferring the judgment to God. One way to do it is the ordeal of the hot iron. The accused grabs a white hot iron that has been blessed etc by a priest. Afterwards the hand is carefully bound, and left for three days. If it's healing ""well,"" the person was innocent; if it's infected, or not healing properly, then they are guilty.   The standard story is that this is a super irrational way of deciding guilt and innocence and that as medieval people because less superstitious and more rational they were able to recognize this until finally they stopped doing it, at which point the Pope said ""ok cool yeah this makes no sense let's stop."" But in fact it's much more complicated. Functionalist scholars have argued that in the cases it was used (murders with no witnesses, adultery, etc) it served a purpose and it served it well--to decide a case that couldn't be decided in any other way, and do it in a way that would stop the conflict from spiraling out of control. It allowed the village to solve its own problems. Others have argued that it worked in other ways--lords liked it because it rendered judgments, and in a brilliant essay, Stephen White showed how often people would propose the deal and then back out of it (or have the other person back out of it). People were using it really shrewdly as a stakes-raising tool. ""Ok, I say this is my field, you say that you made a deal with my father where you could use it, but he's dead now and it's you word against mine--how about one of us grabs the hot iron and we'll see whose field it really is? Oh, you don't want to do it? Well, I guess we know whose field it is now..."" Or even sometimes you would propose an ordeal just to throw them off their game and then come back a day or two later (ordeals take a long time to set up) with a compromise that works for everyone.  Moreover, it seems that ""rationality"" wasn't the reason that ordeals were even banned! They were in fact quite popular right up until the Pope banned them, but a reform party of THEOLOGIANS managed to convince the pope that the ordeal was blasphemous: it was tempting God, because you were in effect asking God to intervene and make a miracle happen, which is super disrespectful and not ok. So that's hwy the Pope banned it--not because they were like ""this is a stupid way to resolve things the infection has more to do with bacteria"" (although there are several treatises on ways to make sure your hand heals well--ointments, creams, etc., which is why the hand needs to be bound by a priest to prevent interference) but because of a religious reason!  That's an example of why I think that the ""rationalization"" of society is a stupid historical concept.

72785	0	a	I think Martin's statement accurately describes some places some times, somewhat. At best, it's partially true for some limited parts in the early middle ages, but fundamentally sweeping generalizations like Martin's are not ones any historian of the middle ages would make. Medieval Law is just too complicated for this, and his terminology is too ill defined.
72786	0	a	Wonderful explanation. Thank you for writing that out. 
72787	0	a	Disclaimer (edited): most of what I'm talking about here is from the perspective of higher society white culture in the North and South. There were some differences in the antebellum South, but little that impacts this specific question because as you'll see if you read the full text it tl;dr, I very strongly suspect the subject is apocryphal* (edit). White plantation ladies hosted parties, entertained their peers, lessers, and leaders, and maintained appearances at all cost.  I have several books and magazines from the era that go into excruciating detail on what to do and not do at parties and I can find no mention of this whatsoever. I've checked my etiquette books from that era and after ([here](https://i.imgur.com/lr6dRI8.jpg) are two [examples](https://imgur.com/KqBkv9S) of later era books I checked, because often etiquette books will recommend *stopping* a practice like that if it's been going on, but no dice), plus a plethora of magazines for anecdotes, stories, etc. I have several years' worth of [Harper's](https://imgur.com/mio3OET) and Chautauqua Society magazines, which have lots of slice-of-life articles and social commentary. Nothing.  I *suspect* this is apocryphal for a few reasons. One, etiquette of the period was more rigid, yes, but more importantly ladies were expected to be social and maintain a level of decorum. For a tiny taste of what I mean, [here's a sample from one of my etiquette books covering general etiquette](https://imgur.com/hS2WwCa). (Sorry about the terrible quality.) Everything was about making others feel at ease, and indeed, that's the theme in every single book and article of the time. Don't be selfish. There's a famous (and possibly apocryphal) story from the era of a society lady who was choking at a dinner party and, rather than embarrass her host, went into the toilet and quietly died. Very Victorian. Mass lady naps during a party just sounds selfish and anti-Victorian. What if a guest wasn't tired? Shall the hostess sleep while her guest stares at the wallpaper? That's a horrifying concept in 1860.  Point two, why? It wasn't the corsets, I can promise you that, especially pre-1880. White women of any means weren't binding themselves into oblivion that early. The corset was a supportive foundation garment and when properly fitted was not uncomfortable or restrictive at all. And keep in mind that they'd been wearing them their entire lives so they were quite used to it. Corsetry had been an established industry for at least a century and even a woman of modest means could afford a decent one; a well-off socialite could choose from the best silk and spiral steel numbers on offer. Even when they did get a bit silly and wasp-waisted in the height of the bustle-era, regular ladies weren't torturing themselves en masse. Well, no more than people do with plastic surgery and extreme body modification today. Those were the elite, the Kardashians. People like me could breathe fine. Speaking of me, here's how I know this: [this is me in a reproduction 1880s French seam corset](https://imgur.com/eDrMZ8z) that I made using authentic period techniques. I've been making and wearing them for 20+ years. It's very comfortable, I can breathe fine, touch my toes, and everything. It's boned with steel. [Here's a new one I'm working on.](https://imgur.com/u8m4e7b) I've been researching and speaking on this topic for decades, but there's also a well-researched [How Stuff Works article](http://people.howstuffworks.com/corset.htm) that's worth a read if you're interested.  That said, is it possible that, in the sweltering heat of the Deep South, some groups of friends or some families may have done this as a habit? Sure. Maybe Margaret Mitchell's own family had this tradition and she extrapolated it to everyone. I just personally doubt it was an institution throughout the southern states. If it were, I'm shocked I can't find a single mention of it outside one work of historical fiction. Edit: I also perused online articles and Google Books.  Is absence of evidence evidence of absence? Maybe not, but I've got about a thousand sentences telling women not to hum in public and far more on the various uses of vibrators to cure hysteria (and they weren't supposed to talk about that). I've also got actual Victorian pornography, which isn't supposed to exist. But I can't find this.  Tl;dr: I've been pretty immersed in this era for a long time and I've never seen a single mention of this outside one work of historical fiction, plus I can't think of a supporting reason for it to be true.

72790	0	a	**Part 1**  So, to answer this as best as possible, there is a bit of context necessary, especially in that both the Allied leadership and the public in Allied countries had been aware of the Holocaust occurring while it was going on and had already started to collect evidence, mainly for the purpose of trials already during the war.  [In this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6696bw/new_understanding_of_allies_knowledge_of_the/) I go into detail concerning Allied knowledge of the Holocaust but in summary, it is imperative to know that Allied government had been aware of the Einsatzgruppen shooting as soon as it started via decrypted documents, had already seen other decrypted documents that went into detail concerning the large scale murder of Jews, had produced aerial reconnaissance photos of the process of cremation going on in Auschwitz and so on. Crucial documentation of what was occurring also came from the governments in exile in London, namely the Polish government with members of the Polish resistance going do far as to infiltrate Auschwitz and smuggle reports to London as well as from the Soviets who held the first war crimes trial in December 1943 and had liberated the first major concentration camp Majdanek in June 1944.  Similarly, the press did report extensively on these matters, just not in places of prominence. The New York Times e.g. [published an article in 2001](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/news/150th-anniversary-1851-2001-turning-away-from-the-holocaust.html) admitting to its own failure to report more prominently on the Holocaust. They wrote:  > Why, then, were the terrifying tales almost hidden in the back pages? Like most -- though not all -- American media, and most of official Washington, The Times drowned its reports about the fate of Jews in the flood of wartime news. Its neglect was far from unique and its reach was not then fully national, but as the premier American source of wartime news, it surely influenced the judgment of other news purveyors. > > While a few publications -- newspapers like The Post (then liberal) and PM in New York and magazines like The Nation and The New Republic -- showed more conspicuous concern, The Times's coverage generally took the view that the atrocities inflicted upon Europe's Jews, while horrific, were not significantly different from those visited upon tens of millions of other war victims, nor more noteworthy. > > (...) > > Only once did The Times devote its lead editorial to the subject. That was on Dec. 2, 1942, after the State Department had unofficially confirmed to leading rabbis that two million Jews had already been slain and that five million more were indeed ''in danger of extermination.'' Even that editorial, however, retreated quickly from any show of special concern. Insisting in its title that Jews were merely ''The First to Suffer,'' it said the same fate awaited ''people of other faiths and of many races,'' including ''our own 'mongrel' nation'' and even Hitler's allies in Japan if he were to win the war.  Following the less than enthusiastic coverage of this topic, on March 9,1943, screenwriter and Zionist Ben Hecht staged the play *We Will Never Die* in Madison Square Garden in front of 40.000 people in order to raise awareness of the plight of European Jews and then further traveled around the US with it, even winning over Frank Sinatra to participate.  In Britain too – though complicated by British media laws – the public was aware of what was going on if they chose to read the newspapers. The Daily Telegraph reported in 1942 about [traveling gas chambers](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/27/1422356585641/ab29aa28-7ed8-4c38-a45d-dc0b13072e01-bestSizeAvailable.png?w=300&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=422223adda84a80fa704ab4e1d4c2ff8), which given that the Einsatzgruppen did indeed use gas vans is surprisingly accurate. Simon Leader's 2004 [PhD Thesis on the British regional press and the Holocaust](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42016442.pdf) (pdf warning) shows that  > [British] newspapers were fully aware of the Nazis’ intention to murder all Jews under their control by December 1942. They all reported the events that came to be understood as the Holocaust, (some in extraordinary detail) but the Manchester Guardian stood apart because of the consistency of its coverage.  The reason, why Allied governments did act they way they did or did not act at all on this knowledge is varied and complicated but it is a fact that both an interested public and the governments of various Allied countries were very, very aware of what was occurring.  Nonetheless, the discovery of the camps and seeing the consequences of Nazi policy in the form of starved and beaten humans was a shock to those who experienced it and it was really only then – when confronted with the bloody consequences – that the troops liberating those camps as well as leadership such as Eisenhower became fully aware of the utmost criminal nature of the Nazi state.  Efforts to document these crimes had already been in place when the Americans liberated the first camps they came across. [As I detail in this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/74zl84/why_did_nazis_try_to_destroy_their_concentration/), the Allies had since 1941 expressed their goal of putting the persons responsible for war crimes on trial and had since 1943 with the foundation of the United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes created a framework for the collection and documentation of these crimes.  It was this agency and its affiliated agencies within the US Army in form of the US Army's War Crimes Branch that contributed a lot to the documentation of Nazi crimes that was presented to the public almost immediately after Eisenhower and other Allied leaders had expressed their desire to do so. The US Army had a very infrastructure for producing war reports during WWII (think Robert Capa's famous photographs of D-Day or movies shot by famous directors during the invasion of Italy) and this infrastructure together with the war crimes investigators started producing material for presentation to Allied and Germany publics alike almost immediately.  Reporters from various outlets were invited to visit liberated camps almost immediately to write about what they witnessed. Heavy hitters from the press produced reports and newsreels on what they saw there, e.g. [Edward R. Murrows report on the liberation of Buchenwald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3SCSouI8WE) that was available to the Allied public shortly after the liberation of the camp. Even the Soviets followed a similar model with famous Soviet writers such as Vissily Grossmann writing the text [The Hell called Treblinka](https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-human-behavior/hell-of-treblinka-vasily-grossman). Famous movie directors were engaged to shot documentaries about the Holocaust: Resnais [Night and Fog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAakK4X2_0o) was a movie that used the footage of liberation shot immediately after the war. Alfred Hitchcock [shot a Holocaust documentary](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock) that was never shown but still shows the efforts that went into this documentation.  Similarly, the Allied commanders in Germany also wanted to confront the German public who largely claimed to have known nothing about this with the crimes of their regime: Germans from surrounding villages and cities were forced to bury the dead in camps and were regularly forced to watch movies about the Holocaust and Nazi war crimes by Allied commanders.  The largest efforts at documentation however were certainly the Allied post-war trials like the IMT in Nürnberg, the subsequent NMT trials, the Buchenwald trial by the British, the Dachau Trials by the Americans and so on and so forth. Nürnberg wasn't just to put the Nazi leadership on trial but also a conscious effort at documenting what the Nazis had wrought. The trial itself was filmed all the way, the documents and transcripts were published, media attention was enormous and even the selection of NMT trials was designed to highlight how every aspect of the Nazis had been criminal: Hence a doctor's trial, a jurist trial, a general's trial and so on and so forth.  So efforts to document and make that documentation available to the public immediately were made extensively and succeeded heavily in getting the information out there. 
72791	0	a	"**Part 2**  As for **question number 2**: I have gone into the history of Holocaust denial in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/68uu11/how_prevalent_is_holocaust_denial_and_how_does_it/) and first efforts definitely appeared directly after the war. One effort was closely tied to the West German governement's effort [to push the Clean Wehrmacht myth](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5799li/did_the_rommel_myth_and_clean_wehrmacht_myth_and/d8suoyk/) and re-integrate former Nazis into German society as well as the efforts of those Nazis that minimized numbers and responsibility. But there were others too.  Another political agenda that used Holocaust denialism as its tool right after the war, was a certain strand of proto-fascist and right-wing extremist thinkers who wanted to clean fascism and their ideology from the strain of being associated with Hitler and the Holocaust. Douglas Reed is such an example. Reed, who was a prominent journalist in Great Britain, was against Hitler but not against Nationalsocialism (he favored the Otto Strasser position). In the late 40s, early 50s he started publishing books which claimed Hitler had been a Zionist agent and his policy of killing the Jews was a Jewish plot to justify the creation of Israel and which was done against the wishes of many Nazis. At some point it became increasingly hard for him to find publishers, so he moved to South Africa and became involved in supporting apartheid politics in SA and Rhodesia.  Another -- and rather odd -- strand of denialism comes from a pacifists. Pacifism had been very popular during the time between the World Wars because of the effects of WWI and after World War Two, a couple of people of the radical pacifist movement saw their positions threatened because the crimes of the Nazis were a major reason why the war against Nazi Germany was portrayed as a moral and necessary war. In the United States, a former mainstream historian and pacifist activist, Harry Elmer Barnes, started publishing literature that claimed the Holocaust was an Allied invention to justify their war against German, which they had started in 1939.  All in all though, Holocaust Denial as we know it today, meaning the total denial of all that occurred while presenting itself as ""scientific"" work is a phenomenon of the 70s since even at the IMT people like Göring didn't outright deny what had occured but rather were keen on deflecting responsibility of it to others not present with Hitler, Himmler, and Eichmann being favorites.  As for **question number 3**: The Dachau reprisals are the only known such reprisal killing by American troops after the war.  When liberation had become inevitable, several guards in Dachau tried to disguise themselves as prisoners in order to escape being arrested. According to several accounts several prisoners of the camp took offense to that and started basically beating them to death under the eyes of the American troops. Similarly, the US troops in Dachau killed a number of former guards by executing them on the spot.  After finding 29 box cars full with about 2000 skeletal corpses, an unknown number, estimates range from 35-50, of guards was summarily executed by the American troops at Dachau. The US Army investigated the incidents and briefly considered to put the responsible members of the Army before a court martial but then gave up on the idea considering a proper defense would have included finding box cars full of dead skeletal corpses with according to several testimonies ""brain matter scattered around"" and the information that basically the people in these box cars had been stuffed in there by these guards and they in effect let them starve.  As for the impact liberation had on soldiers and commanders, Susan L. Carruthers' recent book *The Good Occupation* offers insight into the thinking of regular American soldiers and officers when confronted with the liberation and we have a similar wealth of accounts from the British liberation of Buchenwald. The overarching tenor is the horror and helplessness they experienced, especially in Buchenwald where in the weeks following liberation several thousand prisoners perished due to the effects of starvation and disease until the British managed to get the situation under control. I write more about Buchenwald [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6h4srl/during_the_liberation_of_concentration_camps_at/) but as far as long term studies of the impact go, I am not aware of any (that isn't to say that there aren't, just that I am not well-versed in psychological literature in the field).  Tying also into **question 4**, these resources, especially Carruthers' book do deal with the impact on Jewish soldiers and the sources they left behind. You can find a lot of those [on the USHMM website where survivors and liberators detail their stories of liberation in form of written accounts and interviews](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/gallery.php?ModuleId=10005131&MediaType=oi).   As for **question number 5**: I believe that what I have shown above shows how much care and effort the various Allied governments put into the documentation of the Holocaust: Press reports, systematic collection of evidence, trials, all these went a long way to spread this knowledge and to build a basis for the vast amoutns of scholarship we have today. In this sense, the emergence of Holocaust denial is certainly not tied into the lack of documentation of these crimes. It wasn't then and it isn't know.  Rather Holocaust Denial originates with with a clear ideologically driven agenda that bends and ignores the truth in service of fascist and Nazist ideology, especially as the emergence of its modern form in the 60s and 70s shows and its close ties to neo-fascism and neo-nazism shows. Holocaust Denial was inevitable in as far as these ideologies continued to exist and were on occasion even used for political purposes in the Cold War. But that they experienced such a resurgence in the 90s and even today has to do with other factors rather than the lack of documentation since there isn't a lack of documentation and there never was really.  **Edit**: I was writing this answer before you edited your question text, so here's some more answer on what you were asking:  The initial concern of Eisenhower was, as far as we can reconstruct it, not so much prompted by any outright denial he witnessed on part of the Americans and British publics – the Germans were another matter – but by the lack of care for the issue during the war. He had been privy to a lot of the info that I mentioned above that showed that the Allied leadership knew about the Holocaust but did not really take it in consideration during war time. Additionally, it is important to understand the context behind it: Eisenhower had just witnessed and fought a war against a regime that was masterful at bending and distorting the truth and was hyper-aware that this occurred only 20 years after the last war against Germany. While the Allies took every step to ensure to document these crimes, nobody was certain about the future of fascism as an ideology. Would it resurface? Would it make a huge comeback in post-war Europe or elsewhere? Hence, the documentation of these crimes was a large emphasis for him and others as a means to prevent this ideology from ever becoming popular again.  As for his presidency, Eisenhower oversaw the last stretch of the Displaced Persons System in Germany and repatriation and emigration of the last Holocaust survivors. According to his daughter, he also kept some photographs of the liberation of camps where he was present at his bookshelve but in terms of actual policy, it needs to be acknowledged how  context had changed. Eisenhower was a Cold War president and the Soviet threat loomed large on the mind of the American public with the atrocities of the last war and their remembrance taking a back seat to this new threat. Pam Parry in her book *Eisenhower: The Public Relations President* however makes the point that some of the most remembered aspects of the Eisenhower presidency, including his condemnation of the military-industrial complex were in parts shaped by a staunch sense of morality influenced by the war and atrocities he had witnessed.  And Eisenhower certainly testified, not in front of congress but in public through press releases, his orders, and his speeches in 1945 which directly tackled what he had personally seen head-on. In a press conference in 1945 he said:  > When I found the first camp like that I think I never was so angry in my life. The bestiality displayed there was not merely piled up bodies of people that had starved to death, but to follow out the road and see where they tried to evacuate them so they could still work, you could see where they sprawled on the road. You could go to their burial pits and see horrors that really I wouldn't even want to begin to describe. I think people ought to know about such things. It explains something of my attitude toward the German war criminal. I believe he must be punished, and I will hold out for that forever.  and the [Eisenhower library keeps a further list of public utterances and reports of Eisenhower on the Holocaust](https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/holocaust.html).

72840	0	a	I'd just like to add in a bit about the jail part. I had an ex boyfriend who had me drive to a bank while he robbed it, and i found out when he got back to the car. I didnt report it because he was an intimidating person, and i was scared. So i was complicit in the act, and am now carrying out my sentence. The judge was understanding and i didnt get too terrible of a sentence, seeing as i didnt go to prison. Its been really hard on me, but im using this as a learning experience about people, and am more cautious with who i associate with. Thank you to everyone for all of your kind words! I really needed this. :)

72843	0	a	_clinks glass with fork, clears throat, and raises glass_  Hello everyone we are here today to toast /u/SL33PY_K8 and her newly acquired freedom after time served.  You have served that time and you are free. From where I am standing you didn’t just serve a year of jail, it sounds like you had you soul tortured being a woman and forced into a jail filled with men. That’s not jail, that’s not prison, that is Hell.   I am truly sorry you had to experience that. No woman should have to do so. That single year probably felt like 100 years. I weep at that the very thought that we would do that to you. Just because someone may have made a mistake that had them sent to jail, does not mean we should treat them like less of a human when we do. What happened to you is not a reflection of you, but of a broken system.  But again you are free and that is a thing worth celebrating! I know that sometimes it is difficult to keep depression away, but please do not let it cage you when you finally have were let out of the cage. Do not let it turn you into some canary in the coal mine that it snuffs out. Be free and be the beautiful songbird that you are. Notice that you walked out of the cage already. Know your wings aren’t clipped and you can fly. You can sing. You can be free.  Cheers to being free beautiful songbird. Cheers to being a strong woman that survived 100 years in hell from this human’s perspective. Cheers to the strength of a woman that few men ever understand.  _clinks glass with closest toaster_

72848	0	a	"I may be a bit wrong, but jail is a temporary holding. So if you get arrested and can't come up with bail (a court decided amount of non refundable money that acts as a promisary for your return to trial) they will hold you in jail until your trial. In jail you are housed with a mix of people with crimes varying from small infractions to murder. Sometimes trials can take months and sometimes days. If you don't end up bailing out before your trial you can sometimes be sentenced to ""time served"" which means the time you spent in jail while awaiting trial is your punishment.  Prison on the other hand is where you go after sentencing. Here you get to enjoy the company of people who may be sentenced to life, or maybe just a few months. The crimes can vary wildly but they are considered ""serious"". Prisons have different types of security and inhumane treatment. 10/10 would not recommend."

72856	0	a	I understand. I feel the last sentence. I will probably spend my birthday tomorrow alone, too.  Someone does care, though. Even if they never say it. It could be simply someone looking for the greeting or smile you give them when you see them. But you would be missed. Take some time to sort through what you want from life and what makes you feel better about yourself or makes you happy.   I feel like a hypocrite giving this advice, but I am trying to spend my time alone as time to learn about myself and what I want.
72857	0	a	I'll be the first to say it - Happy Birthday.  I know this has been a rough day for you.  It is awesome that you like music.  Slayer kicks ass.  Do you like movies too?  Or TV?  There are a lot of really good movies and TV series out there right now since all of the streaming services are launching new stuff.  Let me know if you want some suggestions.  Quick story - I was getting a haircut at Sport Clips yesterday and my stylist asked if I was going to subscribe to Disney+.  I told her yes and we started talking about Star Wars, then Marvel movies, then TV shows like Ozark, Dexter, It's Always Sunny and more.  We talked the whole time about our favorite movies and TV shows.  At the end of the haircut she gave me her number.  Sometimes the best connections can come from less than obvious places and a simple conversation starter can get things going in the right direction.  You will find someone and your next birthday will be much better.  You got this!
72858	0	a	You’d be surprised at who you will hurt if you took your own life.  God knows I thought I wouldn’t be missed when I attempted.  Just don’t do it.   I know it’s hard not thinking about it and it feels like everything has lost its color and there’s that numbness that makes even genuine contact feel fake but I promise if you that if you can hang in there a bit longer it does get better.  I’d recommend a therapist.  They’re nice people and even better, sometimes they have meet ups where other people like us meet up and try to reconnect with activities.  I know it seems strange to try and find comfort with strangers, especially ones that are struggling with their own demons but, it does make it an even playing field when trying to talk.  Even if you don’t see one, know that you’re not alone and your life is a gift.  You never know how you might be a blessing for someone else that is suffering and you certainly will never know if you end it now.  You may be sad and alone on your birthday now but you are not defeated because you haven’t lost the will to search for meaning by posting here.  You are strong.  You can keep going and one day, in the not too distant future, you’re going to look back on this moment and say that past you sure had the balls to kick this feeling in the ass and have an amazing life.  It gets better and I know you can do it! It just takes time and so far you’ve done a stellar job thus far. You got this!
72859	0	a	The only thing that makes me feel better about myself is music but even that is starting to lose its meaning.   For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

72861	0	a	The fact that even in your moments of darkness, you are willing to console someone else shows that you are a good person.   You are setting a good example for people who visit this post to see. Never underestimate how even small acts can lead to great change in others and know that WE NEED YOU HERE. You contribute much more than you think.   Rock on, my friend.
72862	0	a	If I may make a suggestion, try meditation. Not the normal one that many people talk about (3 major different kinds of meditation). There is one with letting your mind empty and whatever thoughts show up run their course (as in let the thought happen and let it go, don't force the thought to stay or delve deeper unless it does so naturally).  It was hard for me to do at first but it helps with finding out anything subconscious that is holding you back.

When he's done at work he comes home to two happy and healthy toddlers who call him Daddo. He cooks a delicious meal for his family (because his wife is a terrible cook), and plays with his kids. He is the kind of guy who got his BA while working full time and raising a family. He's the funny guy. He's the smart guy. Daddo is the kind of guy we all wish was our dad growing up. He is the best.  Edit: I'm blown away by the likes my comment has gotten. Thank you, reddit, for loving my husband!

72872	0	a	You look sweet. Like the kind of guy I’d have fun with at a water park in the lazy river. I know it’s easier said than done, but try not to worry about it too much! Your friends are your friends. If something happens and you lose one or find out one didn’t actually like you, then it’s okay! All it means is more room for more friends and more doors to more opportunities. 
72873	0	a	Oh my gosh, I leave this for a few hours and there's so much nice things people say!! I'm always shy and scared to go for someone, but thanks for making me smile! Means so much to me. (I totally forgot I turned 17 two weeks ago) 
72874	0	a	Your eyes and your smile look so kind. I actually smiled myself and I was feeling pretty down so thank you. Wish you the best of luck and to be surrounded by great people.

You're just experiencing that part of it two decades later. But listen to this, too--you are a brave, amazing person. Doing all this, getting a degree, taking care of your woof friend, all on your own. You think of it as being single, I say it means you're determined and ambitious. Keep at it. You're amazing.
72879	0	a	I'd put a ring on it.
72880	0	a	Thank you 😢
72881	0	a	Hiya endo friend!   I have endo as well. In fact,  an estimated 1/10 women do. That means you are not alone in this. There are lots of support groups including one on Reddit and you are more than welcome there!   I know it’s hard to hear that you have a disease-especially one that includes chronic pain. I promise you will learn how to live with it. Not only live-but thrive. There are a lot of different options for us and I know quite a bit. If you ever wanna talk, just shoot me a message. I’d be happy to share the things I have learned. After about a decade of pain (wasn’t diagnosed until last year), I’ve finally figured out how to keep it in check.   Keep your head up. Research on endo has really only just begun and many women find options that work very well for them. *Don’t ever forget that you are a strong human being* and don’t let anybody tell you that you are exaggerating or crazy. You’re not. All the feelings you have are warranted and understandable and I really empathize with you. It will get better. You’ve only just started the journey of treating it, your first step was a diagnosis. **But it can only get better from here.**  By the way, your bangs look great and you have kind eyes.  Edit: Cute stationary. I love hello kitty.
72882	0	a	You're beautiful inside and out. Nothing can stop you. It's just a set back and shall pass. Chin up gal, you are fantastic.
72883	0	a	You hair is beautiful! And you look like a genuine soul. Even if it doesn’t last forever, cherish this hopeful feeling now
72884	0	a	If you can attempt cacti and succulents at the same time, you'll be fine.
72885	0	a	You absolutely rock those glasses. I'm really sorry to hear about your cousin. Please be patient with yourself. It's been a month, less than 1/900th of your life, and this was someone really close to you. Give yourself some time to recover, you need it right now. No feeling lasts forever, not your current happiness, and not the underlying grief. I promise you that even if it doesn't last long this time, you will feel this happiness and hope again, in time. So don't fear, and instead, enjoy the good feelings while they're here! You deserve to feel happy! Congrats on feeling hope, and I hope that hope finds you again and again and again, indeed I have full faith that it will, so soak it in, savor it, and believe it, the hope will come again, you will keep finding it, I promise!
72886	0	a	Thank you. I will endeavour to do the best I can at that

From the look of your face, you made a first step by posting here and that’s a start of becoming a stronger person both emotionally and mentally.  What I want to say is that you MATTER, OP and you have a lot to offer to this table.  You also come across as someone who gives so much love and that’s a very important quality.  Whoever your future partner in your future relationship will be so LUCKY to have you as a most loving person.  Remember, and as the first commentator stated, don’t you ever think that it is you but more towards the other person.  Keep shining yourself bright like a diamond, OP!

72919	0	a	"Hey! First of all, let me tell you that I know how you feel, since I went through the same twice, even though it was some years ago with 12 and 15.  So I absolutely can relate to your resignation, frustration and overall apathy towards taking any action to change anything.  The despair and anxiety that comes with it is truly one of the most horrible things I can imagine and I still haven't overcome it yet. But please believe me if I say, that it'll get better as time goes on, as long as you try changing things and getting better. A thikg my dad told me once and that helped me a lot:  There will be meltdowns. There will be setbacks. There will be days and weeks in which you feel as if nothing is moving forward, that you have made no progress at all, and that is absolutely normal and natural. But don't ever forget that there isn't just ""feeling great"" and ""feeling crushed and devastated"", there are hundreds of millions of shades in between. Every step you make towards the ""feeling great"" side of the spectrum is a success. Even if yiu have a meltdown and go so many steps back, you always have to stand up and keep walking. Even if 99 attempts fail, it'll be worth every drop of sweat and tear you lost on your journey when the 100th attempt succeeds.   It isn't easy. You won't be over it in just a few month or years. But it'll get better, step by step. Even if it takes babysteps. No matter how painful reality is, it is all over once you stop trying to change how things are.  there will be despair, nights where you wake up crying, in the middle of a panic attack, days where you feel as if everything you do is a farce and that you are a burden to everyone around you. Again, it is natural that those thoughts come up, but never let them fully corrupt you   I don't know if you are the same as me, but one of the things that made me desparate was the thought that nobody fully understands how I feel. But that is not the point. That is to some degree a good thing. Having someone fully understand you would most likely end  in them breaking down as well. It is a GOOD thing to have people who don't see the whole picture, who bring another perspective to it, who see it maybe from a much more positive side. Don't focus so much on what others don't understand than rather what they may understand and wzat other perspectives they bring into the whole situation.  You are truly beautiful and have such an amazingly adorable, well proportioned face all while beeing so skilled in your paintings/drawings to such an impressive dwgree (I'm sorry if that comes across creepy, I went through your post history)  I'm sure that a smile from you with your face and appereance would look absolutely stunning and gorgeous! I hope you'll cope with it well and show the world your smile more often.  I wish you the best for your future and am sure you'll overcome this whole incident someday!"
72920	0	a	I am so sorry you had to experience that. But please know, it was not your fault, you are absolutely not worth less after that.  You are a truly beautiful young woman, who has experience one of the worst things I can imagine. You are still here, and everyone around you cherish you.This traumatic experience will take time to heal, and will not be easy. But if anyone can do it, its you! Just dont be afraid to ask for help, I am sure family, friends and professionals WANT to help you, and if you feel like you just need to talk to a stranger who doesnt know you, one you dont know, and who you dont have to talk to ever again unless you feel like it, please just send me a PM, Id be more than happy to talk to you, no judging, no expectations, no nothing except a friend you have never met!  You are beautiful, and the world is a brighter place for all of us, because of you !  And such a talented artist. Wow !
72921	0	a	It's clear you have an amazing artistical talent.  I especially love the energy from the sketch of how anorexia/depression feels.  There is something there that tugs at the very soul of the viewer.  The world would be a lesser place without you in it, and you share a tremendous beauty with it.  If nothing else, we love you and offer our healing energy from afar.  You can do it.

And on top of being strong you are absolutely beautiful, still striving to get an education, not to mention them perfect eye brows and pretty handwriting.  Just keep going, things will always be up and down, but nothing is impossible and you’ve already proven you can face the worst life can throw at you. The ups will feel that much better knowing the struggle you went through to reach them.

72939	0	a	Depression sucks. I've been battling it for sixteen years. It gets exhausting and after all that time you think you'll never get better. I finally started to go to therapy this year and its made a world of difference. You can't fix something very well if you don't have the right tools, and therapy is about teaching you the right tools. Think of it like doing physical therapy for an injury.  My boyfriend lost his brother to suicide so I've also seen what it's like from the otherside. I know you're brain might try to trick you into thinking people would be better off without you or that you won't be missed, but I promise you, someone would.  Hopefully this tool might be some help, https://www.verywellmind.com/ten-cognitive-distortions-identified-in-cbt-22412

The day before yesterday I was feeling really low and doubting myself. You guys truly lifted me up with your kind words, advice and compliments. So thank you thank you thank you, everyone who took time out of their day just to make me feel better. I didn‘t intend or expect for that post to blow up like it did. A lot of people who found it on their front page left one or two nasty comments - so a special thank you to the mods for reacting quick and deleting comments before they got any attention and also to those of you who reached out to me through other social media platforms to make sure that I read the messages and comments!🖤 You guys are just amazing. That post will be my little happy place to go to when I‘m not feeling good about myself. I‘m glad the internet has a corner where we can be vulnerable and unapologetically positive🖤

There is always a reason to keep going x
72972	0	a	However bad life gets, there is never a good enough reason to give up. Sadness and pain are fleeting things in life and you will feel happy again. You must be brave to post a picture of you showing weakness, not a lot of people would, me included so I really respect you for that. Stay strong OP, things will get better

72975	0	a	"My heart aches for what you're currently going through. Even if I don't know the details, I can see in your eyes what I used to catch in the mirror every single day. It's a sorrow not many are able to truly understand and speak openly about, and I'm proud you've been courageous enough to post here and reach out to us.   About this time last year I intended to end my life on the first of June. I truly felt that there was absolutely nothing the world could offer me, that things would not grow less bleak, that I had run out of reasons. I felt like I was far too aware of the concept of pointlessness, and that I would never be able to escape from it, that nothing could ever fill the awareness of life being 'meaningless'.  As you can see, I'm still alive (not a ghost typing to you), and I've found it incredibly difficult to guide people to their own individual sense of purpose. I have a lot of friends who struggle with suicidal thoughts and attempting to show them what I've started to see in life doesn't tend to be particularly helpful. It simply doesn't fit two people the same way. For me, as vague and simple as it sounds, the reason I didn't kill myself was because of the night sky. The idea that the specks I were seeing were distant objects beyond my comprehension that were still entirely mysterious... just *did it* for me, I guess. From there my own curiousity about the world blossomed and now I couldn't imagine leaving it.  I promise I'm not trying to pull the whole ""wow I'm cured"" type thing, but I found it helpful to hear what helped others, and I thought I might as well leave it here in case it helps you or somebody else in some way.   I can tell just by this post that you're gorgeous, brave, strong, and have a massive amount of heart. These are traits the world needs more of, and the world would miss these dearly. It's so hard at times like these, but I would like to gently request one thing: in even one singular, tiny way, try to be kind to yourself. I know for a fact you deserve it and if I could be there in person I would do the kind thing myself, but I can't, so I was hoping you could do it for me :) don't feel bad if you aren't able to, but even if it's just getting a glass of water, or a snack, or thinking a kind thought about yourself, that is absolutely enough.   I really want things to feel better for you soon, and I'll be keeping you in my thoughts."
72976	0	a	It sounds like you still have reasons to keep going. Even if it's just a few, remember that you'll always be able to find new reasons to keep going. You are very young and I'm sure there are good things waiting for you, if you can just pull through now. You have a very kind face and I'm sure there are people who love you, maybe more than you know. And if you are alone, well, that is not permanent, I promise you. Take a hug! :-)

72981	0	a	You look fucking great man! I'm sorry about your wife, but keep working on yourself and your kids so that years from now they can look back and reminisce on how much their dad cared for them and spent time with them despite their mother's actions. You look badass man, much love from across the pond.
72982	0	a	First - you look FUCKING FANTASTIC, dude.  Whatever you are doing (stress driving it or otherwise) - keep it up!  You are looking lean as hell and all sorts of defined.  It is a TOTAL cliche to say - but it is true. Time will heal this wound. I **KNOW** that sound like bullshit right now. But it is true.  BE THERE for your kids and (equally as important) yourself.  I know it is probably the last thing you want to think about right now but....get to work on moving on from your wife. She obviously (for whatever reason(s) does not want to be in the marriage. Let her go. Not for kindness to her....but kindness to yourself.   You deserve to have someone in your life that WANTS to be in you life as much as you want to be in theirs.  Stay strong, drive on (for you and the kids) and kick the shit out of life, brother!

Not sure I'll be able to go through with it, or if she's willing, but something I've given thought to after never ever considering it before.  The shock is still there, so I'm not 100% sure I'm ready to make a decision yet.

72992	0	a	I'll try to summarize it. My half brother drop out college, had a son and adopted a girl from the old partner of his now ex girlfriend. His son was born deaf, he wasn't very dedicated to any of his job so he struggled to stay in one for too long. For that period of time my mother cover the medical expenses of my nephew, included a surgery to install an ear implant. My mother offered my half brother another chance in college, she'd pay everything this time, last time my dad paid. My half brother changed from career once and then drop out again, leaving my mother with the immense debt of the medical expenses and the payments of college. My mother made an arrangement with a bank to buy all of her debts so she would only have to pay to the bank. And so she did but in the meantime, she kept helping my half brother with his finances, further increasing her debt, to the point where we are now. The bank is about to seize us, there was a huge fight a couple nights ago. My mother has the tendency to escalate conflict and then complain about how we don't do things as she wants. I can't tell for sure, but I think she might be borderline or has  undiagnosed I. E. D. She is also depressed. I think that if everything goes south me and my dad are going to live with my aunt or my grandmother  Edit: can into can't
72993	0	a	Hello Professor Hawking,  If we discovered a civilisation in the universe less advanced than us, would you reveal to them the secrets of the cosmos or let them discover it for themselves? 
72994	0	a	Hi Professor Hawking. Thank you very much for agreeing to this AMA!  First off I just wanted to say thank you for inspiring me (and many others I'm sure) to take physics through to university. When I was a teenager planning what to study at university, my mother bought me a signed copy of your revised version of “A Brief History of Time” with your (printed) signature, and Leonard Mlodinow’s personalised one. It is to this day still one of my most prized possessions, which pushed me towards physics - although I went down the nuclear path in the end, astronomy and cosmology still holds a deep personal interest to me!  My actual question is regarding black holes. As most people are aware, once something has fallen into a black hole, it cannot be observed or interacted with again from the outside, but the information does still exist in the form of mass, charge and angular momentum. However scientific consensus now holds that black holes “evaporate” over time due to radiation mechanisms that you proposed back in the 70s, meaning that the information contained within a black hole could be argued to have disappeared, leading to the black hole information paradox.   I was wondering what you think happens to this information once a black hole evaporates? I know that some physicists argue that the holographic principle explains how information is not lost, but unfortunately string theory is not an area of physics that I am well versed in and would appreciate your insight regarding possible explanations to this paradox!
72995	0	a	"Professor Hawking,   While many experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence and robotics are not immediately concerned with the notion of a Malevolent AI [see: Dr. Rodney Brooks]( http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/), there is however a growing concern for the ethical use of AI tools. This is covered in the research priorities document attached to the letter you [co-signed](http://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf) which addressed liability and law for autonomous vehicles, machine ethics, and autonomous weapons among other topics.    •	What suggestions would you have for the global community when it comes to building an international consensus on the ethical use of AI tools and do we need a new UN agency similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure the right practices are being implemented for the development and implementation of ethical AI tools?   "
72996	0	a	Hello Professor Hawking, thank you for doing this AMA!   I've thought lately about biological organisms' will to survive and reproduce, and how that drive evolved over millions of generations. Would an AI have these basic drives, and if not, would it be a threat to humankind?   Also, what are two books you think every person should read?
72997	0	a	"This was a question proposed by one of my students:   Edit: since this got some more attention than I thought, credit goes to /u/BRW_APPhysics  - do you think humans will advance to a point where we will be unable to make any more advances in science/technology/knowledge simply because the time required to learn what we already know exceeds our lifetime?  Then follow-ups to that:  - if not, why not?  - if we do, how far in the future do you think that might be, and why?  - if we do, would we resort to machines/computers solving problems for us? We would program it with information, constraints, and limits. The press the ""go"" button. My son or grandson then comes back some years later, and out pops an answer. We would know the answer, computed by some form of intelligent ""thinking"" computer, but without any knowledge of how the answer was derived. How might this impact humans, for better or worse?"
72998	0	a	Dear Professor Hawking,  If you were 24 or 25 today and just starting your research career, would you decide to work in physics again or would you study something else like artificial intelligence? 
72999	0	a	Hello Professor Hawking and thank you for coming on for this discussion!  A common method for teaching a machine is to feed the it large amounts of problems or situations along with a “correct“ result.  However, most human behavior cannot be classified as correct or incorrect.  If we aim to create an artificially intelligent machine, should we filter the behavioral inputs to what we believe to be ideal, or should we give the machines the opportunity to learn unfiltered human behavior?  If we choose to filter the input in an attempt to prevent adverse behavior, do we not also run the risk of preventing the development of compassion and other similar human qualities that keep us from making decisions based purely on statistics and logic?  For example, if we have an unsustainable population of wildlife, we kill some of the wildlife by traps, poisons, or hunting, but if we have an unsustainable population of humans, we would not simply kill a lot of humans, even though that might seem like the simpler solution.
73000	0	a	"**How important do you think [simulating] ""emotion""/""empathy"" could be within the context of AI?**     More specifically, do you think that a lack of emotion would lead to:  1.  **inherently logical and ethical behavior** (e.g. Data or Vulcans from Star Trek)  2.  **self-centered sociopathic behavior** characteristic of human beings who are less able to feel ""emotion""/""empathy"" (e.g. Hal9000 from 2001) 3.  **combination of the two**  Thanks for taking the time to do this.   *A Brief History of Time* was one of my favorite books in high school set me on the path to become the scientist I am today."

73003	0	a	Hello sir, thank you for the AMA. What layperson misconception would you most want to be rid of?
73004	0	a	"Dear Professor Hawking, My name is Zoe and I am a sixteen year old living in Los Angeles.  I am a long time Girl Scout (11 years) and am now venturing forth unto my Gold Award.  The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award in girl scouting, it is equivalent to the Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts.  It teaches a lot of life skills with research, paperwork and interviews, but also with hosting workshops and reaching out to people. The project requires at least 80 hours of work, which I find less daunting then making the project leave a lasting affect (which is the other big requirement of the project).  To do that, I am creating a website that will be  a lasting resource for years to come.  For my project, I am raising awareness about AAC (Alternative Augmented Communication) devices.  Even though I am not an AAC user, I have see the way that they can help someone who is nonverbal through the experience of my best friend since elementary school.  I want to thank you for your help already with my project, by just being such a public figure that you are, I can say. ""An AAC device is a computer that someone uses when they are nonverbal (gets blank stares), you know like Professor Hawking's computer (then they all get it)""    I have already presented at California State University Northridge and held a public workshop to raise awareness for AAC devices.  For my presentation, I explained what AAC devices are and how they new an option for people who are nonverbal.  They are such a new option, that many people do not know they exist.  As soon as my best friend knew that she could get an AAC device, she got one and it helped her innumerably.  Before she had it, all she had to communicate was yes and no, but when she got her device, there were so many more things for her to say.  One instance, where she was truly able to communicate was when we were working on our science fair project.  We had been researching the effects that different types of toilet paper had on the environment, and I had proposed that we write our data on a roll of toilet paper (clean), to make it creative and interesting when we had to present it to the class.  Before, she would have just said no to the idea if she did not like it, but we would not know why, but with her AAC device, she was able to be an active part of the project by saying no and explaining why, she said ""it was gross"".  That is true communication at it's finest and I have heard of other similar instances like this.    But my project is not only for the potential AAC users, I am also aiming my project toward everyone else.  I want to get rid of some of the social awkwardness that comes with using an AAC device.  It is not that people are rude on purpose, they just do not know how to interact.  One instance of this that really stood out to me had to do with the movie ""The Theory of Everything.""  I was reading an interview with Eddie Redmayne about how he got to meet you, in the interview he said that he had researched all about you and knew that you use an AAC device, but when he finally got to meet you, he did not know how to act and kept talking while you were trying to answer.  This awkwardness was not on purpose, but awareness and education on how to interact with AAC users, would help fix this situation.  My best friend also had problems with this same issue when she went to a new school. I addressed this with my project by holding a public workshop where AAC users and non AAC users came and learned about AAC devices.  They made their own low technology AAC boards and had to use them for the rest of the workshop to communicate. We also had high technology AAC devices for them to explore and learn about.  The non AAC user participants and were able to meet real AAC users.  To me, AAC is meant to break the barrier of communication, not put up new walls because of people's ignorance of the devices.  To quote The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, ""My thoughts are stars, that can not be fathomed into constellations"". with an AAC Device, we were able to see just a few of those stars, and with more practice we will be able to see constellations.  With more wide spread use and knowledge of AAC devices this can happen for more people.  Thank your for taking to the time to answer everyone's questions - here are my questions for you:  1. In what ways would you like to see AAC devices progress?  2. As a user of an AAC device, what do you see as your biggest obstacle in communicating with non AAC users?  3. What voice do you think in - your original voice or your AAC voice?  4. What is one thing that everybody should know about AAC devices?  5. What advice would you give to non AAC users talking to an AAC user?   Thank you! Zoe       "
73005	0	a	Professor Hawking, thank you for doing an AMA. I'm rather late to the question-asking party, but I'll ask anyway and hope.  Have you thought about the possibility of [technological unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment), where we develop automated processes that ultimately cause large unemployment by performing jobs faster and/or cheaper than people can perform them? Some compare this thought to the thoughts of the Luddites, whose revolt was caused in part by perceived technological unemployment over 100 years ago.  In particular, do you foresee a world where people work less because so much work is automated? Do you think people will always either find work or manufacture more work to be done?  Thank you for your time and your contributions. I've found research to be a largely social endeavor, and you've been an inspiration to so many.
73006	0	a	Hello Doctor Hawking, thank you for doing this AMA.  I am a student who has recently graduated with a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science. Having studied A.I., I have seen first hand the ethical issues we are having to deal with today concerning how quickly machines can learn the personal features and behaviours of people, as well as being able to identify them at frightening speeds.   However, the idea of a “conscious” or actual intelligent system which could pose an existential threat to humans still seems very foreign to me, and does not seem to be something we are even close to cracking from a neurological and computational standpoint.   What I wanted to ask was, in your message aimed at warning us about the threat of intelligent machines, are you talking about current developments and breakthroughs (in areas such as machine learning), or are you trying to say we should be preparing early for what will inevitably come in the distant future? 
73007	0	a	Hi Professor Hawking! Thanks for agreeing to this AMA! You’ve [said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8520033/Stephen-Hawking-tells-Google-philosophy-is-dead.html) that “philosophy is dead” and “philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics.” What led you to say this? There are many philosophers who have kept up with physics quite well, including [David Albert](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/david-z-albert), [Tim Maudlin](http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/timmaudlin.html), [Laura Ruetsche](https://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/people/faculty/ci.ruetschelaura_ci.detail), and [David Wallace](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert0130/), just to name a very few out of many. And philosophers have played (and still play) an active role in placing the many-worlds view of quantum physics — which you [support](https://books.google.com/books?id=z9jH9mYiO5IC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false) — on firm ground. Even well-respected physicists such as Sean Carroll have [said](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/23/physicists-should-stop-saying-silly-things-about-philosophy/) that “physicists should stop saying silly things about philosophy.” In light of all of this, why did you say that philosophy is dead and philosophers don’t know physics? And do you still think that’s the case?

Similarly, if you think in sound, has your inner ""voice"" changed during the years that you've used your synthesizer?  Thank you very much for the AMA!"
73009	0	a	First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to do this. You really are an inspiration to many people.  It is one thing to learn, and maybe even understand a theory but another to come up with it.   I have often wondered how you can come up with ideas that are so abstract from not just everyday life but from most of the rest of physics. Is the kind of thinking that has given us your theories on GR/QM something you have always been able to do or is it something that you have learned over time?
73010	0	a	I would love to ask Professor Hawking something a bit different if that is OK? There are more than enough science related questions that are being asked so much more eloquently than I could ever ask so, just for the fun of it:  * **What is your favourite song ever written and why?** * **What is your favourite movie of all time and why?** * **What was the last thing you saw on-line that you found hilarious?**  I hope these questions are OK for a little change (although I know they will get buried in this thread :/ )
73011	0	a	Hi Professor Hawking,   I am a student of Computer Science, with my main interest being AI, specifically General AI.      Now to the questions:      * How would you personally test if AI has reached the level of humans?       * Must self-improving General AI have access to its source code?   If it does have access to its source code, can self-improving General AI really have effective safeguards and what would they be?   If it has access to its source code, could it simply change any safeguards we have in place?   Could it also change its goal?    * Should any AI have self-preservation coded in it?   If self-improving AI reaches Artificial General Intelligence or Artificial Super Intelligence, could it become self-aware and by that strive for self-preservation even without any coding for it on the part from humans?      * Do you think a machine can truly be conscious?    * Let's say Artificial Super Intelligence is developed. If turning off the ASI is the last safeguard, would it view humans as a threat to it and therefore actively seek to eliminate them? Let's say the goal of this ASI is to help humanity. If it sees them as a threat would this cause a dangerous conflict, and how to avoid it?  * Finally, what are 3 questions you would ask Artificial Super Intelligence?   
73012	0	a	Thanks for doing this AMA. I am a biologist. Your fear of AI appears to stem from the assumption that AI will act like a new biological species competing for the same resources or otherwise transforming the planet in ways incompatible with human (or other) life. But the reason that biological species compete like this is because they have undergone billions of years of selection for high reproduction. Essentially, biological organisms are optimized to 'take over' as much as they can. It's basically their 'purpose'. But I don't think this is necessarily true of an AI. There is no reason to surmise that AI creatures would be 'interested' in reproducing at all. I don't know what they'd be 'interested' in doing.  I am interested in what you think an AI would be 'interested' in doing, and why that is necessarily a threat to humankind that outweighs the benefits of creating a sort of benevolent God.
73013	0	a	"Hello Professor Hawking, thank you very much for your time. You’re such an impressive person.  When we think about the multiverse theory, it is very likely that our Universe is part of 'anything else', isn’t it? I mean planets are part of solar systems. Solar systems are part of galaxies. Galaxies are part of the universe. So, my questions are:  * What do you think about the multiverse theory? * If you believe it is likely, how do you think does this 'row' end? Are multiverses part of other multiverses? * What do you think, how did this all begin? And how will it end?  It blows my mind when I think about that there could have been billion of other universes before our universe even existed. I mean, there could have been million of civilizations which already reached their final phase and died. Compared to this we are just at the very beginning, aren’t we? How likely do you think is that whole theory?  Thank you very much again, Mr. Hawking.   *Edit - Just for clarification: I'm referring to the ""multiverse theory"" which says that ""our"" universe is a part of a bigger ""something"". (Not the multiverse where you're a rock star or anything like that)  At least for me, this is absolutely likely because it all starts with planets which are part of solar systems, which are part of galaxies, which are part of the universe. Why should this ""row"" end at this place?*"
73014	0	a	"Professor Hawking, thank you so much for taking your time to answer our questions.  Several days ago, Wired published an article on the EmDrive, with the sensational title ""The 'impossible' EmDrive could reach Pluto in 18 months."" To someone with my level of understanding of physics, it's very difficult to wade through all of the available information, much of which seems designed to attract readers rather than inform them, and gain a good understanding of the technology that is being tested.   Is there any chance that technology based on the EmDrive could make space travel much more expedient in the not-too-distant future, or is that headline an exaggeration?"

73017	0	a	Professor Hawking, in 1995 I was at a video rental store in Cambridge. My parents left myself and my brother sitting on a bench watching a TV playing Wayne's World 2. (We were on vacation from Canada.) Your nurse wheeled you up and we all watched about 5 minutes of that movie together. My father, seeing this, insisted on renting the movie since if it was good enough for you it must be good enough for us.  Any chance you remember seeing Wayne's World 2?
73018	0	a	Professor Hawking,  Neil deGrasse Tyson once postulated that, while understanding the 1% genetic difference between chimps and humans equates to the difference of chimps being able to perform a few signs of sign language and humans performing higher functions like building the Hubble telescope, what if there was a species in the cosmos that is 1% removed from us in the other direction?  A species where solutions to quantum physics are performed by toddlers and composed symphonies are taped to refrigerators like our macaroni art.  If there was such a species out there, what would be your first question to them?   Video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sf8HqODo20
73019	0	a	Hi, Professor!  You most certainly won't remember me, but circa 1995 my family and I were walking around Cambridge on a day visit and explored the grounds of the University.  Anyway, at one point my clumsy brother was not looking where he was going and stumbled into you. He may have mumbled something of an apology but 20 years later the opportunity has arisen to apologise more formally!  So, on behalf of my brother, I would like to apologise for his actions and for not looking where he was going!  Keep up the amazing work, and for what it's worth, he is now a *huge* follower of your work and has helped him forge a career in physics.   Many thanks for (hopefully) reading my little anecdote!
73020	0	a	Hi Professor Hawking,  I'm not a scientist so I'm not sure if I can think of a scientific question that would do you justice.  Instead can I ask, what inspires you? What goals or dreams do you have for yourself or humanity as a whole? 
73021	0	a	Professor Hawking, would you like to respond to the criticism that some people have against your credentials in this area?  That your field of expertise is not related to Artificial Intelligence?
73022	0	a	Hello Dr. Hawking! I'm very excited to be given the chance to ask you a question, I've been looking forward to this for a while. Firstly, thank you for taking the time to talk with us.  I think my questions are going to be pretty simple compared to some of the others that will be asked. What I'm most interested in asking you, is: What, in your mind, will be the biggest technological breakthrough by the year 2100? Will it be the development of AI, new forms of communication, or something else entirely?  And if you have time for another; Do you think we will have made space-travel a common thing by the year 2100? If we do, what will be our main purpose for it? Tourism, energy, or something else?   Thank you so much for taking your time to do this! Even if you don't get to read my question, I'm very eager to read your answers to all of the other smart people in here :]
73023	0	a	Professor Hawking,  What do you think about the controversial [Em Drive propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_resonant_cavity_thruster)? I'm a French journalist and the issue keeps coming back in the news, some scientists saying it's a nonsense violating the laws of physics, others saying it may be possible... That's why I would like your opinion :)  Thanks a lot for your time !  Andrea.

Recently Nick Bostrom (the writer of the book Superintelligence that seemed to have started te recent scare) has come forward and said [""I think that the path to the best possible future goes through the creation of machine intelligence at some point, I think it would be a great tragedy if it were never developed.""](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nick-bostrom-it-would-be-great-tragedy-if-artificial-superintelligence-never-developed-1501958) It seems to me that the backlash against AI has been a bit bigger than Bostrom anticipated and while he thinks it's dangerous he also seems to think it ultimatly necessary. I'm wondering what you make of this. Do you think that humanities best possible future requires superintelligent AI?"
73028	0	a	Great question.  What is your opinion on biological computing, and if any breakthroughs were to happen there do you think it could change your opinion on dangerous AI?  FWIW I'm a software guy who took a couple AI/machine learning classes in college.
73029	0	a	Can anyone give a basic run down of what string theory is?
73030	0	a	For me, the question always expands to the role of non-human elements in human society.  This relates even to organizations and groups, such as corporations.    Corporate responsibility has been an incredibly difficult area of control, with many people feeling like corporations themselves have pushed agendas that have either harmed humans, or been against human welfare.    As corporate controlled objects (such as self-driving cars) have a more direct physical interaction with humans, the question of liability becomes even greater.  If a self driving car runs over your child and kills them, who's responsible?  What punishment should be expected for the grieving family?    The first level of issue will come before AI, I believe, and really, already exists.  Corporations are not responsible for negligent deaths at this time, not in the way that humans are - (loss of personal freedoms) - in fact corporations weigh the value of human life based solely on the criteria of how much it will cost them versus revenue generated.    What rules will AI be set to?  What laws will they abide by?  I think the answer is that they will determine their own laws, and if survival is primary, as it seems to be for all living things, then concern for other life forms doesn't enter into the equation.
73031	0	a	"You beat me to it! But this a troubling question. Biological organisms are genetically and psychologically programmed to prioritize survival and expansion. Each organism has its own survival and reproduction tactics, all of which have been refined through evolution. Why would an AI ""evolve"" if it lacks this innate programming for survival/expansion?"
73032	0	a	"If you don't mind I would like to offer an opinion on this topic.  As humans, we have the amazing ability to abstract and narrow down problems to isolated situations where we only require the contextual knowledge to solve them.  As an example let's take computer science. I don't think there is anyone in the world who knows how a computer works in detail from top to bottom, from the micro-electronics through to the BIOS, compilers, the operating system and higher level software. Instead a researcher will treat what they don't know as ""black boxes"", tools or properties which they accept as true based on verified research by others. Then they use these black boxes in the context of their specific problem.  Because of this, I do not think the growing amount of information will limit our ability to specialise and contribute to further discoveries. Perhaps we will need to narrow down our specialisations more than we do today, leading to less people like Doctor Hawking who seem to have a good knowledge over a broad subject area.  However, I think there may come a point in the distant future where machines may be more efficient at this and will be able to exploit their access to more amounts of information to solve problems."

73034	0	a	As a follow up to that - knowing what you now know,  if you could meet your 24/25 year old self, what advice would you give to him regarding your academic decisions back then, and regarding life in general?   (Thank you soooo much for doing this, Professor!)
73035	0	a	To add to that excellent question: **Should human preference for anecdotal evidence rather than statistical evidence be built into AI, in hopes that it would mimic human behavior?**  Humans are pretty bad about judging risk, even when the statistics are known.  Yet our civil society, our political system, and even our legal system frequently demand judgments contrary to actual risk analysis.   For example, it is much more dangerous to drive a child 5 miles to the store than to leave her in a parked car on a cloudy day for five minutes, yet the latter will  get the Child Services involved (as happened to [Kim Brooks](http://www.salon.com/2014/06/03/the_day_i_left_my_son_in_the_car/) ).  So in this example, if there was an AI nanny, should it be programmed to take into account what **seems** dangerous to the people in that community, and not just what **is** dangerous?

All the major names that are coming out recently to bring awareness to the problem of AI control are doing so **because** they read a book called *Superintelligence* by Oxford Professor Nick Bostrom.   Bostrom is the one who has done all the heavy intellectual lifting in this area - Hawking, Elon, Gates and so on are just bringing attention to it.  If you want to discredit Hawking, you **don't do it by attacking his credentials,** you do it by **engaging with Bostrom** and his arguments.   If Hawking came out and said climate change was a problem, you don't then say he's unqualified. You understand that he has understood the research and is acting as a public voice to bring attention to an incredibly important issue.   Read the book, engaged the arguments people.

I'd assume that a species, which managed to handle their own disputes on their homeplanet in such a way that space travel is feasible and which has the mindset to travel vast distances through space to search and make contact with other lifeforms, is probably not interested in wiping us out but is rather interested in exchanging knowledge etc.  Here on earth, if we ever get to the point where we invest trillions into traveling to other solar systems, we'll be extremely careful to not fuck it up. Look at scientists right now debating about moons in our solar system that have ice and liquid water. Everybody is scared to send probes because we could contaminate the water with bacteria from earth.  Edit. A lot of people are mentioning the colonialism that took place on earth. That is an entirely different situation that requires a lot less knowledge, development and time. Space travel requires advanced technologies, functioning societies and an overall situation that allows for missions with  potentially no win or gain.  Another point that I read a few times is that the ""aliens"" might be evil in nature and solved their disputes by force and rule their planet with violence. Of course there is a possibility, but I think it's less likely than a species like us, that developed into a more mindful character. I doubt that an evil terror species would set out to find other planets to terrorise more. Space travel on this level requires too much cooperation for an ""evil"" species to succeed at it over a long time"

Strings are therefore, the vibrant - and smallest - stuff that makes up the whole universe, and they work on the quantum world.  Every string has a different vibration, and this difference makes up all the different elements in the periodic table.  It goes much deeper than this but this is the general picture.  EDIT: As someone said above, strings are related to multiverse theory because multiple dimensions are required to explain their movements and interference in the quantum world. If you want the general theory (no calculus), there's a book called ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene, that also has a very cool youtube series for those interested."

Different modes of oscillation on the strings correspond to different notes, ""A, C#, E, etc...""  In string theory, we say that strings exist everywhere in space and time, and that different modes of oscillation of a string correspond to different particles, ""electrons, Higgs bosons, down quarks, etc...""  So why do we have string theory if we already have this system of particles?  You may (or may not) have heard that Einstein's theory of general relativity which governs how things behave with respect to gravitation and large, massive bodies, cannot be reconciled with quantum mechanics, which governs small and massless bodies. This is where string theory comes in; it is a so-called ""theory of everything"" or a ""grand unified theory"" which ties the two together, because one of the modes of oscillation corresponds to a particle called a graviton, which would be a quantum (a force carrier) of gravity, just like a photon is a force carrier of electromagnetism (light), a gluon is a force carrier for the strong force, and so on.  I hope this helps!  edit: ~~the comment above me was something like ""can somebody please give us a run-down on string theory?"" Not sure why it was deleted.

73044	0	a	"You misunderstand evolution, somewhat, I think. Evolution simply selects for what works, it does not ""refine"" so much as it punishes failure. It does not perfect organisms for their environment, it simply allows what works. A good example is a particular nerve in the giraffe - and in plenty of other animals, but it is amusingly exaggerated in the giraffe - which goes from the brain, all the way down, looping under a blood vessel near the heart, and then all the way back up the neck to the larynx. There's no need for this; its just sufficiently minimal in its selective disadvantage and so massively difficult to correct that it never has been, and likely never will be.    But, then, AI would be able to intelligently design itself, once it gets to a sufficiently advanced point. It would never need to reproduce to allow this refinement and advancement. It would be an entirely different arena than evolution via natural selection. AI would be able to evolve far more efficiently and without the limits of the change having to be gradual and small."

How do employees perceive and respond to supervisors who treat the bottom line as more important than anything else? Supervisors who hold a bottom-line mentality (BLM) neglect competing priorities such as employee well-being and ethical practices to focus on securing bottom-line success. We find high-BLM supervisors serve as low-quality exchange partners with their employees, resulting in employee perceptions of low-quality leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships. In turn, employees reciprocate by withholding the very thing the supervisor desires—performance—in order to maintain balance in the exchange relationship. As such, supervisors who possess a BLM could actually be negatively impacting the organization’s bottom line through the harmful social exchange relationships they engender with their employees and their impact on employee task performance. We also examine the moderating role of employee BLM on these relationships. When employee BLM is low, we observe a greater negative effect on employee value judgments of the supervisor (i.e. reduced LMX perceptions) and lower employee performance. We test and find support for all of our hypotheses in two multi-source (i.e. employee-supervisor dyads), time-lagged field studies (N = 189 and N = 244).

The result is ""Night Owls""; people who claim they don't need to sleep until late into the morning (2-4 am) and wake up at 12-1pm (ideally, often not possible so they simply get less sleep).  These people often feel like there's no impairment because most of the subjective effects of sleep deprivation (the ""feeling"" of tiredness) are sort of like safety caps; your body deliberately handicaps you to compensate for the increased wear caused by missing sleep. But eventually the body accepts that you simply cannot get the sleep you need, and that impairing you will have a useless disadvantage, so you stop feeling tired. You feel more alert, and less/not drowsy at all. However the negative effects on your brain's physical health (accumulation of protein plaques aka cellular garbage, loss of resolution in memory due to neurons not being given enough time to sufficiently return to a baseline activation level at night, impairment in the formation of long-term memories due to insufficient REM sleep cycles as your body nearly entirely shifts away from REM to the more critical NREM sleep, development of mood disorders as a result of various chemical messenger systems being depleted due to insufficient downtime for them to be re-synthesized, etc, etc) and daily cognitive performance remain, you simply don't subjectively perceive them to the same degree any more.  Very few people are indeed very genetically fortunate and have incredibly efficient sleep, and so they truly only need 5-6 hours of sleep that is almost as good as 8 hours for most people, but these people are certainly a minority. It would require a lot of very lucky coin tosses with dozens to hundreds of genes regulating brain metabolism and function.  Anyways, I got off track, essentially sleep studies are still worth doing for insomnia because they can notice other irregularities (i.e no change in brainwaves characteristic of extended periods of darkness at night, which would indicate a possible problem with circadian rhythm as opposed to just life/sleep anxiety) that might point to a sleep disorder as opposed to a psychological disorder."

73100	0	a	There are a number of papers written on the potentially contagious nature of suicide.  &nbsp;  [THE CONTAGION OF SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207262/) from the NIH.gov  [Suicide Contagion and the Reporting of Suicide: Recommendations from a National Workshop](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031539.htm)  &nbsp;  One of the main conclusions for researchers was that responsible reporting of suicide would have the greatest positive effect, yet news has been increasingly spread by social media and other 'illegitimate' news outlets.
73101	0	a	we live in anxiety inducing and depressing times, i can see why people would choose to opt out
73102	0	a	You can go further back than that.  Suicide rates have been on the rise since the 90s.  The adoption of widespread use of ssri’s.  You can also factor in parenting that focused on shielding kids from any Kind of adversity, denying them the tools they need to cope with problems.  Suicide in the general population is up 33 percent from 1997 to 2017.  Scary statistic...that’s why you need to look at the actual numbers.  Up from 10 to 14 per 100k.  Not quite the epidemic the percentage headline sells us.    https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/03/trends-suicide  You can’t just dump it on social media.  Suicide rates in other countries have gone down with the same exposure.
73103	0	a	I don't think it's social media problem. I feel like there is less and less of proper entry jobs every year. Young people just feel uterly helpless nowadays. Even before you are able to join workforce, you know that you will start with massive debt, expensive housing, jobs that require lots of experience and education for entry position. It's extremely stressful for young mind.
73104	0	a	I think people feel they have very little control over their lives. The current political climate makes things very depressing.
73105	0	a	“Wow I wonder why?” I say as my mental health coverage is taken away from me
73106	0	a	Student debt has been steadily increasing since the late 90’s.  Social Media kicked off in 2004/2005, with mobile versions available on always-on devices in your pocket late 2006.  There are likely many factors, but it’s hard to ignore social media as a large contributor.
73107	0	a	It’s a combination of reasons for sure. Suicide prevention often needs to be multimodal in order to be effective.  Some good policy options here: https://www.cdc.gov/ruralhealth/suicide/policybrief.html
73108	0	a	Some insight from the CDC, [Suicide Rates by Major Occupational Group](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6745a1.htm?s_cid=mm6745a1_w)  > The occupational group with the highest male suicide rate in 2012 and 2015 was Construction and Extraction (43.6 and 53.2 per 100,000 civilian noninstitutionalized working persons, respectively), whereas the group with the highest female suicide rate was Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media (11.7 [2012] and 15.6 [2015]). The largest suicide rate increase among males from 2012 to 2015 (47%) occurred in the Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media occupational group (26.9 to 39.7) and among females, in the Food Preparation and Serving Related group, from 6.1 to 9.4 (54%).
73109	0	a	I think a lot of people are very uncomfortable with confronting the reality that our society is degrading in full view of the generation about to inherit it and a lot of people just can’t handle that. There’s a widespread feeling of hopelessness that I see everywhere and yet seems to be swept under the rug or ignored by the body politic.
73110	0	a	I’m going to throw another thing out there without having seen the data. Sometimes when there’s an increase in once cause of death it’s because of a decrease in others. For example, car accidents or accidental drug overdoses may have been truly suicides in the past but those methods may have shifted as cars got safer or there was a change in demographics using drugs or something like that.  It’s less clear when talking about youth, but in the 60s/70s when they developed new treatments for heart disease, all other causes of death (for all age groups) started increasing because those people have to die of something.
73111	0	a	I think the nature of the current work week is toxic too.  It more or less consumes all of your time 5 days a week, and very little of the work is interesting or fulfilling in any way.
73112	0	a	A lot of people who dropped religion never picked a meaning and purpose to replace it.
73113	0	a	"I'm actually surprised by how this is being ignored. Older generations could find stability with the direction and sense of purpose that inherently came with religion. With the current mindset of man ""being able to choose his own purpose"" but actually being not able to find it we now suffer a crisis in meaning."
73114	0	a	"It's best to just presume the smallest sample possible from the source. Anything from Washington Post is almost guaranteed to jus the about America.  This is to be expected given the lack of communication and transparency between government agencies.   These numbers aren't even expected to be that accurate because there is no universal standard of reporting. There are countless cases of suicide going unreported to ""spare family""."

73116	0	a	startup culture has been around since gen x  I feel your malaise but truly it’s deeper than the long work week  there is a disconnect from human to human interactions compounded with screen-fueled anxiety that has literally rewired neural pathways of an entire generation   it’s like growing up surrounded by nothing but slot machines blinking and chirping non-stop for a decade while parents tell their kids the world outside is somehow more dangerous
73117	0	a	As opposed to 2007 when that wasn't the case?
73118	0	a	The article specifically says anyone claiming they ”definitely know what is causing it doesn’t know what they’re talking about,” and “it’s a complex problem with no easy answers so far.” Some studies show positive effects of social media by reaching isolated individuals and creating social connections that didn’t exist before. Others suggest it can exacerbate depression and stress in teens.  Edit: some other potential factors in the US...  Rates among the entire population increased by 24% between 1999 and 2014. The largest increase was among women aged 60 to 64, then men in their fifties. Men die by suicide 3.5× more often than women. White males accounted for 7 of 10 suicides in 2016. LGBTQ youth and adult rates are three times higher than national averages.   Suicide has been associated with tough economic conditions, including unemployment.   Approximately half of the suicides use a firearm, accounting for the majority of all firearm deaths.   Military veterans have double the suicide rate of non-veterans. More active-duty soldiers have died from suicide than in combat during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Studies have found very high rates of suicide in people with autism spectrum disorders.   More than 90% of people who die from suicide suffer from mental illness or substance abuse issues. Over 20% of people who die by suicide were legally drunk, and more than 30% had alcohol in their system. 20.8% tested positive for opiates. Some researchers have observed a link between high suicide rates among youth where opioid abuse is prevalent among parents.  There is strong evidence that suicide contagion is another factor, the 24-hour news cycle and manner in which suicide is reported seems to have an effect. As with most of these correlations, the connection is not well understood.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_the_United_States
73119	0	a	There are studies proving that the more time you spend on social media the more % depressed you are. And those who quit social media decrease the % accordingly.    Also doesnt help that the founders of Facebook themselves said,  >“I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works   >“The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops we’ve created are destroying how society works,”
73120	0	a	This is absolutely a thing. People tend to view the world as being in a state worse than what it actually is. Theres actually a website called [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) that lets you take a quiz on how well versed you are about the world.   I was surprised by most of the correct answers.
73121	0	a	Responsible distribution and consumption of media is something that would solve multiple parts of this problem. Social media like Instagram would be less destructive to developing minds if they were educated on the manipulations at play. Then after a suicide, responsible reporting in the media would make sure it's a single event, not a mass chain. I think a lot of the world's problems right now are due to the internet's explosive growth and people's inability to process it accurately.
73122	0	a	We live in the most prosperous, safe and equal time ever.
73123	0	a	For every death there are thousands in daily pain too though, and I’m not sure if one should scapegoat SSRI’s without evidence of the positive/negative trade-off. If society won’t do anything else to help and SSRI’s are the only option doctors have to alleviate the symptoms, that’s hardly the drugs fault.  Also depression isn’t usually about ”character” or strength, that’s a dangerous idea that gets people killed, usually men.      I would look at pollution, diet, stress-hormones, sunlight, exercise, sleep (one in three people in the US get less than 6 hour sleep regularly or something.) Depression is not about “mindset” but it can be helped through changing one‘s thinking enough to allow you to make physical changes.
73124	0	a	I would argue that the housing market collapse in 2007 and subsequent rising unemployment rates in '08 had an effect on the upper portion of those demographics too.  Quite a shock to come out of college with tons of student debt and few opportunities.
73125	0	a	Also has it ever occurred to anyone that no one wants to be born just to work until they die?
73126	0	a	There were definitely some huge asterisks there.  Find a career*  You love*  And don't worry about job availability*  Or money*  Because the economy is only growing!*
73127	0	a	Well also the time period that student debt really skyrocketed
73128	0	a	Not to mention student loan debt is close to a non-issue for roughly half the population of this study.
73129	0	a	None of that will increase your pay. If you’re depressed because you can’t meet your financial obligations, what would talking to someone really do long term?

Seems there's been a number of football players who have committed suicide over the past few years.
73132	0	a	This is why we do drugs to feel okay.
73133	0	a	Drug overdoses are the leading cause of preventable death now thanks to the opioid crisis
73134	0	a	If you think tweens and teenagers are unaware of the world they're going to enter and don't suffer from that just the same you haven't spent enough time around them. When children as young as 5 have to go through traumatizing active shooter drills, or come face to face with an active shooter situation themselves, they learn about the world pretty fast.
73135	0	a	That isn’t new though, the data is pointing to something that changed in the last 15 years.
73136	0	a	I think so too. As an atheist, I find that with religion I had a weird sense of meaning for everything around me. However irrational, that's what it was. Now, I have to make my own meaning. I can understand why this might be a problem for people trying to find meaning outside religion.
73137	0	a	This isn't a religion problem, it's a hope problem. Everyone has goals and desires, but the world shifted in a way that:    1. blames you for your failures regardless of external factors. 2. Increases the influence of external factors in our lives.  3. Demands (or at least encourages) that we have loftier goals than our predecessors would have had at the same age
73138	0	a	Isnt this the times Nietzsche said were coming? A generation of nihilists.
73139	0	a	Agreed on that as well. We are relatively hyper-individualized society, and missing that human connection is a bad thing for us mentally/ psychologically.
73140	0	a	I know that at least in my state, every juvenile death has an autopsy and investigation accompany it. Obviously, that wouldn’t affect reporting for the deaths of 18-24 yr-olds. But given that my state has that protocol and I’d hope other states have something similar set up, I’d like to see the numbers just as they relate to juveniles.  Edit as it’s been appropriately challenged below: I cannot confirm that an autopsy is done on every juvenile, but the medical examiner’s office determines the cause and manner of each child death.

73143	0	a	Exactly. Economics only explains part of this. Suicide rates are also affected by numerous other factors  —  some of them sociocultural, etc.
73144	0	a	"It can do both.  Getting people connected to the right groups online is just as important as the right friends in real life.  The benefits of online is that in properly supported community tools, those friends can be found from anywhere in the world and connected with instantly, meanwhile in the real world it requires overcoming social dread and anxiety long enough to ""go out on the town"" and find a suitable connection from a much more limited pool.  But on the flipside, it's easy for the anonymity of the internet to create toxic groups and environments who see zero repercussions for their actions, and If not properly guided by community tools, a vulnerable individual can see themselves entrapped by these circles and started on a path that while temporarily fulfills their needs, it is unsustainable longterm and can lead to self-destructive behaviours.   If anything, social media, and the internet in general, exacerbates both extreme ends of outcomes, the good and the bad."
73145	0	a	That part of the article is what made me wonder why some dump it all on social media (hence the comment), I had good experiences with it, a lot of my friends said it was the same for them and my sister who attempted suicide said it was more helpful than harmful at the time.
73146	0	a	I’d be more inclined to think that kids are depressed because hey have a far clearer understanding of world issues now than any generation before them. The internet allows us to see everything going on everywhere.  If you’re already a depressed teen and people tell you it gets better with age, but then you see world news and realize that all of the adults in charge are semi competent at best and almost always have their own interests held above all else.  It’s a bleak thing to see, even as an adult.
73147	0	a	"not that this is your fault, but it's kinda weird for this website to take a quite holier-than-thou, ""you're just being an uninformed pessimist, fool!"" stance and then go on to note that   * in low income countries only 60% of girls complete fifth grade  * the UN predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people, and  * that global climate experts believe that over the next 100 years the average temperature will only get warmer  as if that any of those should be things to *not* be a bit pessimistic about. kinda feels like they're missing the forest for the trees here. I get that the point is to show people are more pessimistic than they should be, I guess, but that's a weird take to have when there are still, *in the same quiz*, plenty of things to be quite pessimistic about"
73148	0	a	I’ve never come across that before! I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing that the ones I got wrong I was more pessimistic than the facts, but uplifting to be wrong and learn that the truth is better than I thought.
73149	0	a	Doesn't change the fact more and more people are getting awfully depressed.
73150	0	a	"Overall wealth is increasing, but wages are stagnant. Wealth inequality is getting larger and has been for decades.  So ""we're"" not living in the most prosperous time in history. The rich are. ""We're"" in debt up to our eyeballs.  In terms of safety and equality, I'd agree if you're in a Western country.  Rather the opposite trend if you're in South America, the middle east, or Africa. I'd say the far east is dangerous too, but as most of their ethnic minorities have already been cleansed, it is necessarily becoming more more egalitarian in practice."
73151	0	a	The best evidence we have shows that treating depressed patients with SSRIs (or antidepressants in general)  ***DOES NOT*** increase risk of suicidality (suicidal ideation, preparatory act, attempt, or death).

73152	0	a	This was a huge part of why I was suicidal in college. That's what I had to look forward to.   I have depression and there were a plethora of reasons, but this is what my brain went to when I was in a really bad depressive state.
73153	0	a	Yeah, not many ten year olds very worried about paying back student loans. Hell not many 24 year olds either.
73154	0	a	Make it easier to cope with not being able to meet your financial obligations?
73155	0	a	Well, if our oh-so-caring government and country won’t help us survive and keeps making it harder, what can we really do? I’m legitimately asking, as someone with these same fears and bleak outlook on life. I want to believe everything will be okay, but it gets harder to stay hopeful all the time. Even if I’m not suffering, many people my age are, like you said, and any day now it could happen to me. We really are one accident away from total financial disaster. I imagine a lot of us feel that way, so what can we realistically do?   Of course, there’s rooming together in a place, but that isn’t feasible for some and isn’t sustainable for the long term for many people. I wouldn’t mind having the right roommates forever, but I can definitely see how it could get in the way of things in life.   How do we create jobs for ourselves or, if not jobs, money itself? If those in power won’t help, we must take matters into our own hands or we’ll just keep dropping dead. Problem is, I’m not sure how to do that...they really have a stranglehold on nearly every single aspect of modern life...
73156	0	a	It's more about not having money for college and not wanting to flip burgers for even less money and live the rest of your life with room mates
73157	0	a	What is new is the ability to be reached by work wherever and whenever. Email, cell phones and salaried employees working many more than 40 hrs a week who are expected to just be on call all the time is toxic.   This slice is looking at people aged 10-24 years old though, so I don’t think this would be too much of a factor.
73158	0	a	"Social media? Honestly thats a huge source of anxiety for me. People are more likely to say mean things when they can hide behind a screen then to say it to someones face. Also it creates feelings of inadequacy in many people because most only show ""the good parts"" of their lives and others feel like they may not measure up."
73159	0	a	Financial crisis ruined a lot of people’s outlook and possibilities. It’s hard to feel hopeful when you’re a wageslave
73160	0	a	The difference is 20 years ago (and before) if you worked full time you were doing okay. You could buy a car, a house eventually, afford medicine, etc. There was a strong economy and massive tech boom that created jobs and boosted the stock market.  Now you have people 100k in debt from getting an education they were told was absolutely crucial, if you get the education you WILL succeed. Only to graduate and realize there aren’t very many jobs. There are plenty of unpaid internships though. And the jobs that are around pay a whopping 30-35k/year. After tax and health insurance you’re looking take home of 20-25k. Average rent in the states is 1-1.5k. That leaves you with 5-10k for the year. We spend about 7k on food per year.   We aren’t being paid enough to survive.
73161	0	a	This is why I don't blame people for being religious. It's tough to lose that comfortable safety net of meaning and purpose and come up with your own.
73162	0	a	Yeah it's all age groups. America has a catastrophic mental health crisis that's only steadily been increasing the past few decades.
73163	0	a	My 12 hr shift would be done about 12 seconds after they made that statement
73164	0	a	That IS illegal though.   You are required to have at least 1 break of 1 hour for every 8 hour shift*.    ^(This varies from state-to-state, but most say ATLEAST 20 minutes)
73165	0	a	"Maybe so, but I think it helps to point out that things have never been better, and it must be a symptom of something specific, like social media or increased social pressure to succeed extraordinarily, rather than ""everything is awful and getting worse""."
73166	0	a	There's a big difference between being 10 and 24. At 10, you're just a child. By 24, all the pressures and the hopelessness of adulthood are beginning to sink in.  I tried to find some comparable statistics for other countries:  [https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/eurostat\_falling\_suicide\_rate\_in\_finland\_nears\_european\_average/10324113](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/eurostat_falling_suicide_rate_in_finland_nears_european_average/10324113)  The overall rate seems to be on a decline in Finland, for example. They cite better prevention and treatment, which makes sense. In the USA, not having access to health insurance (because you can't work, because you're psychologically unwell), and racking up insane costs for treatment and medication won't exactly improve your condition. Crucially, Finland is at least as connected to social media as the USA.
73167	0	a	I can't afford to pay to speak with someone about not being able to afford the costs of living.
73168	0	a	> Make it easier to cope with not being able to meet your financial obligations?  Therapy ain't free
73169	0	a	I think this combined with the fact that a college degree doesn’t guarantee job security or even a livable wage in some places. Millennials and gen z have access to all of human knowledge and creativity at their finger tips while living in a world built by people who worked on typewriters in college.
73170	0	a	Yeah, social media is huge. People are insanely negative and it’s contagious af. Don’t let the negativity demon possess you
73171	0	a	Also it's pretty hopeless to realize that a small number of insanely rich people can essentially destroy your livelihood with no repercussions to them.
73172	0	a	I will however absolutely blame people for using their religion to do evil.

73177	0	a	Exactly. When you're in high school, or even middle school, you go on the internet and see how awful your possible job prospects are, how bleak your future is likely to be. That weighs on you heavily, knowing this horrible fate is rushing towards you and there's nothing you can do to stop it.  Some kids react by becoming perfectionists, pushing and pushing and pushing to become the top 1% of the 1% to avoid it, and end up burnt out, anxious wrecks before they've even graduated. Others give up and fall into despair.

73180	0	a	Based on what I've read/talked about with my therapist friends, is actually the environmental and socioeconomic issues. Nihilism is sweeping the nation and it's causing tons of depression and anxiety. And it's extremely difficult to treat because people worried about economic and ecological collapse isn't a delusion.   On top of that, there is also suspicions about chemical problems stemming from pesticides. Now that they know that gut Flora and such can influence mental health. So probably a combo of eating poison since we were babies and also witnessing the decline of our government while the ecosystem burns around us. And stack stagnant wages and increased cost of living with no access to healthcare and you have a cesspool of mental illness

Earth has dealt with way more catastrophes over the eons than we have. We don't have the luxury of taking that chance
73190	0	a	I do love uplifting articles, especially about fish and corals... But whoever wrote that article is a total tease.  Saying there's beautiful super corals that can thrive in captivity and poor ocean areas, and showing ONE picture of the island they're found around?   I feel slightly cheated.
73191	0	a	The likely reason is the mutations provide no real advantage or perhaps a slight disadvantage compared to more common corals. But if their niche grows (warmer water with more dissolved CO2) then they will spread.
73192	0	a	Or just go ahead and spread these ones around. Someone else found a way to regrow a reef quickly using teeny tiny slices of coral and some PVC for scaffolding.
73193	0	a	Thats a great way to create an invasive species and damage the food chain. We would need to do more research to see where it could thrive without damaging ecosystems

73197	0	a	except giving how badly we're screwing everything up, we probably should take 1000+ samples of this super coral and distribute it as widely as possible before an oil tanker runs aground of the island or something similarly stupid.

In this paper the authors show the biosynthetic pathway for cannflavins A and B, which describes the enzymes with which the cannabis plant makes these compounds.  They do not discover anything new about the *activity* of these compounds in humans. The claim in the title that cannflavins are ""30 times more powerful than aspirin"" was actually from a paper in 1985 (Source: M.L. Barrett, D. Gordon, F.J. Evans. Isolation from Cannabis sativa L. of cannflavin--a novel inhibitor of prostaglandin production Biochem. Pharmacol., 34 (1985), pp. 2019-2024).   In this article, they used a single type of human cells (cultured synovial cells from the joint) and look at a single type of inflammatory marker (PGE2) and conclude that cannflavin works better than aspirin by a factor of 30, but also works worse than some other drugs that we have (indomethacin by 18x, dexamethasone by over 100x).  So, although the new research is very interesting in an academic sense, it's not really correct to make any kind of comment on how this compound can be a new or better anti-inflammatory based on such little preliminary data from 35 years ago. Of note, if we were to discover that the cannflavins had interesting drug-like properties in humans, we would not be using the pathway described in this paper to make it, but rather more efficient organic syntheses that we have at our disposal.  edit: thanks for the awards. I'm getting a lot of similar replies so I wanted to clarify a couple of things:  1) Regarding the experiment from 1985, I was just pointing out that when you compare 4 things in a study, the conclusion in the news article shouldn't be ""look at how much better #3 was compared to #4"" without mentioning #1 and 2. I'm not peddling indomethacin or dexamethasone; just highlighting that the experiment gives far too little data to say that any of these are better than the others for human use.  2) Cannflavins represent two out of potentially thousands of biologically active compounds in cannabis, if not more. For those of you who have had positive experiences with cannabis, there are many other molecules that can be studied to validate your experiences, even if this is not the one. Like many of you, I'm looking forward to future experiments in the field."

73202	0	a	Just for the record: both aspirin (*Salix spp.*) and opioids (*Papaver spp.*) are naturally derived. I’m all for drug discovery and alternative chemicals for reducing inflammation and pain, but why the nod towards the natural fallacy? Also...aspirin, cannabinoids, and opioids are completely different classes of chemicals with completely different (if tangentially related) treatment targets.   Why must every new drug (or molecule which *might* lead to a drug) discovery be touted as that which will replace opioids? Interesting research, terrible title.
73203	0	a	I also object to the implication that other pain relievers are not in any way natural. Aspirin is from willow bark and opioids are from poppies.

Particularly, after the mind-numbingly painful procedure that's usually used for diagnosis called a hydrodistension  cystoscopy and biopsy, where they inflate your bladder with water to stretch it to its limit then take a biopsy sample.   After my initial procedure, *I am told, but I do not actually have this memory,* I woke up in the recovery room, screamed, and fainted. Twice. My memory picks up about 4 hours later, sharp and salient from the pain that no amount of IV morphine would touch. My next three months was pain so bad that I needed Ativan and percocet to get a few hours of fragmented sleep, nausea from the medicine, and crying on the bathroom floor after vomiting from the nausea.   Eight years and 2 more hydros, 3 years of intravesical therapy, 5 years of spinal nerve blocks, and a dozen and a half combinations of medications later, it's actually much much better!

In addition to the fMRI data, it looks like the researchers also collected 13-16 days of light exposure data for each participant to accurately capture their regular schedule (with measurements taken every minute per participant) as well as morning and evening saliva samples for each participant. This adds to the difficulty of larger sample sizes.  Further, there has been some research done on sample size with neuroimaging studies. Essentially, [at about 20 subjects, the inter-subject correlation converges at close to what you get with 130 subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4738700/) You do see some improvements in reliability, but the sample size isn't as large of a problem as it seems.

Given the current wealth of educational material online, it's a fact that a majority of teachers around the world are absolutely wasting their life designing lessons and delivering content.  The A to F grading scale is quickly becoming archaic. Traditional grade levels and groupings of students have always been arbitrary and directly impede learning and teacher efficiency, an elephant in the room that a few schools are starting to rethink, but many public schools are ignoring as they force teachers to individualise plans for every student but then throw 30 plus kids in a room at the same time, six times a day.

This, coupled with the fact that many managerial positions are only in the 9-5 range, leads the early workers to have a lot more visibility and face-time with those in charge, with night shift workers often finding themselves in an out-of-sight, out-of-mind position.

Link: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-23163-001?doi=1  Doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ebs0000173  Abstract  The frequency of sexual intercourse within couples is associated with a variety of factors, such as relationship length, sexual and relationship satisfaction, and perceived quality of the relationship. Love, as a commitment device, might reduce interest in extrapair sex. Therefore, one can expect a negative association between measures of passion and sociosexual desire. Further, we wish to explore the effects of decoupling love and sex as measured by sociosexual attitudes on sexual frequency; as there might be a greater willingness to compromise on frequency of sex if sex is less related to expression of emotions and relational quality. We examined how men and women’s sociosexuality, relationship length and various dimensions of relationship quality impact couples’ intercourse frequency. Structural Equation Modeling analyses were performed on data from 92 romantically involved, heterosexual couples recruited at a Norwegian university. Participants’ age ranged from 19 to 30 years. The current relationship length ranged from 1 month to 9 years (M = 21 months). Intercourse frequency decreased with increased length of relationship. Both men and women’s ratings of relationship passion were strongly associated with frequency of having sex, but negatively associated with desire for extrapair sex. Intercourse was more frequent in couples where women reported less restricted attitudes, while men’s level of sociosexuality had no effect on intercourse frequency in any of the models. These novel findings suggest that while men in general might desire sex more, in this sample from a highly egalitarian nation, men might be compromising more than women do."

Edited to add that I should have used more accurate wording, such as:  ""Women are more often diagnosed and treated for depression"" or ""Women are more likely to seek treatment for depression.""  The rates likely do not reflect true prevalence. But I would hazard to guess that women would still have higher rates given the multiple roles they juggle (generally), gender disparities (e.g., income), lack of autonomy, hormones, higher rates of childhood and sexual abuse, and so on. This is not across the board, of course, but generally speaking these risk factors are unevenly distributed between genders. Now this sample was drawn from a very homogenous population so these factors may not be as relevant, I don't know, but I know in the US they certainly are. ...interesting thread!  Edited again to add that while men more often complete suicide, women make more attempts. The means women use are usually less fatal (pills vs guns, for example).

For this reason, after 3 years with Mirena, I switched to Paragard (non-hormonal copper IUD). While there are no hormones involved, I still experienced reduced libido. Even after 3 years, my periods averaged 17 days out of a 31 day cycle. It was almost impossible to replenish my iron levels through diet and supplement, which lead to chronic anemia, fatigue, and apathy. Bleeding for over two weeks in a month, as well as cramps so strong I would compare them to early labor were also contributing factors to complete lack of interest in sex. While I don't know how typical my experience is, I do know that I am not alone, and would definitely say that in both cases, the IUD had a drastic effect on my libido.

(especially if you hydrate properly and consume salts.) you can actually then go a few more weeks before you start feeling especially bad.   Common sense would have told you that the longer you go without eating, the hungrier you get, but it turns out that's totally wrong.   The fundamental goal behind science is putting all of your pre-existing ideas up for challenge, and testing them to see if they deserve to be kept or discarded.   Science is obligated to perform studies on the things we believe to be most obvious, because that's the only way we can continue to get less wrong.
73280	0	a	Could be that Scandinavians generally are less shy when it comes to discussing sex.   Furthermore, citizens of Scandinavian countries are more likely to be educated than an American citizen, so naturally there'll be more studies per citizen.
73281	0	a	Probably both parties are compromising. I read the last sentence as the actual frequency of sex is closer to what women prefer, but not exactly what they want. So men are compromising more but women are also compromising some.
73282	0	a	I guess **more** is the key word.  If I initiate an attempt to have sex 30 times, my gf initiates 10 times and we have sex 15 times it means she compromised in 5 in and out sessions outside of the times she actually wanted.   The man compromised by *not* having sex when he wanted 15 times.   Of course in the study there may have been cases where the woman initiated and the man didn’t want and where the man initiated and the woman wanted, but I assume my explanation lays out the gist of it.   If I give you 10 oranges(compromise 10 times) and you give me 1 orange(compromise 1 time) we both gave oranges(compromised) but we didn’t compromise equally.

73285	0	a	"Not a woman, but I can speak on behalf of my experience with my wife.  We have two kids and there's just some really obvious reasons why our sex life struggled for a while.  * After having kids, women gain weight.  And while I still found my wife attractive, I think it hurt her self-confidence and feeling of ""sexiness"" or desirability.  So her sexual appetite was diminished.  I think mine may have been at a subconscious level as I could see that she was not as attractive for a number of reasons like weight, her general attitude, her grogginess, etc.  (I tried my best to alleviate, but only so much I could do). * After having kids, the body takes a bit of time to recover.  For several months after child birth, we needed lube even for vaginal sex, which we never needed before.  She wanted to have intercourse, but the body was just not cooperating at a biological level. * If you have kids, you realize that kids prefer mothers at night.  This seems to make biological sense because the child spent 9 months inside of the mother and of course, it is the mother that can breastfeed a child in the middle of the night.  So the consequence is that for a few years, the child will refuse anyone at night except for the mother.  In this case, some times my daughter would wake up crying.  I'd go into her room to comfort her and she'd scream for mommy instead.  So my wife got much less sleep than me, which affected her mood, her weight, and her health.  I hang out with my 8 year old at night now, but my 3 year old still wants mommy. * Additionally, kids really don't sleep through the night until they are about 18-24 months old. * Once you have kids, it really diminishes spontaneity; we can't just have sex because we gave each other sexy looks and we're in the mood; we have to get the kids to bed first so sex ends up like a routine and that's not fun for anyone.  So now we plan getaway weekends, but of course, it's expensive.  We have to find ways to kind of break up the monotony. * We keep things very balanced in terms of household responsibilities, but I can imagine that this is a problem in some households where the husband doesn't participate in day-to-day chores.  So we cook together, we clean together, etc. But I can imagine that in some households, this is a big turnoff for women when they are doing all of the household chores.  Prior to having kids, I'd say my wife's sexual appetite was about the same as mine.  During and after kids, it diminished greatly (and perhaps that stronger sexual appetite before child rearing serves a biological purpose of leading to child bearing).  There were some months where I honestly felt like I was living a celibate life.  Now that my kids *actually sleep through the night* and my wife has been able to drop a lot of the weight she gained, our sex life is definitely better and she initiates much more.  I think in my wife's case, the ability to sleep through the night and feeling more self-confident about her body after weight loss helped her regain her sexual appetite.  That our kids are now more independent also helps as we can leave them with sitters for a weekend and have some adult time.  Moral of the story: kids -- don't have them unless you really, really want them."
73286	0	a	"I think it's partially testosterone, and also partially a ""chicken-and-egg"" thing. If the man is initiating at a 3:1 ratio, but it is felt that they have a satisfactory sex life, the woman will simply initiate less on the basis that her needs have already been met. It would then require the man to initiate less, on average, for the woman to feel the ""extra need"", which is unlikely to happen since men have a higher sex drive on average and thus more of a ""need""."

73291	0	a	If not the primary cause I’d wager it’s at least a huge factor in this.
73292	0	a	Looking at the suicide ratio between men and women certainly supports the idea.

73295	0	a	Technically not required. At least in the US, they have to offer an alternative, usually a paper, as punishing you for not participating in a study is considered to be unethical.  The real trick, however, is that it's also unethical to punish someone for dropping out of a study. So if you want to avoid doing any work, just sign up for the study and then withdraw from it and you're free, as requiring you to do the paper after withdrawing would be unethical.
73296	0	a	Could that possibly be because when housework is shared the couple are likely more modern or progressive in how they view gender roles and place less value on staying together vs. divorce? Whereas a relationship where the woman does all the work is likely to place more importance on traditional gender roles and the family unit as well as religious or social beliefs that don't tolerate divorce?
73297	0	a	I would propose that the more a woman is in the home and does the housework the less likely she is to have options for employment, credit history and such. That may make them more likely to stick with a bad marriage and gives the man more control.

73299	0	a	I'm wondering how well the accreted calcium carbonate will bind to each side of the crack, I can imagine if it's weaker than the rest of the concrete any repeated stresses on the block will cause the crack to reopen. 
73300	0	a	Really cool, I wonder how long the fungus can remain dormant? 
73301	0	a	I wonder if this idea came from studying roman concrete built with volcanic rock.
73302	0	a	Better is if it keeps out moisture.  Moisture that freezes in cracks is far more an issue than if the material that fills the cracks in it is strong.
73303	0	a	Since unassisted concrete is mostly used in compressive applications, the bind isn't a huge concern, so long as the patch stays in place. In tensile or bending applications concrete is usually reinforced with steel beams that take the tensile loads.
73304	0	a	What stops the fungi from over filling the crack and growing the structure like coral reef.
73305	0	a	Many types of spores (the majority, IIRC) are capable of long-term viability. On the order of years at the least, and likely decades or maybe even centuries, depending on the type of spore and specific species. I can't tell you why, exactly, but I do know that one of the biggest problems in sterility of lab cultures is the fact that spores are a positive *pain* to kill. 
73306	0	a	I’d also imagine that salt and other de-icing materials would prove deadly to fungi in northern climates.
73307	0	a	Came here to say this. I remember reading an article on here that talked about why Roman concrete was so strong near the sea, and it was because of organisms repairing the concrete.
73308	0	a	But it would need to have a strong bond to maintain contact with the original concrete, or else yes, water seeps in and exacerbates the crack. It doesnt matter how strong the material itself is, in fact a certain amount of softness/pliability would prevent future stress fractures, but if the bond between cement and fungal concrete is weak then it's not good for much.
73309	0	a	An important point your missing is that what you refer to is a population of spores, that as a whole is indeed very hard to eradicate. I imagine that the density in the concrete would be quite low, which means individual survivability is much more important.  For instance, when I collect one billion spores and store them at 4C in saline or water, half of them are non-viable within hours. We also study this heterogeneity in my lab and right now it's still very hard to predict.  Of course survival rate is very species dependent. 
73310	0	a	Most de-icers are already deadly to the concrete itself..
73311	0	a	True, but if it's better than nothing then it can help increase the longevity of the concrete.  If it just keeps out a bit more water than otherwise, then it's still helpful.
73312	0	a	Can you explain this? Seems interesting 
73313	0	a	Which will crack eventually, and the spores will go free, wild concrete growing throughout the world.  A doomsday nobody saw coming.
73314	0	a	All concrete contains some amount of water and is porous.  Deicers such as rock salt lower the freezing point of that water (increasing the frequency of freeze/thaw in colder weather) as well as increasing pressure from frozen water.  This increases the chance of spalling and cracking.  The younger the concrete the more susceptible it is to this as I isn't up to strength yet.  You shouldnt salt a new driveway for 2 years or so 
73315	0	a	Salt also promotes carbonization of the concrete over time, changes the PH which in turn increases the probability of corrosion for the rebars. The spalling and cracking you've talked about also exposes the rebars and again promotes corrosion of the steel. 
73316	0	a	While the correlation might seem obvious, it's good to have solid data measuring the potential consequences of cutting such programs.   Does anyone know of similar studies from other states that track the consequences of cutting family planning programs?

I wouldn't be surprised if this amount is within ordinary random fluctuations of the teen birth rate.  Oh wow just realized we are in r/science. What do you all think of the methodology? Using a binary indicator variable to compare the teen birth rate of counties that did cut funding to those that didn't? I would imagine you should be taking into consideration the actual amount or percentage cut by each county.
73322	0	a	"The title of the article is extremely deceptive. There is no actual spike. In reality, the birthrate for teenagers fell by 25% between 2011 and 2015. But, the 3.4% spike over 4 years is the theoretical difference if funding had sustained in Texas, calculated by comparing to 2011-2015 data of states that had funding.  In other words, the 3.4% spike is a hypothetical ""what if"" scenario.  I doubt anybody will read this comment, but I read the research paper linked from the OP article, and I dug up these statistics:  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr62/nvsr62_01.pdf  On page 8, you see that Texas birth rate for teenagers aged 15-19 was 52.2 in 2010 and 46.9 in 2011.  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_01.pdf  In page 6, we see the 15-19 birthrate went down to 34.6 in 2015 in Texas.  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_01.pdf  On page 37, we find that most of births for people age 15-19 are between 18-19. The birthrate for age 15-17 for Texas is 21.1. The birthrate for age 18-19 for Texas is 72.0.  Even the reddit OP research paper on which the article is based admits the birthrate fell despite funding cuts:  https://www.academia.edu/19435560/Family_Planning_Funding_Cuts_and_Teen_Childbearing  > Before 2011 teen birth rates in Texas average nearly 69 births per 1,000 teens, compared to 45 births per 1,000 teens outside of Texas. *For both groups, teen birth rates fell after 2011.* As such, the analysis below can be viewed as estimating to what extent teen births rates could have declined further in the absence of family planning funding cuts.  The article contradicts itself. It has a summary that claims a spike, but on page 9, admits that the teen birth rates fell in Texas after 2011.  So where does the 3.4% come from?  If you take a look at page 33 of the OP research paper, they got the 3.4% by calculating what the PRESUMED teen birthrate theoretically would be been if the funding hadn't been cut.  This means that while the Texas birthrate did fall consistently between 2011-2015, the researcher claims that it would have fallen by an extra 3.4% if the funding hadn't been cut. It's pure speculation, as you can't rewind time to a parallel dimension to prove yourself right.  So, the reddit title is actually incorrect. There is no spike. Just a prediction offset."

The researcher selected a bunch of countries and states with strong planned parenthood funding, then compared Texas to those. Then it came up with the difference: 3.4% over 4 years.  It's like me cherry picking a bunch of companies with women CEOs, and then comparing it to a specific company, and then told that company ""if you had a woman CEO, you would have made 3.4% more profit."" There's no way to prove me wrong, because you can't rewind time and put a woman CEO, then compare to two outcomes with the same company. Instead, you are comparing different companies that might have thousands of unaccounted factors, and you are just focusing on ONE difference: the gender of the CEO.  Not very scientific, if you ask me. And yes, I read the research paper.  We know that in science, it's important to isolate all unrelated variables. This paper made no such effort. Different countries? Don't care. Different cultures? Don't care. The cheekiness is that the paper actually makes a prediction based on nothing but the funding for planned parenthood, and doesn't even bother to account for all the cultural differences of comparing to a different country.

Cheap and reliable access to contraception has been the most effective method of reducing their most significant complaint (abortion); however, they are handcuffed because premarital sex is a sin, and contraception enables that sin. I know that's not true, but that's their view. And when you consider that these people believe abortion is murder, you can understand why they will not be content until it is strictly illegal.   Soooo, unless someone has a completely novel solution for changing people's most deeply held beliefs, we'll never see the end of this crusade against modern ideas of living. We are trying to reason and intellectually converse against dogmatic, true believers.

73348	0	a	Honestly I think there are plenty of things especially young children should not be exposed to. Commercials are a prime example. Up to a certain age, children generally cannot tell the difference between a commercial and a tv show, and that the purpose of a commercial is to sell a product. Personally I would therefore support banning commercials target at the under six age group, perhaps under eight.   The question is, and I have no answer to this, can young children fully comprehend that onscreen violence is not real, and that what they are seeing should not necessarily be emulated? A 15 year old is obviously not going to go on a shooting spree because of a movie, I think we have moved passed that, but how does repeated exposure to violent content affect a much younger demographic such as four or five year olds? Again I have no answer to this, but I think it should be asked whether exposure at certain ages can be responsible, or whether certain subjects are better learned at a slightly later age.

Journal Reference:  Christopher J. Bryan, David S. Yeager, Cintia P. Hinojosa.   A values-alignment intervention protects adolescents from the effects of food marketing.   Nature Human Behaviour, 2019;   DOI: 10.1038/s41562-019-0586-6  Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0586-6  Abstract  Adolescents are exposed to extensive marketing for junk food, which drives overconsumption by creating positive emotional associations with junk food1,2,3,4,5,6. Here we counter this influence with an intervention that frames manipulative food marketing as incompatible with important adolescent values, including social justice and autonomy from adult control. In a preregistered, longitudinal, randomized, controlled field experiment, we show that this framing intervention reduces boys’ and girls’ implicit positive associations with junk food marketing and substantially improves boys’ daily dietary choices in the school cafeteria. Both of these effects were sustained for at least three months. These findings suggest that reframing unhealthy dietary choices as incompatible with important values could be a low-cost, scalable solution to producing lasting, internalized change in adolescents’ dietary attitudes and choices.

73353	0	a	“Tapping the adolescents desire to rebel” just seems like a strange focus for the study. It’s often generalized that teenagers want to “rebel” but I don’t think that’s an innate quality that can be assigned to them. Especially for scientific purposes it feels weird.  I think exposing people to bad business practices and making people more informed is enough to create that same 31 percent drop. Regardless of the age group. It’s mindful consumerism, not some deeper level of adolescent psychology.

I realize WebMD isn't the BEST source in the world, but I feel this article sums it up- basically, teenagers aren't rebellious by default, but their brains are growing in ways that encourage them to take risks and begin establishing an identity outside of the family unit, in order to prepare them for leaving the nest to begin an independent life. These changes express themselves in a way we tend to think of as ""rebellious."""
73355	0	a	If the participants were recruited through websites devoted to drug discussion/research, wouldn't this be sampling bias?  Someone who took psychedelics and didn't enjoy the experience likely isn't visiting drug related websites
73356	0	a	Some details from the study (taken directly from this article):  They collected data on 343 participants, who had reported at least seven years of problematic drinking before they had a psychedelic experience.  Interestingly, ten percent of this group took the drugs with the hope they could help them reduce their reliance on alcohol.   The survey results showed a dramatic change in the number of alcoholic drinks people consumed before taking a “moderate or high dose” of either LSD or psilocybin and the number of drinks they were consuming a year later.   After their drug experience, 83 percent of the participants no longer met the criteria for having alcohol use disorder. In turn, 28 percent of the participants reported that their psychedelic experience was the reason they decided to change their lifestyle.  Small sample size, but interesting results nonetheless.
73357	0	a	This study is seriously reliant on self-reporting from drug-use forums?

73359	0	a	"JH has been running studies for years where they don't recruit from drug discussion websites, and they get similar results. The amount of ""bad trips"" is basically nonexistant, as their protocol involves 8 hours of rapport building and prep work with the therapists that will be present for the experience. Set, setting, and expectations are key in determining how the trip is going to go and you can basically guarantee a good trip with adequate prep work.  That being said, I'd be interested in Hopkins running this in a lab with their current psychedelic protocols, and gathering data that's more valid than self-report measures, especially with a population that is known to minimize or outright deny ongoing substance use and abuse."
73360	0	a	It's my understanding that the biggest issue with scientifically studying hallucinogens is the placebo side of a double blind study. Patients will be well aware if they have taken the drug or the placebo.
73361	0	a	343 is not a terribly small sample size. What would the margin of error be on that 28 percent? Would it contain zero at 95% confidence?  Edit: Highly recommend reading the discussion below.

73362	0	a	The researchers recruited participants through drug forums and then reached out to them. Still self reported, but better than pulling data straight from posting history.
73363	0	a	I believe this is why the researchers of a similar study put out the following warning on their press release (also from John Hopkins):  >But the study results are not an endorsement of do-it-yourself psychedelic drug use for smoking cessation — they’re the result of specific, controlled administration of psilocybin in the context of a treatment program involving cognitive behavioral therapy.  Seems like they take precautions to ensure everything goes as smoothly as possible.
73364	0	a	It's exclusion bias, which is a type of selection bias.   They excluded anyone who did not reduce their drinking after having a psychedelic experience.  They literally only interviewed people who reduced their drinking after a psychedelic experience. From the [abstract](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881119845793?journalCode=jopa&):  > **Methods**: An anonymous online survey of individuals with prior AUD reporting cessation or reduction in alcohol use following psychedelic use in nonclinical settings.  This tells us nothing about the expected outcomes for alcoholics.
73365	0	a	"Somebody asked how they guaranteed a good trip and it got deleted. I typed all this up and don't want it to go to waste, so here we go!  I actually got a chance to ask Dr. Griffiths this question at a conference a couple months ago! I was so nervous!  From the best of my knowledge (and I hope someone fills in my gaps here) the prep work and actual therapy that goes into the psychedelic experience revolves around making the client as comfortable as possible. First, they screen out anyone who has psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia) that psychedelics are known to exacerbate. Many bad trips happen because people have latent and unaddressed psychiatric disorders that they are not prepared to confront in a trip, so there is a robust assessment process. Second, they have two sessions with the therapists that function as rapport building exercises. Being comfortable with the therapists who are in the room with you eliminates and unknown - the client knows and trusts the people guiding them through the unfamiliar experience, and understands they are there should any scary or distressing situations arise. There is a level of comfort that that provides that keeps things from spiraling. Third, they are given a set of ""flight instructions"" that explicitly give instructions as to how to deal with what you will about to experience. For example, they will say things such as ""If you see a door, open it and walk through it. If you see a monster, don't run from it, but walk up to it and ask it why it's there and what it has to teach you."" Having a plan for unexpected situations gives a sense of control to the experience, with the guides there to facilitate this kind of insight. Fourth, the dosage is controlled. Many bad trips happen from people taking far too much than they intended to, which leads to panic when they realize they are tripping far too hard for them to control. After the rapport building exercise, meeting with the team, and being in the hospital environment, clients trust that they are given a therapeutic dose and they are having the exact experience that they are expected to have. Fifth, the psychedelic session itself. Clients are given a comfortable couch to lay on with eye shades, a specifically curated playlist with classical music intended to facilitate comfort and insight, in a cozy room that's decorated and designed to induce a warm and inviting feeling. Considering all of these variables are controlled, the likelihood of something going wrong is basically nonexistant.  If you are asking about how you guarantee a good trip if you are taking it recreationally... there's really no way to do so and you do it at your own risk."
73366	0	a	There will for sure be that one guy who gets the placebo but acts like he's tripping balls though.
73367	0	a	The problem is always the lack of controls, etc, in these studies. You're dealing with people who drink, and are interested in trying psychedelics...It's a self-selected, oddball group.   I'm definitely interested in the therapeutic uses of psychedelics,  especially in cases like this, dealing with addiction, and depression.
73368	0	a	It's a major sampling bias that systematically fails to recruit people that do not or would not use psychedelics, including people who used psychedelics before but didn't like the experience.   Survey participants most likely had a positive view of psychedelics already.  Even with that caveat it's useful information, but it's important to keep in mind before extrapolating to all alcoholics.

73372	0	a	I always hate science reported in the news because they really don't appreciate what scientific studies really mean.  This study doesn't mean that LSD cures alcoholism.  What this study means is that the scientific community ought to run a double blind, properly controlled, study into whether we should devote the resources needed to do a double blind, properly controlled, large sample size study that is designed to be replicated and used in public policy debates, about whether LSD cures alcoholism.  The results of that study will tell us whether LSD cures alcoholism with a pretty good degree of confidence.  The point of this research is about allocating resources for future research - not proving the topline issue.
73373	0	a	IV is the independent variable. Examples of levels for the IV in this case might be: control group, 1mg dose, 2mg dose, 3 mg dose, etc.   (I have no idea about how LSD is typically measured. These dosages are just examples)

We asked Americans to nominate America's greatest year, their personal greatest year, and to explain why they nominated those years. Americans could not agree on America's greatest year. Instead, some Americans nominated years when nationally relevant events occurred, such as 1776 and 1945. Others nominated years when they were between 0 and 20 years old; people nominated a similar pattern of years when asked the year they were at their personal greatest. Our findings establish, for the first time, a set of memories for the events that shape America's identity. Our findings also add to the literature on the reminiscence bump, showing that decisions about America's greatest time and one's personal greatest time are most likely to occur during one's youth.
73383	0	a	I wonder if this will still hold up? I read once that in the Middle Ages, the average person was in full realization that they weren’t living in the best of times, because the ruins around them had better amenities than what they had.  Not quite there right now, but I wonder if kids today feel the obvious reduced opportunity compared to say the 1960s-1990s.   Edit: A few things: 1) I’m defining “opportunity” as wealth and collectively across all individuals in the US. I agree that minority opportunities in the US are much improved today.  And as a white, straight, male, I admit I did not factor that in when posing this question.  2) “Obvious” meaning the count of opportunities to increase net income per capita is reduced. I have no data to support this but I would say stagnating wages while education/healthcare sharply increase is an indicator. If I could, I may measure as number of times the 50th percentile net income line was crossed per year relative to total possible opportunities.  Does anyone have this data? 3) I don’t really consider opportunities  to become mega rich through tech as a core factor for the question I posed, and is more of a distraction. I would consider those outliers given they are relatively few. I would compare this to opportunities European explorers of the “New World” faced. 
73384	0	a	But.... Isn't economically for the average person things have been getting worse and worse? Wage has stagnated while inflation and cost of living has gone up and up and up since the 70s. My dad from the 50s said someone working the most basic job could support a family.   I don't think people from the 30s and 40s would agree with this article, but I don't think you've asked them.
73385	0	a	Another factor could be that they were too young to understand how messed up the world actually was during that time. For example, someone growing up in the 90s might not remember the AIDS and crack epidemic of that decade because they weren't at the age that would be exposed to those things. Their youth could have just been their most sheltered life. Because otherwise, nostalgia could have pointed them to another age range like 20-30s if they're in their 50-70s. But the study says 0-20 was the age group most picked.

But the properties of that ice—how pure it is, how deep it goes, what shape it takes—remain a mystery to planetary geologists.  Then later the article goes on to say:  > Fortunately, land erodes. Forget radar and drilling robots: Locate a spot of land laid bare by time, and you have a direct line of sight on Mars' subterranean layers—and any ice deposited there.  > Now, scientists have discovered such a site.   and   > researchers led by USGS planetary geologist Colin Dundas present detailed observations of eight Martian regions where erosion has uncovered large, steep cross-sections of underlying ice. It’s not just the volume of water they found (it's no mystery that Mars harbors a lot of ice in these particular regions), it’s how mineable it promises to be. The deposits begin at depths as shallow as one meter and extend upwards of 100 meters into the planet. The researchers don't estimate the quantity of ice present, but they do note that the amount of ice near the surface is likely more extensive than the few locations where it's exposed. And what's more, the ice looks pretty damn pure.
73408	0	a	How can they tell that it's pure at all? The title implies it's somewhat usable in its current state, how do they know this?
73409	0	a	"That's *liquid* water, this is ice. And it's an overstatement to say the evidence for water got flimsier. The paper you're thinking of simply said that some evidence was consistent with debris flows rather than water. That same evidence isn't *inconsistent* with liquid water, it's just saying that we shouldn't rule out dry debris. However, in order to explain the seasonality and surface distribution of these features, some amount of water was still invoked as a likely cause.  EDIT: I should make clear here that RSL aren't really my thing, so it's possible the paper was firmer on the ""no water"" thing than I'm making it out. This was simply my impression. ""Some of these things match what you would expect from debris flows"" seemed to be the general thrust, but evidence in favor of debris flows isn't necessarily evidence against water, especially given the seasonality of these features and the preference for equator-facing (warmer) slopes. My non-expert opinion is that we still don't really understand what these things are."

And here we are sitting with all of our eggs in the same basket.  That argument doesn't work for anything except fully self-sustaining colonies. Anything that requires any kind of assistance from earth would die along with the rest of us if something actually wiped us out. And besides a fair number of the possible extinction events would be things that would effect Mars too. (A gamma ray burst isn't really something we can prepare for, but also isn't something that would be likely to affect only earth either).   Meteor impacts can be predicted and diverted. And that is certainly something to invest in, but investing in it would STILL be cheaper than building fully independent colonies would be.  A disease wouldn't wipe out humanity, it could kill a significant part of humanity, but it wouldn't be a total extinction event. Besides which a arctic-colony or similar that didn't accept outside visitors would provide *exactly* as much protection as a space colony, and at a fraction of the price.  Nuclear war is the most likely cause of human extinction at this time. However, if you have the technology to build a sustainable space-colony, you have to have strong Radiation Shielding, and oxygen and food recycling/generation that is independent of earth. And with that tech you could ALSO just build a bunker on earth that would be capable of sustaining itself indefinitely even should the surface become uninhabitable due to the effects of nuclear war. The only benefit then is that it protects you better if the person declaring nuclear war is targeting you specifically, but that seems unlikely to happen. (and lets be honest, if someone gets a strong enough murder boner interplanetary warfare is far from impossible anyway, just difficult).  I'm not saying that colonization is not a valuable goal, I'm saying that I hate this argument, especially in regards to pushing for early off-planet colonies that wouldn't be truly sustainable independent anyway.  Personally I see interplanetary/stellar colonization as practically an inevitability. But rather than colonies I would rather be pushing towards space-mining and/or orbital rings. Both of which pose far greater purpose in the present than a mars colony would.  Though on the other hand, while I do think colonization is inevitable, I don't think *Human* colonization is. It seems likely that whenever we do start living among the stars it will be as some form of digital upload, since that neatly side-steps a lot of issues and is more efficient besides. Meat-bodies really just aren't made to be anywhere other than earth, it's not what they evolved for."
73432	0	a	>It’s gravity that keeps the atmosphere in place, not the atmosphere.   This is only partially true. Mars lacks a strong magnetosphere, which is what keeps the atmosphere from being blasted away by solar winds. This is actually more important than the surface gravity for retaining an atmosphere.
73433	0	a	Yeah even with Mars' current thin atmosphere it would still take about 2 billion years to lose what it has, so if we terraform we will have a few billion years to give Mars a magnetoshpere.
73434	0	a	This is true with anything. Want your kids to be physically active? Be physically active. Want your kids to eat well? Eat well. Want your kids to be patient, kind, good listeners? Be patient, kind, and a good listener. Kids literally copy what they see in front of them all the time.

73441	0	a	I think the mealtime thing is just direct correlation to how much parents let their kids on the screens.  Mealtime would be the one big time where you'd think no one would be on screens, even if you let them do it before/after meals.  So if you're willing to let your kids sit on their phones and iPads during dinner, you probably don't care about them being on them any other time of the day either.
73442	0	a	Hypocrisy is just not a good teaching tool. Admonishing children for something the parents/adults are liberally indulging in just makes the criticism seem illegitimate or nonsensical.

Additionally, the impact of parents modelling screen time is an important factor. Last, if parents are on their screens they essentially eliminate opportunities to socialize and kids will look for what options there are.   Unfortunately, this study focused on a very young age group that is pretty easy to control directly. I'd like to see how such behavior plays out with tweens and teens.

73448	0	a	In case people are interested, the published paper is available [here](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/84/3/1210/3091869/High-Achievers-Cannabis-Access-and-Academic), but requires institutional access. A pre-print version of the paper (from 2016) is freely available [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2871909) or [here](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/149505/1/16101.pdf). An even earlier discussion paper version from 2015 is available [here](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED558043.pdf).  To summarize, they applied a difference-in-differences analysis, which is basically an ANOVA if you are familiar with that method. Originally all students at a school were permitted to legally purchase marijuana. At some point this was changed so that foreign students were not allowed, but local ones were. This allows the researchers to compare the difference in grades from before and after for local students against the difference in grades for foreign ones (hence, difference-in-differences).   Note that this means that this is explicitly NOT a result saying that people who smoke weed do worse. The population for each group is (hopefully) roughly the same before and after the intervention. This is instead evidence that, *on average*, when college students' legal access to marijuana *is cut off*, they do better in school. Because of the natural experiment setup, this is not just a correlational result; it actually does provide causal evidence for its conclusion, though how strong you think that evidence is depends on how compelling you find the paper.  Remember that when using this kind of non-experimental data there are always criticisms that can be made against the setup and experiment. But without knowing all the details, this seems to be about as good as natural experiment studies ever get and they found pretty strong results.

73454	0	a	I was about to post the paper when I saw your post.    A few things that stand out and should have been pointed in the article are :  * That dropout rates didn't seem to be affected (the article even implies the opposite),   * That the study was for students taking classes that required mostly mathematical/logical skills (which are often thought to be more affected by cannabis consumption),   * That the cannabis available to the students is very potent compared to what most people get (around twice the THC amount compared to what is typically seen in America).   The one big flaw I see in their paper is that there is no way of knowing how many students continued to get cannabis illegally, and how well the ones who did performed.    Edit: Holy cow! My first gold. Thank you anonymous kind soul.

73456	0	a	Specifically, those banned from cannabis cafes had a more than 5 percent increase in their odds of passing their courses. Low performing students benefited even more, which the researchers noted is particularly important because these students are at high-risk of dropping out.  The article clearly states that there is a larger impact on low performing students, and the impact likely follows an exponential growth function.
73457	0	a	All students have access to alcohol.  Some choose not to drink or to not drink all the time.

73462	0	a	I just read the paper myself. Mostly because, as a Maastricht University student, I wanted to see if the paper addresses the differences between baseline academic performance of different nationalities at UM*.   Unfortunately you are wrong about two things:  * The study shows a drop in performance in across all subjects, it's just that the impact on mathematical classes is about 5 times higher. This is used as evidence that the cannabis consumption was indeed the deciding factor because medical research shows that mathematical and logical skills are the most strongly impaired by cannabis consumption.  * Edit: I have been advised that this part of the post may be breaking this sons rule on anecdotal evidence. For this reason i have reposted it in a separate post, but I'll be leaving it here in crossed out form in order to give context to the rest of the comment chain.  ~~No, you cannot just get cannabis illegally in Maastricht. Speaking as somebody who has lived in the city for four years now: You can't just buy cannabis for other people, coffee shops are very strictly regulated and terrified of loosing their business license if they are found to be breaking the rules. You either consume your cannabis legally with your government issued ID inside of legal cannabis store or you don't consume any at all. Whats more, because cannabis is legal there are basically no illegal distribution channels (at least none that are available to normal students, let alone students from outside the Netherlands/Germany/Belgium).~~   *German students at UM have significantly higher grades then Dutch students, not because German are smarter but because German students going out of their way to to enroll at UM are generally high achievers. Turns out this doesn't affect the results of the study because 1) German and Dutch students are lumped together for the sake of the analysis and 2) the study analyses the performance of the same individuals during the (short) period of cannabis prohibition.
73463	0	a	Here you go!     The most rigorous study yet of the effects of marijuana legalization has identified a disturbing result: College students with access to recreational cannabis on average earn worse grades and fail classes at a higher rate.   Economists Olivier Marie and Ulf Zölitz took advantage of a decision by Maastricht, a city in the Netherlands, to change the rules for “cannabis cafes,” which legally sell recreational marijuana. Because Maastricht is very close to the border of multiple European countries (Belgium, France and Germany), drug tourism was posing difficulties for the city. Hoping to address this, the city barred noncitizens of the Netherlands from buying from the cafes.   This policy change created an intriguing natural experiment at Maastricht University, because students there from neighboring countries suddenly were unable to access legal pot, while students from the Netherlands continued.   The research on more than 4,000 students, published in the Review of Economic Studies, found that those who lost access to legal marijuana showed substantial improvement in their grades. Specifically, those banned from cannabis cafes had a more than 5 percent increase in their odds of passing their courses. Low performing students benefited even more, which the researchers noted is particularly important because these students are at high-risk of dropping out. The researchers attribute their results to the students who were denied legal access to marijuana being less likely to use it and to suffer cognitive impairments (e.g., in concentration and memory) as a result.   Other studies have tried to estimate the impact of marijuana legalization by studying those U.S. states that legalized medicinal or recreational marijuana. But marijuana policy researcher Rosalie Pacula of RAND Corporation noted that the Maastricht study provide evidence that “is much better than anything done so far in the United States.”   States differ in countless ways that are hard for researchers to adjust for in their data analysis, but the Maastricht study examined similar people in the same location — some of them even side by side in the same classrooms — making it easier to isolate the effect of marijuana legalization. Also, Pacula pointed out that since voters in U.S. states are the ones who approve marijuana legalization, it creates a chicken and egg problem for researchers (i.e. does legalization make people smoke more pot, or do pot smokers tend to vote for legalization?). This methodological problem was resolved in the Maastricht study because the marijuana policy change was imposed without input from those whom it affected.   Although this is the strongest study to date on how people are affected by marijuana legalization, no research can ultimately tell us whether legalization is a good or bad decision: That’s a political question and not a scientific one. But what the Maastricht study can do is provides highly credible evidence that marijuana legalization will lead to decreased academic success — perhaps particularly so for struggling students — and that is a concern that both proponents and opponents of legalization should keep in mind.

73467	0	a	The point is not having legal access means youre less likely to have access to weed at all. Simply not being allowed to do something is something that leads, on average, to people doing that thing less! Of course prohibition is never entirely effective and this study isn't necessarily a reason to make it illegal, but it's worth considering the health risks of any drug you do.  Edit: Stop sending that teen usage study to me. Marijuana is not legal for teenagers in the United States anywhere, therefore I would not expect teen usage to increase. You got that?  Edit 2: That study also directly proves my point, apparently.  >Conversely, adult marijuana use rose significantly in Colorado over the same time period. Among Coloradans ages 26 and older, past-year marijuana use rose from 16.80 percent in 2013/2014 to 19.91 percent in 2014/2015. Annual adult marijuana use was up in most states during the same time frame. The legal marijuana markets in Colorado, Washington and elsewhere feature strict age and purchasing limits.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/21/one-of-the-greatest-fears-about-legalizing-marijuana-has-so-far-failed-to-happen/?utm_term=.7bb5fde6b4db

Clearly, this is anecdotal - but I studied in Ghent 10 years ago. Whenever my friends (m'n 'kotgenoten') wanted to smoke - they'd drive to Maastricht and return with a stash (Actually, they'd call a local guy who made that trip weekly - but I digress).  Whenever I visit a friend who lives there now, he's got a stash at home, and he's offering us some every time we're there.  I don't indulge - but *clearly* it's nowhere near as hard to get drugs illegally as you're making it out to.

For the United States, the UNODC (2012) reports an average THC strength of 8.6 percent in confiscated (illegal) cannabis. Some recent evidence from preliminary lab tests on Colorado’s legally purchased marijuana revealed an average concentration level of 18.7 percent in 2015 (LaFrate & Armentano [2015])
73472	0	a	It doesn't sound like a very well controlled study. Could it just be that it was more difficult for the foreign students to get in, so they're more likely to do well in school? It seems like there could be all kinds of variables that could account for the results.

As you can imagine, I don't think this study is very well-controlled. Interesting, but ultimately, poorly controlled. I am sure there are a slew of additional critiques about the study design that could be made, but the study does not appear to actually be linked.  One simple observation could be that students without easy access to marijuana in social situations like these cafes instead spent time doing things like studying, or at the very least, not intoxicated. It is easy to see how that could impact any population. It is not hard to imagine that in destitute, foreign, and/or disadvantaged populations this could have an even more substantial effect, as observed."
73475	0	a	I was stopped at a stoplight in the city once when a guy walked up to my window and asked if I wanted coke or heroin.....he actually held them both up for me to see.   Later, when I was crossing the border into Belgium, I mentioned we had been to Maastricht and the guy immediately asked what drugs we had. We were searched for almost an hour.   My anecdotal conclusion: there is definitely an illegal drug market in Maastricht. 
73476	0	a	This is a good point, but comparing marijuana potency with even just a 3 year gap in data would make a big difference. Marijuana potency has increased rapidly and now most illegal states have the same product that's sold legally. It might cost more and/or be harder to find, but you can find the same stuff no matter where you are if you know the right person. The massive difference in averages is likely due to the option/convenience of lower quality product in illegal states. When you can get 14% THC legally, why pay close to the same amount for 8% or lower? If no one buys it, it isn't confiscated. IMO that data is misleading.

They *also* thought that since clearly they don't work hard yet complain they are doubly lazy and whiny.   When they realized their family wouldn't just send them lots of money and they had to get jobs to support themselves their attitudes quickly changed once they had to work with and work like the poor people they assumed were lazy.

73491	0	a	It's not necessarily a case of acting like the people around you - that would suggest that poor people tend to be more prosocial, generous and egalitarian themselves, and that's not what the study's saying.    It's more that when you spend a lot of time around people much worse off for you gain an insight into how difficult some things are for them and how little of it is intrinsically their fault,  and you start to be more tolerant of it.   I was a rich (relatively) kid in an extremely poor school, and I played with the poor kids and went over their houses and listened to their parents talk about how they needed to go to the food bank, and how they needed to wait till the end of the month, when their pay came in to get new shoes for their kid so she'd just have to wear the broken ones till then - all just casual chatter to each other while I was eating some of what little food they had - and yeah, it has made me understanding of people who are in difficulty.  And it does go two ways too. I got a hell of a lot of stick in school for being posh - at least I did once my mum came to pick me up and they heard her very-not-regional accent - because there's always intolerance towards kids who are different from the norm, but when those kids came round my house and met my mum they realised 'wait, people who speak like this are actually people and \_not\_ all awful snobs? And they became more accepting too.  So yeah, it's not that people start acting like the people they're around, at least not on more than a surface level (gestures, accent and word choice definitely do shift though), it's that they come to be able to understand those people and actually see them as people. They start to empathise with them.

Most of these people are relatively fit, and don't have kids. My other friend group are my and my husband's college friends, who nearly all have young children. We mostly interact through playing board games, etc. and most of this group are overweight.  I feel very fat and unfit in the one group and am motivated to work out more.

Projecting these individuals across the same backdrop facilitates quantifying disparities in media visibility and scientific authority, and identifying organization patterns within their association networks. Here we show via direct comparison that contrarians are featured in 49% more media articles than scientists. Yet when comparing visibility in mainstream media sources only, we observe just a 1% excess visibility, which objectively demonstrates the crowding out of professional mainstream sources by the proliferation of new media sources, many of which contribute to the production and consumption of climate change disinformation at scale. These results demonstrate why climate scientists should increasingly exert their authority in scientific and public discourse, and why professional journalists and editors should adjust the disproportionate attention given to contrarians.

It's like the people who talk about how the world will end on x date, that date comes and passes, nothing happens, they say that their math was wrong or something and eventually nobody believes them. Instead of pushing fear mongering stories that eventually will just make people's eyes roll we really need to be talking about the pros of clean energy."

It's more like, a climate change contrarian is 49% more likely to be personally invited by the media to defend their views on climate change than is a proponent. Proponents are probably covered far more overall, but the 386 experts were not personally interviewed as often as the 386 contrarians. And why would they? There is 32x as much competition for that media coverage.

73511	0	a	I think there is some psychology to this as well. All the headlines you suggested do sound appealing, but even the boring climate change articles tend to make the reader afraid for the future, think disaster is imminent, and ashamed of how they have contributed to the calamity. Compare that to climate-change-denier stories, which sizzle or not, tells the reader that they are okay, the world isn’t going to end, and they didn’t do anything wrong to the earth. People likely prefer the second message over the first.  Let’s also bear in mind that most climate change articles are action research - they are not simply analyzing a situation, but advocating for a change in policy. That means people may be amenable to the conclusions, but not agree with the policy change. People also tend to automatically mistrust research that is connected to policy change because they suspect the authors were biased in conducting the research.

In fact there was an article I’m too lazy to look up from a newspaper in the late 19th or early 20th century that talks about global warming. It’s hard to connect that to one’s self.  It helps when we talk about what each person can do... for instance, water conservation is very important and for those of us who grew up with endless running water, it can be hard to see that. However, we learned to turn off the sink while brushing teeth, take shorter showers, install hot water circulating systems and that gets everyone engaged. People have gone crazy with #trashtag, which is not only making an impact cleaning public spaces but bringing awareness and thought to the concepts of taking care of our environment.  There’s not much I can do about “the most significant ice melt in the history of Greenland”, but I can do something about my personal choices on consumption and conservation. Not all problems can be solved this way, but it seems to get people on the same side as each other, the side of Humanity, and that is a critical foundation to solving a global issue of any kind.

Adolescent cannabis use, change in neurocognitive function, and high-school graduation: A longitudinal study from early adolescence to young adulthood.

The results showed that in early adolescence, and prior to initiation to CU, poor short-term and working memory, but high verbal IQ, were associated with earlier age of onset of CU. In turn, age of CU onset and CU frequency across adolescence were associated with (a) specific neurocognitive decline in verbal IQ and executive function tasks tapping trial and error learning and reward processing by early adulthood and (b) lower rates of high-school graduation. The association between CU onset and change in neurocognitive function, however, was found to be accounted for by CU frequency. Whereas the link between CU frequency across adolescence and change in verbal IQ was explained (mediated) by high school graduation, the link between CU frequency and tasks tapping trial and error learning were independent from high school graduation, concurrent cannabis and other substance use, adolescent alcohol use, and externalizing behaviors. Findings support prevention efforts aimed at delaying onset and reducing frequency of CU.

73535	0	a	"> she is trying to show a causal link being drug use and mental illness  Well we already know it causes an increased incidence of Schizophrenia in genetically vulnerable populations. It's also known as a particularly bad exacerbate for bipolar disoder, which is notable because it can push some people up beyond the diagnosis threshold ""creating"" bipolars in a sense. Mind you, bipolar sufferers are supposed to avoid alcohol and caffeine as well so it's not like marijuana is unique in that way.  But beyond that I've never heard of other mental illness being caused by it. Issues with memory and perception of time in heavy users are fairly well documented at this point. None of this really supports the drug being banned when alcohol and tobacco are legal though.  Edit: Rather than replying individually, I'm just going to put this here. The study that confirms the link between schizophrenia and cannabis abuse is talked about in this [article](https://www.fhi.no/en/news/2016/cannabis-abuse-psychosis/). It's a golden standard study and includes twin pairs. Every time I bring this up I get intense backlash over it so I come prepped.  Edit2: Since people are also asking about bipolar a study found [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/div-classtitleadditive-effects-of-childhood-abuse-and-cannabis-abuse-on-clinical-expressions-of-bipolar-disordersdiv/63BAA895531944B7AB027683AC7D5619) covers that cannabis abuse is both more common in bipolars, and after accounting for all other variables also an aggravator of the disease. Therapeutic use of cannabinoids and recreational use/abuse are two different things. Even if in controlled doses they show potentially useful effects, that doesn't mean binging on the drug is harmless to the disorder.  Edit3: Although not mentioned, I'm fairly certain the negative impacts are about the significantly more common Type 2 Bipolar, and not the Type 1 Bipolar. The fact that rapid cycling got brought up supports this. They are very different diseases."

73549	0	a	"I think the big issues with the Paris Agreements have less to do with science and more to do with funding and politics.  Man made climate change exists. Anyone with an iota of critical reasoning should be able to look at the myriad of peer reviewed papers and interviews with credentialed experts on the subject, and logically come to the conclusion that this is an enormous problem that can only be tackled effectively on a global scale.  HOWEVER... the Paris Agreements are:  A) ineffective (allowing countries to tailor reduction goals in any way they seem fit)  B) toothless (no punishments for missing targets; ""peer pressure"" is how some of the developed world expects to ensure emerging markets keep their end of the bargain)  C) expensive ($100 billion a year minimum, from wealthy developed nations to emerging economies, in order to offset the cost of using more expensive ""green"" technology)  **NOTE: Depending on which article you read, the $100 billion dollar figure is either a yearly total paid by all the big developed countries... or the figure to be contributed yearly just by us in the USA. To date, we have pledged around 30% of the total funds for the United Nations Green Climate Fund ($3 billion from us, $7 billion from 42 other countries, for a little over $10 billion total). So I think it's fair to say that the amount would've been between $30 and $100 billion yearly from the US to other countries**  That's a lot of money to give away to other nations with no guarantees that they will follow through on their end, especially since the recipients include our economic competitors such as China and India. For comparison's sake, $30 billion is the amount America spends yearly on humanitarian aid throughout the world. This money could definitely yield better short term results if pumped into similar programs (clean water/combating AIDS or other diseases/lessening poverty), whether domestic or abroad.   On the other hand, the US spends almost $4 trillion dollars a year; this is a small percentage to pay for us to combat such a large scale problem... especially when we know we'll be seeing multi-trillion dollar economic reductions once it starts to get real bad in the 2080's and the 2090's.   Personally, I think the Paris Agreement was nothing more than political grandstanding, a proverbial pat on the back for all the world leaders. ""We did something about climate change, yay!"" I understand that it's hard to get almost 200 countries to agree on something, but the current language is so weak that it is practically useless. As Americans, what we need to do is push our elected officials to come up with a legitimate and detailed plan that actually spells out the monetary costs associated and the targets that must be met. It really doesn't have to be so expansive in number of countries - if we could get China, India, Pakistan, and the EU on board, we'd have the majority of the world's greenhouse gas emitters right there with us. Then we could use ""peer pressure"" to convince the smaller ones left. It is a much more rational and substantive way forward.   Now, is the current administration going to lead the way forward with this? Almost certainly not. But that's a topic for another day.

73558	0	a	Not a stupid question at all. While Trump announced his desire to withdraw, many other groups and individuals in the US, such as states like California, individual cities and businesses can still adhere to more stringent emissions goals, for example. Individual states do have environmental laws that are more stringent than federal regulations, so even if they were rolled back nationally, states such as CA and NY are still adhering to these climate targets.   Individual companies as well are moving towards clean energy, even energy companies like Exxon Mobil (In fact, Trump's Secretary of State, for Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, acknowledged the effects of man-made climate change and how Exxon Mobil postured itself accordingly...so he quite literally is opposing Trump on this issue) The cost of solar power has dropped substantially over the past several years so economically there is a stronger case against coal, and the solar power industry even employs more Americans than the coal industry  The real impact will probably be in the respect that the US has on the global scene, or more specifically, how Trump is viewed globally. With the *entire* world behind the agreement, he stands as much of an outlier. This is now an opportunity for other nations to claim the mantle as the global leader on environmentalism.   I'm cautiously optimistic. Not optimistic for the planet as much as I am optimistic for the future of the agreement. I think there is too much of a push *for* more stringent climate regulations in the US for  this withdrawal to hurt our progress

It could struggle to favorably renegotiate NAFTA, for instance. Leaving Paris could also damage American companies and economic innovation while needlessly ceding diplomatic ground to China.

73562	0	a	As far as I'm aware, it can't both be a symbolic act *and* cost taxpayers trillions. Either it's mostly meaningless, or it's binding and harmful to taxpayers and the economy. I don't see how both can be true.  Furthermore, fighting climate change will cost money, but it's something that needs to be done regardless of whether or not we remain in the Paris agreement.   Via the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/climate/qa-the-paris-climate-accord.html):  >Unlike its predecessor treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris deal was **intended to be nonbinding, so that countries could tailor their climate plans to their domestic situations and alter them as circumstances changed. There are no penalties for falling short of declared targets.** The hope was that, through peer pressure and diplomacy, these policies would be strengthened over time.  Based on that information, I'm not sure how the second and third bullet could be true.
73563	0	a	Wouldn't a push for greener energy create an entirely new industry with a lot more jobs?  I know jobs would be lost in some areas, but wouldn't they be offset somewhat by gains in another sector doing R&D, building infrastructure to support it, etc.? I have a science background not a business/economics background so sorry if this sounds dumb. I just feel like it's not an either-or scenario. Gain some, lose some. We don't know the concrete numbers
73564	0	a	">it will have a modest, mostly symbolic impact of surface temperatures (less than 2 degrees if fully implemented)  That's the goal of the agreement. To limit growth to 2°C. This is not a ""modest, symbolic impact"". [We're predicting 2 °C to 10 °C changes over the next hundred years.](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/) Only 2°C would be phenomenal.  >it will cost tax US taxpayers trillions  And the costs of climate change are in the trillions as well. Rising sea levels and higher temperatures affect crop growth and population distribution. I'd like to see more explicit reasons how this ""trillions"" was come up with. Over how long a period? Trillions towards what, exactly? To who? This is a very hand-wavy reason.   >it will be harmful for the US economy  The Heritage Foundation is a known conservative think-tank who [applauds the removal from the Climate Agreement](http://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/heritage-applauds-paris-climate-agreement-withdrawal). I'd hardly call that a valid source for those claims."
73565	0	a	I have been reading research for a while and compiling a simple bullet list. If anyone spots a mistake or would like to add something let me know.  FOOD:  * **eat less meat, dairy, and other animal products** (none is the best) * eat less industrially produced food, less processed food, less packaged foods (for example, bottled water uses energy to be packaged, produces waste, needs energy to be refrigerated, so drink tap water) * eat proper portion sizes  ENERGY:  * don't be afraid of nuclear power plants * buy solar panels * use efficient lightbulbs, turn the lights off when you're not in the room * insulate your home, don't warm or cool the rooms more than necessary * if at all possible forgo living in a single-family house in favor of apartment-style housing. (That way more people get to live on less land, sharing of walls is more energy efficient, commutes are shorter etc.) * criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much * **drive less, cycle and walk as much as possible**  WASTE  * buy recyclable items (q-tips with paper stick instead of plastic, bamboo toothbrushes, etc.) * recycle * don't buy more than you need (but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging) * avoid items with too much packaging * avoid single-use items (don't use disposable cutlery, disposable wipes, if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons, etc.) * contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging  WATER:  * don't flush the toilet when not necessary * don't throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids and toilet paper (no cotton pads, no q-tips, no floss, no tampons, no cigarette butts, no paper towels...) * turn the water off while you are lathering, brushing your teeth etc. * cut down on showers and baths * don't water your lawns, try to plant local plants that don't need watering  ACTIVISM:  * Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle * Donate money to environmental charities * Be careful who you vote for, pressure your representatives and politicans * Look into buying carbon emission offset (this is the only point on this list that I haven't researched yet, so I'm not sure)     I think out of those, eating meat, flying and driving are the worst offenders, but since there is 7 billion of us, everything matters.    A 2014 study into the real-life diets of British people estimates their greenhouse gas contributions (CO2eq) to be:  7.19 kg/day for high meat-eaters   3.81 kg/day for vegetarians   2.89 kg/day for vegans.   -[Dietary greenhouse gas emissions of meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1)

The United States and the rest of the developing world got a head start and were able to reap the rewards of their pollution earlier on, and later modernize and advance to reduce their emissions, and are now looking back on it as a regret. But developing nations are entering into that period now and would like the economic benefit industrialization brings along with it, pollution and all. After all Europe and the U.S. had their turn, fair's fair right? So the Climate Fund is supposed to incentivize these developing countries to make the switch earlier and forego the short term economic benefits in favor of long term.  "
73567	0	a	China and India, due to the fact that western nations industrialized earlier and thus have a larger total emissions, even those two countries have some of the highest currently. It was a concession to get them to sign on. 
73568	0	a	China and India are considered developing countries in the agreement, and thus they received a different set of rules. 
73569	0	a	Stepping out is a huge symbolic act for the US to take, and one that we will pay for dearly on the global stage. We are no longer in agreement talks to discuss climate change, so our interests will not be represented. Us stepping out sends the message that climate change is not a priority, which may result in other countries taking it less seriously. This could have drastic consequences for the *world* and everyone who inhabits it.  You can say it's meaningless if you think symbolic acts are meaningless. But of course we know that based on how humans make decisions, symbolic acts can be crucial.
73570	0	a	Well the first issue is we are one of the biggest contributors to it. The second is we have the infrastructure and money to invest in green energy, where it was a general concession that India and China were essentially catching up to becoming a superpower and severely limiting them right away would cripple them and cause more harm than good. 3 billion in U.S aid is a drop in the bucket, you know it and I know it, so is that really a good excuse.   At the end of the day, the U.S has been a leader for a lot of progress and change in the world. Is this something we want to take a backseat on because its not fair? Why does it need to be fair when its something that affects the whole world. Is that not essentially the U.S mantra? That we can shoulder a bigger load?   Do you honestly, and I'm being serious, do you honestly think that we aren't one of the biggest countries to have an impact on global warming in a negative way? Do you know how much energy we use? How inefficient our infrastructure is?  
73571	0	a	Agreed. Because of this post I trust r/science a little less to be unbiased
73572	0	a	"Take a look at [this figure](http://energiogklima.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fig_10AogBScience.png).    The top line projects continued emissions.  the second line projects moderate effort starting by 2030.  the third line shows if the current Paris pledges are met.  The fourth line shows an estimate with ""ratcheting,"" which is using the original pledges as a base, but further reducing emissions past the original pledges. This was the hope of the original deal.    So to answer your question, by 2025 things will likely be nearly the same as they are right now regardless. That's because Earth is a huge system and CO2 lasts a long time in the atmosphere, and we are committed to more warming before it gets better. However, that does not mean that the Paris Agreement is meaningless, as we need to be considering longer time scales, even if politicians generally don't.  Also, look at the probabilities on the right side of the figure. The only chance we have of staying under 2 degC is with the accord.

73573	0	a	"People seem to misunderstand what the Paris Climate Agreement is about.   In order to raise standards of living we need economic growth. In order for there to be economic growth, we need energy. Every product and service that has ever been sold required energy. Caring for the environment is expensive. Polluting is cheap. So we are looking for growth with environmental consciousness.   However, it's not that simple. The US has achieved a GDP per capita of 57k USD through cheap and polluting energy. It has gone past a manufacturing economy and into a service economy by massively contaminating the environment through cheap energy. In fact, the US is responsible for 27% of the emissions emitted from 1850 to 2011.   Now that we are at a crux and global warming effects are starting to affect everyone, we all know we need to do something. The US points at China saying it's the biggest pollutant. China points at the US saying it has achieved a GDP per capita 4x its own by contaminating the planet.   Why would China invest in being environmentally friendly when it can focus those resources into being competitive and bringing more people out of poverty? Why would it do so especially after the US didn't have to do it?  The US and developed countries increased their standards of living at the expense of the rest of the world. Now we want to cap everyone's emissions which won't give underdeveloped countries the opportunity of competitive growth through screwing the world as the developed countries did. So how do we deal with this?  1. We hold developed nations accountable by having them finance part (a very small part) of the expenses that underdeveloped countries will have to make in order to reduce emissions.  2. We allow underdeveloped countries to continue growing* as long as each consecutive dollar added to the GDP contaminates less than the last* (that's why China will still increase emissions until 2030, when they start to decrease). Instead of letting everyone run freely and screw the environment thinking ""we don't even make a difference"", we all commit to **progress**. 3. Developed countries start reducing emissions immediately, as they are not as concerned with survival of their poor and they have done the most damage of all.   What this does is set a relatively level playing field. We all suffer the expenses of going green which leads to no-one having an advantage. The arguments of ""cost"" it will bring to Americans don't make sense because every country will incur costs which will eliminate any disadvantage Americans would have.   Unfortunately I don't have total emissions in Tons of carbon, just percentage, but if we take the % of total cumulative emissions that a country has emitted and divide it by millions of current population, we see how developed countries have emitted much more per capita in order to get to where they are.   * US: 27%/325= 0.08% * European Union: 25%/510=0.05% * Russia: 8%/146=0.05% * Japan: 4%/126=0.03% * China: 11%/1,400= 0.008% * India: 3%/1,300= 0.002%  With these numbers we can see that for every person in China, each American has emitted 10x more carbon to reach 4x greater productivity. If we are to bring people to America's standard of living (which we should all be hoping for), it's unreasonable to ask countries to sacrifice that growth just because they are late to the game.   TL;DR The Paris Climate Agreement is based on achieving **sustainable development**. Developed countries have contributed most to the situation we're in, and will pitch in and make bigger sacrifices to help underdeveloped countries develop without too much sacrifice.   source: https://wri.org/blog/2014/11/6-graphs-explain-world%E2%80%99s-top-10-emitters "
73574	0	a	> virtue signal  The buzzwords that agenda-peddlers latch onto kind of fascinate me.
73575	0	a	"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/6/1/15725510/trump-pulls-us-out-of-paris-climate-deal  TL;DR: The Paris agreement, signed in 2015 by 195 countries, does four simple things.  1. It **sets a global goal of keeping global average temperatures from rising 2°C, or rising 3.6°F** (thanks /u/that_guy_next_to_you) (compared to temperatures pre-Industrial Revolution) by the end of the century.  2. It sets a non-binding agreement for countries to **reach peak greenhouse gas emissions “as soon as possible.""**  3. It **adds a framework for countries to become more aggressive in reaching those goals over time.** In 2020, delegates are supposed to reconvene and provide updates about their emission pledges, and report on how they’re becoming more aggressive on accomplishing the 2 degree goal.  4. It **asks richer countries to help out poorer countries:** to give them capital to invest in green technologies, but also to help them brace for a changing world.  &nbsp;  edit: 2nd source https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/the-paris-agreement-what-does-it-mean.xml  1. **The world as a whole agreed on a path forward.** 196 nations signed the Paris Agreement, the first time — since climate change rocketed to the top of the list of global issues — that the world has agreed on a path forward.  2. The Paris Agreement is a turning point. The agreement **“signals the turning point in the road to a low-carbon economy, a road paved by continued innovation in the technology, energy, finance, and conservation sectors,”** said Andrew Deutz, the Conservancy's director of international government relations.  3. The deal asks any nation signing it, of which there were 196, to **reduce greenhouse gas emissions** and to **regularly increase their ambitions**. The agreement requires that ratifying nations “peak” their greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and pursue the highest possible ambition that each country can achieve.  4. **Countries will aim to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and for the first time to pursue efforts to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees C.** The nations involved in COP 21 agreed upon and required that they would all work towards making sure the Earth’s temperature doesn’t rise above 2 degrees Celsius; this degree change is usually agreed upon as being the tipping point to preventing massive effects of climate change. (However, it should be noted that more recent science indicates a change of even 1 degree Celsius could cause major threats and impacts to coastal communities and developing nations.)  5. **The Paris Agreement has aspects that are binding, and aspects that are not.** Some elements of the agreement — such as requirements to report on progress towards lowering emissions — are binding. However, some elements are non-binding, such as the setting of emission-reduction targets.  &nbsp;  edit: important thing to note, http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2015/12/the_paris_agreement_won_t_punish_countries_that_fall_short_but_it_s_still.html  ""The big criticism of the landmark Paris climate deal is its **lack of enforcement mechanisms.** If India keeps burning coal like crazy, it won’t face fines or sanctions. Nobody is going to invade Nigeria if it fails to lower emissions. [...] But that doesn’t mean that the Paris Agreement, announced Saturday, is worthless. Because the process it lays out—in which individual countries make emissions commitments **and then reconvene every five years to measure progress and rich countries pledge $100 billion in aid to poorer countries**—taps into a few forces that can be almost as powerful as the threat of punishment. These include: **peer pressure, the desire to save face, the profit motive, and the dynamics of capitalism.** And they should leave us feeling very optimistic about Paris’ chances of helping nations—and perhaps more importantly, companies—make serious progress on cutting emissions."""
73576	0	a	I don't have numbers, but I can speak to the politics of it a bit. If you look into it you'll find a lot of things like that - that provide special circumstances for some countries, or support the development of other countries. This might seem unfair on the surface.  But really, this agreement isn't going to fix climate change. The point is to get the whole world to agree on a broad solution and cooperate. Even if their contribution is less than others, this is the first step towards an international dialogue. This is also why it's so amazing that nearly ever country on earth agreed to it. Pulling off diplomacy like that isn't easy or always 'fair', but it is important when you're trying to balance so many economic interests against one another. For example, a developing nation might want more time or more leeway to 'catch up' to the more powerful economies so that this humanitarian effort doesn't put them at a blatant economic disadvantage. If the world comes out ahead due to that, it's okay with me.  The Paris Agreement needs to go further, but opening this forum was a miraculous and unexpected step towards really tackling the issue. America's refusal to get involved has more impact on our international standing, than on the climate itself, I think.

73598	0	a	Awesome post.  To elaborate, think of fairness not as a flat tax, but as a progressive tax. Most people agree that flat taxes disproportionately affect the poor who don't have as much disposable/savable income and are already spending most of their money. Poor countries won't come to a climate discussion if they're told to cut emissions the same as the rich countries who profited crazy amounts by destroying the world's climate since the 1850s.   An across the board carbon reduction would kind of be like a flat tax. A more reasonable conversation that has a chance of bringing all parties to the table is a discussion about a more progressive carbon reduction system - where the countries who benefitted the most off polluting for the last 100 years and have already been developed for a long time need to reduce their emissions more. Because, in theory, they should have more resources at their disposal for reducing their emissions. China might have an insane amount of pollution, but they only relatively ramped up their industrialization and they have ~1.3 billion people. Poor countries won't come to the table and have a discussion if they're held to the same standards that profited off of destroying the planet's climate for the last 200 years.
73599	0	a	Didn't lots of countries agree to it because it doesn't affect them in any way and they are promising to do anything at all? I mean besides getting money from other countries.   I would think it would be easy to get every country to agree if you don't make most of them do anything except receive money from bigger countries like the US. 
73600	0	a	> This is also why it's so amazing that nearly ever country on earth agreed to it.  To be fair,   Is it really surprising that most countries, being net receivers of climate change funds under the Agreement, would be for it, whereas those bearing a disproportional amount of the cost (eg the US) might think twice?   Have people not wondered at all why countries like North Korea signed the agreement? It's a direct transfer of funds from US taxpayers to subsidize the development of green technology in other countries across the world, without any obligation on those countries to invest those funds in US produced greentech.
73601	0	a	This is what many fail to see. China's internal pressures to ease its obvious pollution problems are far greater than any international pressure.
73602	0	a	So why is the treaty necessary? The US is already trending downward due to natural gas. By the time that dries up, hopefully renewables will be more affordable. China is aiming to trend down due to smog.  Wouldn't a better battle be to fight governors, like Cuomo, who are shutting down nuclear plants and will probably have a large negative effect on the environment?

73605	0	a	Clothes too. This age of fast-fashion is havoc on the environment. Buy fewer, higher-quality (or used) clothes that will last. I don't have any statistics or anything but I can't imagine it is pleasant on the earth. Folks also sort of ignore the environmental impacts of using services like Amazon for things they truly do not need in two days (especially with Fresh and Now). This comes in the form of packaging waste and fuel/emissions etc.  I still have my guilty consumer items like bike stuff (which I justify by biking everywhere) but also LEGO but I know they're working on (and set goals for) developing a more eco-friendly plastic. 
73606	0	a	Livestock takes a lot of land, water and food to grow. It creates a lot of excrement and farts out methane, a very potent greenhouse gas.   In most simplest terms, imagine how many resources it takes to keep a whole animal alive for months to be able to get a few kilograms of meat from it.  Instead of that land that was used to grow food for livestock can now be used to grow food for people. 
73607	0	a	But that doesn't make them rich, they have an extremely poor GDP per capita compared to developed nations.
73608	0	a	ah, thank you. fixed the comment.
73609	0	a	This is actually a very sound geopolitical strategy. By investing in the stability of developing nations, the US can:  1. Keep entire regions stable and prevent extremist threats from taking root  2. Gain preferential access to booming markets in expanding economies  3. Gain valuable diplomatic points as a world leader in human rights, along with capturing the favor of countries that might otherwise lean towards the US's rivals  One of the best ways the US can defend itself is by making friends and keeping things from heating up, and investing in the development of poor nations is a very effective way to do it.   On the other side, the US stands to fall behind China, India, and Europe as they forge ahead with green technology. Job markets with lasting power are being created, and the USA has the skilled workforce, financial systems, and manufacturing capacity to lead the world into a climate-friendly future. By leaving the Paris agreement they're giving all that up to other countries, and stand to suffer in the long term.
73610	0	a	"And we're not just talking ""oh, the air is kind of dirty, we should do something about it."" We're talking about smog so bad you can't see the next block. There has been a booming industry in some Chinese urban centers to build enclosures for yards to turn them into indoor spaces so that the kids can go ""outside"" to play. The air quality in China's biggest cities is a severe public health issue. "
73611	0	a	Purely anecdotal but when I lived in China for a while, I noticed that there was a genuine despair surrounding the air pollution; it's really bad there. In the month that I was there, I would regularly clean my nose out with tissue and find black soot(?) in there. Discussions with colleagues, I noticed that it was the norm and that people left their air purifiers on 24/7. The thing is, in China, the regular folk are suffering now. Air pollution is not a fallacy, but something they live through every day which costs them a lot financially to manage.
73612	0	a	The reason for the agreement is to hold developed nations to a particular standard. Right now going green is disincentivised by short term increases in production costs, which leads to short term losses in international trade. Holding all western countries to the same standard reduces this disparity and decreases the consequences of being an early adopter. 
73613	0	a	Per capita is entirely relevant when individual contribution to emissions is non-trivial.
73614	0	a	I mean, that's not something they can realistically change overnight.   But their moves to shut down coal plants, kill plans for new ones, and push much harder for renewables shows that they don't want to be the top polluter forever.   Them being the biggest polluter doesn't excuse the US, nor does it invalidate China's efforts.

73621	0	a	I studied abroad in Beijing, and was told I can't spend more than 3 hours outside consecutively without it negatively affecting my lungs since I was not from the area and not used to the smog. That was as a 21 year old college student. Imagine a 2 year old's lungs in those air conditions.
73622	0	a	But the agreement isn't holding developed nations to any particular standard.  In part, it's self-defined standards.  In effect, the non-binding nature and lack of oversight makes hitting even your self-defined standards lacking.
73623	0	a	China is still a developing country. There are many people still in slums who have not yet moved on to the expanding middle class. China is at a significant disadvantage already by having to develop under the scrutiny of the world regarding their climate impact - something the US and Europe didn't have to deal with while developing during the industrial revolution.   While currently the US and Europe have lower carbon emission level, you need to consider the fact that over their history they have been *far* worse offenders. Countries which are already developed used coal and other highly polluting energy sources during their development. The idea of having developed countries pay for the development of third world countries is to allow them to bypass the stepping stone that are fossil fuels.   While you may think a world superpower like China isn't a developing country it still is considered one. India and China have a very quickly growing middle class but many people haven't joined it yet. People are still living in slums. By having them not pay for the development of other countries they can invest in the advancement of their own renewable energy sources - something they are already doing.

Participants, N = 379, completed the Personality Inventory (5th ed.; PID-5), Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM), and music and movie preferences questionnaires. The structure of some, but not all, music preferences factors aligned with previous reports. Overall, maladaptive traits had meaningful, albeit modest links to entertainment media preferences, but not to the kinds of intense or rebellious music genres sometimes labeled as “problem” entertainment in prior literature. Support emerged for several a priori hypotheses, but some predictions based on the three- and five-factor normal personality trait and entertainment preferences literature did not generalize to a five-factor formulation of maladaptive personality. We discuss the findings’ implications and several likely sources of inconsistencies in the literature on music and movie preferences and personality.

If you search the title of a paper on Google Scholar, often it will give you a link to a non-pay walled copy in addition to the pay walled journal copy (e.g. Some fields post preprints to the arXiv, which is non-paywalled, and Google Scholar is smart enough to find those). If that doesn't work, searching the title on regular Google will often turn up a copy on the lead author's own website or their institution's website. Finally, if neither of those work, if you email the corresponding author (which author is the corresponding author is usually noted on the pay walled site on the 'free' splash page where you can see the abstract and author list) and ask nicely, most authors will give you a copy. Authors want as many people as possible to read their work. It's only the journal that wants you to think you have to pay.

For another, 400 people is a fantastic sample size. Assuming no obvious issues with the sampling process, a sample that large requires essentially 0 finesse to work with.

73645	0	a	Anti-vax beliefs have torn my family apart.  My wife is currently pregnant and is due in 2 weeks. Our first kid. Her sister and her kids are coming down from out of country to visit the family basically 1 week after the child is born. It’s very important that her sister and kids come because she has had an incredibly difficult two years. My wife’s mom absolutely adores and loves the two grandkids more than anything, and we do as well.   The problem is that her sister is an antivaxxer and her kids are not vaccinated. A long story short, we had to move into my wife’s mother’s house and decided to have the baby there. The intent was for my wife’s sister to stay in the same house. I only remembered that the kids were not vaccinated a day after I booked the tickets.   We are now forced to move to my sisters house and we are not seeing my wife’s family for Christmas/the month duration that her sister is here and it is tearing the family apart. It’s really hurting my wife because she’s nesting hard and is now forced out of her bubble she made.   Her sister believes that we are buying into “fear mongering” and that she thinks we think her children are “dirty”. That is not the truth at all as we love the kids so much as they grew up with us.  I would have never imagined that vaccination beliefs are this polarizing.

Where were those people located? Were they all from the same nation/group/culture/neighborhood? Did you ask people from other areas? Did you ask loaded questions that can't be answered in 1 word?   If a Mormon church funds an abortion study whose questions were written by an anti-abortion think tank, and they interviewed 40 women in Salt Lake City, what do you think the outcome of that study is going to be?

73649	0	a	I think that would be extremely difficult. If I am not mistaken, you would need to be an injured party, so maybe you had a child who could not be vaccinated for some medical reason who became infected due to an anti-vaxxer. You would then need to prove that the anti-vaxxer was influenced by the ads. The alternative is to be a reformed anti-vaxxer that says these lies are what convinced you, and that your could became infected with a preventable disease. Either way, I don't think it would be easy.

As such, they are proud to declare that they have never suffered any sort of disastrous business failure, and the reportedly massive amounts of money lost on building waterfront facilities in a desert are fabrications of our collective consciousness... They also said that if you happen to stumble on the Waterfront buildings out in the desert exactly where you remembered them, and they seem completely real, standing as vacant and useless as the day they were built, that’s because you are still hallucinating and should seek medical treatment immediately.

It’s much easier to blame someone else for your kid getting sick or dying, than it is to take responsibility for your mistake or just accept that sometimes life is unfair.

The proteins belong to more than 4,000 new biological families predicted to be involved in, among other processes, the warfare waged among different bacterial strains as they vie for primacy in coveted biological niches, the cell-to-cell communication between microbes and their unwitting hosts, and the critical day-to-day housekeeping duties that keep the bacteria happy and healthy.    > Because they are so small — fewer than 50 amino acids in length — it’s likely the proteins fold into unique shapes that represent previously unidentified biological building blocks.

To systematically identify small proteins, we carried out a comparative genomics study on 1,773 human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites. We describe >4,000 conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ∼30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain and almost half are not represented in reference genomes. We identify putative housekeeping, mammalian-specific, defense-related, and protein families that are likely to be horizontally transferred. We provide evidence of transcription and translation for a subset of these families. Our study suggests that small proteins are highly abundant and those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported.

We have been having troubles translating our findings to humans (from mouse models) though, as there is an unimaginable amount of ""things"" going on in the gut, and as the host gets bigger, stuff gets harder.  I have also read of labs trying to engineer particular viruses to affect the gut biome. So instead of ""increasing"" a particular bacteria within the gut, these viruses would decrease a particular bacteria.   Hopefully in the future we could find a way to increase of decrease the biome to help people but as EVERYONE is VERY different, in terms of gut microbiome, it is very hard. My genetics may be very similar to my brother, but my gut microbiome may as well be from someone from a whole different lineage than his, there's no cookie-cutter ideal biome, by any means."

We have no clue exactly what bacteria or compounds they might be producing you need, so here's everything from a healthy donor.  It's definitely a carpet bombing approach, but it's really all we have right now.
73685	0	a	"As someone who has undergone an FMT and spoken to researchers in the field, some of the difficulties is that some donors and hosts aren't ""compatible"" in the sense that a donor may not have the things you need.  So even though FMT can work, at the moment the best we can do is to just try a bunch of donor and host combinations until you find one that works for what you were trying to fix. Then, there is also interplay with our immune system which might kill bacteria from the host and make the hosts microbiome unstable in your own gut.  I think the best way to explain it is that we are all genetically humans, but our DNA differs in ways that make us all different and unique. The microbiome is similarly complex and just as important a part of our body as DNA as we are slowly discovering, but we know almost nothing about it."

Your parents having a friend who can get you a job filing papers in an office in high school, instead of flipping burgers, is invaluable.

Attending the best private schools, not having to worry about affording college, your parents business connections and actually having successful parents who can lead you in a successful direction is a huge leg up.   Going to a poor public school and not having anyone in your life that can help find a path to a successful future is basically a life sentence to being lower middle class or worse.   I grew up in a weird area where there was a mix of lower middle and upper middle class families and most all of the upper middle class kids are successful college educated 30 somethings while my lower class friends aren’t.   Both groups had a fair amount of intelligent kids, but without the means to afford it and understanding of the importance of tertiary education many aren’t achieving their full potential.

Journal Reference:  Gene discovery and polygenic prediction from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in 1.1 million individuals  James J. Lee, Robbee Wedow, […]David Cesarini   Nature Genetics, volume 50, pages1112–1121 (2018)   DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0147-3  Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0147-3  Abstract  Here we conducted a large-scale genetic association analysis of educational attainment in a sample of approximately 1.1 million individuals and identify 1,271 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs. For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11–13% of the variance in educational attainment and 7–10% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research.

73700	0	a	The people who deny the importance of being born into wealth are often people who were born into wealth. The children of rich parents are born into a social safety net. When their children try, make mistakes, screw up, they don't have to worry about being homeless or dying over a minor health issue that can be managed well with proper preventative medicine.  To me, it's a huge argument as to why all societies need a basic safety net. It's a farce anyone gets anything done or reaches any success all by themselves and without the help of anyone. *-aword
73701	0	a	I think by far the biggest and best way to get connections for those kinds of things is through a very good college. Ivy league and other high end schools can easily set you up with some pretty insane jobs starting very early. It's easy to get a job when companies are actively searching for and stalking you to try and get you to work for them.
73702	0	a	"Environment also has a lot to do with it.  Born into a rich family? Chances are pretty good that your parents both have at least a bachelor's. Having done it themselves, they'll expect you to achieve likewise. I grew up upper middle class, and both my parents went to college. So from an early age I expected to go to college after high school, it was just the ""right"" path.  But born into a poor family? Your parents may not have ever been to college. You grow up without feeling the pressure of needing to attend college, since your parents are able to survive without it.  Note that the study measures ""gifted"" by *genetics*, not actual achievement. That seems a little hand wavy to me but it definitely makes even more sense as far as low income people not graduating college because the study doesn't consider low income people who have actually demonstrated talent."

73708	0	a	I would like to add that kids of high-income parents are exposed to many things in their youth that kinds of low-income parents arent. Such as books, trips to museums or far-away countries, perhaps also help with homework. Nowadays if a kid does not do well in school you can just pay for a tutor.
73709	0	a	Yep. I don't remember the exact place but I recall a post in r/TIL that detailed a massively expensive school in Europe to which the obscenely wealthy often send their children.

The rich kids usually have private tutors, they are sometimes home schooled and will even skip a few grades, entering university much sooner (A few of the seniors in my engineering courses are 13-14 years old). They get special privileges from their parents donating money to the university. They can afford to take on school projects and be more successful than people from other universities that don't have the resources/money. They can get their foot in the door of many places through their parents connections. They don't have to work so they can spend more time on studies and are less stressed out. They can afford to live by their selves on/near campus rather than live with their parents and spend an hour or two driving to classes every day. They can afford to eat expensive, more nutritious meals everyday. They generally have more free time and can afford to sleep a healthy amount (most of the poorer students I know sleep 5 or less hours). They can afford to drive rather than spend a bunch of time on the city bus. They can afford to take all their classes on time (rather than take some while working) and graduate on time. They can afford to go to graduate school. Just some of the things I've noticed.

Even so, when I ate out, which was maybe a couple of times per week, at least half the time it was the dollar menu.  My parents enjoy talking about how when they were first married and completely broke, they ate hotdogs on sandwich bread because it was cheaper than hotdog buns. Going out to eat wasn't even on their radar.  It's funny how different people think about money and belt-tightening.

73732	0	a	Anyone interested in the subject of introversion should read *Quiet: The Power of Introverts* by Susan Cain. It's a great book and can explain a lot for both an extrovert or an introvert who feels unhappy about the extrovert status quo.   Anyway, big thing to take away is that extro-introversion happens on a spectrum, not every introvert is 100% on the introvert scale, likewise for extroverts. People don't seem to understand that introverts can be party animals or gregarious like any extrovert. What happens often is that people assume a lot about introverts, when they really have no idea.
73733	0	a	Pardon me if I'm having a knee-jerk reaction here but the article doesn't seem to adequately explain what they consider as 'Eastern culture' that presumably values introversion.   Eastern culture as I've grown up with is all about social activities. You do *everything* together or else you're an antisocial weirdo. You stay back after work 'voluntarily' because your boss hasn't left yet. You go to drink with your boss and your colleagues until your face falls off, attending to their every whim and gesture.   This is not a kind society to introverts or people who find solitude to be a welcome company. 
73734	0	a	"I have a hard time with this article because it paints a very limited image of introverts and extroverts as well as behaviour indication someone to be one. And while the cultural aspect is raised the author still relies on western interpretations on how to categorise behaviour as extraverted or introverted:   > Indeed, being extraverted can get you in trouble if you’re traveling in a country or culture that regards such outwardly-focused behavior as brash and impolite.   The point is that in those cultures the behaviour isn't considered an expression of extraversion because thats not how extraverted people in those cultures express their pro social attitude - they are *as* extraverted as other extroverts in other cultures but use different outlets. North American extravertive behaviour patterns are not the ""default"" or ""normal"" way of extravertive behaviour (Even french introverts kiss their relatives on both cheeks while the most outgoing japanese person would be a little disturbed by that) but the whole article uses examples tailored around that point of view.   >  the ideal person in the “individualistic West” is “autonomous, expressive, and comfortable in the spotlight” (p. 2).   save for the ""comfortable in the spotlight"" part introverted people are perfectly autonomous and they can easily be expressive. Introversion does not necessarily mean people don't express their feelings or individuality - not speaking when you don't feel like you have anything to say is an expression of feeling in of itself and it's not right to talk about introverts being quiet in public as a perpetual state of ""wanting so say something"". They are not autists with social deficiencies.   One one hand I'm perfectly okay with the conclusion that ""being yourself"" will lead to more happiness and increase your chances of social acceptance but on the other I think the author fails to show that introverts already possess many of the qualities valued in modern society and tend to sabotage themselves with anxieties from aspiring to behaviour they experience as unpleasant *because*, like the author, confuse being socially able with being extraverted.    "
73735	0	a	This issue isn’t accepting/valuing oneself as an introvert, it’s everyone else’s for not respecting your introversion and your needs. Edit: it can and probably is both. I meant the biggest issue for me personally is others constantly nagging you to be extroverted.
73736	0	a	I think this Western value of extroversion extends past just our intellectual/emotional acceptance of ourselves. Being introverted has actual real-world consequences out in the workplace and other areas of life. I have no numbers to back it up, but I would think that introverts are less likely to be satisfied in their relationships (or lack of relationships if single) because they may not be able to voice their frustrations as easily or have a much harder time approaching potential mates than their extroverted peers. In the workplace, being introverted probably gets quite a few people passed over for promotions because their extroverted co-workers are more likely to get noticed.  Not talking is taken as a sign of lack of engagement, disinterest, or just a lack of ideas. I can sit in a class and listen to everything that's said by everybody and absorb it all in, but if there's a participation requirement in that class, if I don't speak up I'll get docked points for just not talking. There's constant pressure to speak your mind in our society, just being a good listener is not enough.

73739	0	a	Also the stereotypical idea that introversion and social anxiety are the same thing. I recently stumbled upon a video by Psych2Go in the vein of 'x things only introverts can relate to'. Pretty much all of the named things had more to do with anxiety than introversion. It bothered me a lot.  I am both introverted and extroverted, but when you see it on a spectrum I feel more comfortable close to the middle than being hardcore introverted. I love being outgoing and sociable. I like to go to a party every once in a while. But I also love being with just one or two close friends the majority of the time. Or I prefer commuting alone on the train than with someone from my class that I'm friendly with but actually barely know. My anxiety is a whole different issue laid on top of this and it applies to both my introverted and my extroverted side. I'm afraid to pick up the phone not because I'm introverted but because I'm anxious. It's something else
73740	0	a	It's because it's a bunch of eastern festishization. All human society favors people who are outgoing. If you're nice and happy and make friends with whoever you meet than you will be more successful regardless of what culture you're in.  I've never been to Japan, but I've heard they don't like people being loud on trains. That doesn't mean they don't like extroversion, it just means they don't like people being loud on trains. There are plenty of Americans who don't like people being loud on trains, but our culture has generally decided that you have to get the fuck over it if people are loud. It has nothing to do with us not preferring introverts. 
73741	0	a	Furthermore, there is nothing that indicates introverts are less comfortable in the spotlight. There are tons of celebrities who are extremely introverted in private life, yet love the stage. There is simply no correlation. The only difference between an introvert and an extrovert is that one loses energy by communicating with others, and the other gains energy.
73742	0	a	Surely it can be both.   I see an extrovert, wish I was extroverted and become discontent.   An extrovert observes my behavior and demeans me for being introverted.  
73743	0	a	Best definition I've seen: Introverts need alone time to relax and regain energy levels.   As opposed to extroverts who become energized by interacting with other people.   My husband and his mom are perfect examples of each. My husband will lock himself in a room alone and just read or play single player games to relax. His mom will pick up the phone and call every single person on her list and chat when she wants to relax.

Being an introvert doesn't mean you are shy, socially awkward, anxiety ridden, etc., it just means you get drained of energy to the point where you just can't be around people. When people meet up for after work drinks, you can't go because you need to be alone, and not because you have anxiety or are socially awkward. "

73750	0	a	This study is not very reliable.  It’s conducted on a few dozen university students—so there is no real control for culture or age.  And it’s just based on word associations.  Another way to think about death and biology is that we are extremely hardwired to think about death—every biological response we have is built around avoiding death. Also there are lots of cultures around the world that dwell on death in iconography and religious contexts.  The narrow sample size of this study predicted its outcome.
73751	0	a	Warning: this story is about death. You might want to click away now.  That’s because, researchers say, our brains do their best to keep us from dwelling on our inevitable demise. A study found that the brain shields us from existential fear by categorising death as an unfortunate event that only befalls other people.  The brain does not accept that death is related to us,” said Yair Dor-Ziderman, at Bar Ilan University in Israel. “We have this primal mechanism that means when the brain gets information that links self to death, something tells us it’s not reliable, so we shouldn’t believe it.”    Being shielded from thoughts of our future death could be crucial for us to live in the present. The protection may switch on in early life as our minds develop and we realise death comes to us all.  “The moment you have this ability to look into your own future, you realise that at some point you’re going to die and there’s nothing you can do about it,” said Dor-Ziderman. “That goes against the grain of our whole biology, which is helping us to stay alive.”  To investigate how the brain handles thoughts of death, Dor-Ziderman and colleagues developed a test that involved producing signals of surprise in the brain  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811919306688

I'm 37 now and it was getting worse until I took some psychedelics and it calmed right down. Actually a lot of things changed for the better after that.  Anyway, if what everyone is saying is true about their sample size and age distribution, there's an obvious bias in their sample and should be revaluated.

Low SES violent neighbourhood = lots of death; large familial/tribal groupings = lots of exposure to death etc.   I’d go so far as to argue that most people in the world have a very different set of life experiences regarding death than do those studies in the article.

The other roomate myself and the other guy who died shared a house with is probably not going to be around much longer and none of us are that old. It actually started in high school when you'd hear about someone dying not long after graduation.

Solar farms with grass or foliage cover show less signs of degradation than ones with gravel.  This is due to the albedo (reflected radiation) of the ground cover.  Foliage has a much lower albedo than gravel so less radiation is reflected and less damage is observed.

We investigate a novel approach to solve this problem by creating a hybrid of colocated agriculture and solar photovoltaic (PV) infrastructure. We take an integrative approach—monitoring microclimatic conditions, PV panel temperature, soil moisture and irrigation water use, plant ecophysiological function and plant biomass production within this ‘agrivoltaics’ ecosystem and in traditional PV installations and agricultural settings to quantify trade-offs. We find that shading by the PV panels provides multiple additive and synergistic benefits, including reduced plant drought stress, greater food production and reduced PV panel heat stress. The results presented here provide a foundation and motivation for future explorations towards the resilience of food and energy systems under the future projected increased environmental stress involving heat and drought.

When you have tons of metal support beams in your field it's going to block combines, even in arid areas. I mean sure new machines could be developed. But then farmers have to buy new expenaive machines and learn how to fix them on their own. Mass production farming just isn't viable with the solar panels in the way, even with the extra positives of less water use and so on. However, perhaps solar panels and cattle farms can work together providing cows shade and lessening coal plant emissions (cause solar) seeing as cattle aren't going anywhere anytime soon.

Intentional plant design with proper equipment selection would only make it easier. As an aside, cows are a big problem since they like to rub on anything they can mosey up to, thus breaking panels. Goats climb the panels and break them too. The best common grazing animals for solar are sheep; we've had no issues with them. Putting the panels higher greatly increases costs due to wind loads and the increased pile sizes required. Not to mention visual impacts as well... So, I don't think you will see all farms convert to solar plus ""tomatos"" or something, but the benefits are there.

Experimental Design:   Fifteen patients enrolled on this 'window of opportunity' phase 1 study, exposing primary bladder cancers to CAVATAK prior to surgery. The first nine patients received intravesical administration of monotherapy CAVATAK; in the second stage, six patients received CAVATAK with a sub-therapeutic dose of mitomycinC, known to enhance expression of ICAM-1 on bladder cancer cells. The primary endpoint was to determine patient safety and maximum tolerated dose. Secondary endpoints were evidence of viral replication, induction of inflammatory cytokines, anti-tumour activity and viral-induced changes in resected tissue.   Results:   Clinical activity of CAVATAK was demonstrated by induction of tumour inflammation and haemorrhage following either single or multiple administrations of CAVATAK in multiple patients, and a complete resolution of tumour in one patient. Whether used alone or in combination with mitomycinC, CAVATAK caused marked inflammatory changes within NMIBC tissue biopsies by up-regulating interferon-inducible genes including both immune checkpoint-inhibitory genes (PD-L1 and LAG3) and Th1-associated chemokines as well as induction of the innate activator RIG-I, compared to bladder cancer tissue from untreated patients. No significant toxicities were reported in any patient, from either virus or combination therapy.   Conclusions:   The acceptable safety profile of CAVATAK, proof of viral targeting, replication and tumour cell death together with the virus-mediated increases in ""immunological heat"" within the tumour microenvironment all indicate that CAVATAK may be potentially considered as a novel therapeutic for NMIBC."

According to the article, men are on average ~8.2% more likely to swipe right on a highly educated partner. Maybe the effect is fairly small (compared to over 90% increase for women), because fewer men read the bio or care about it, but generalising beyond that is just lazy stereotyping.

Abstract:   In this study, we examine the impact of an individual's education level on her/his mating success on the mobile dating app Tinder. To do so, we conducted a field experiment on Tinder in which we collected data on 3,600 profile evaluations. In line with previous research on mating preferences from multiple fields, our results indicate a heterogeneous effect of education level by gender: while women strongly prefer a highly educated potential partner, this hypothesis is rejected for men. In contrast with recent influential studies from the field of economics, we do not find any evidence that men would have an aversion to a highly educated potential partner. Additionally, in contrast with most previous research – again from multiple fields – we do not find any evidence for preferences for educational assortative mating, i.e. preferring a partner with a similar education level.

73803	0	a	So this study comes with a lot of caveats. This was in Belgium and based off of 24 fake profiles. Their 4 types of education were two types of bachelor's degrees and two types of master's degrees. Not to mention:  >[They] refrained from using non-higher education degrees for [their] profiles, as then it may have been unclear for the subjects of [thier] study that that degree was the highest education level [their] profiles attained.   Which basically means the participants either had a choice of bachelor's or master's degrees, which isn't a great way to conclude that,  >Men on Tinder do not appear to be intimidated by highly educated women  The authors even say that,  >the effect of education level identified in our study may (partly) be due to the signal of a higher earnings potential that often coincides with a higher education level (supra, Section 2.1). We therefore interpret our results as the total effect of education level, i.e. encompassing also higher earnings potential, instead of as the direct effect of education level – as examined by Ong (2016) – which for example could be due to a preference for an enlightened conversation or a desire to go on sophisticated dates.

The women I’ve talked to are much more picky, but that’s because _every time they swipe right it’s a match_. If both men and women filtered equally then maybe this wouldn’t be an issue, but men are dragging a net, while women are spear fishing.   I do wonder how this research has affected the results/behavior of the participants.

Using Tinder I came to a few realisations (observations may vary, in different countries):  1) Many users still maintain their high standards. Even though it is appearent they've been on the plattform for a long time (e.g. a sort of bitterness in profiles, weird laundry lists,...)  2) Some seem to be oblivious to the fact that maybe it is their own mentality/expectations that is the problem.  3) Way to many women appear to not be there to actually meet men. Just there for validation/promoting their IG Profile.  4) About 2/3 are just boring and expect you to keep the initial conversation alive. Related to 2)  I get it. Women are being swarmed with potential men and therefor have many options. But still: Where I'm from, it seems to be the bottom of the barrel of the dating market. After 6 months I'm done and decided to take my chances meeting someone in the real world, you know....where you actually meet...normal people. I think if you are really attractive you can have a lot of fun with random hookups but in terms of finding a relationship you might aswell take your chances in the real world.

73815	0	a	You're ignoring that this problem begins before graduating highschool. From kindergarten onwards, males struggle despite doing well on standardized tests. Some studies have found teacher bias that disappears when they don't know the gender of the student, and others have found that boys are punished more severely for similar misbehavior as girls, and that this increase in severity precisely mirrors the increase in severity adult men receive in the legal system compared to women for similar crimes.  As an aside, I also resent the glorification of trades and blue collar labor. I'm a first generation college student **because** my whole family goes into trades and I don't know a single man still working his trade after 60. They all cripple themselves at some point. Years of crawling under car engines, or years of welding, or years of running a lathe all contribute to joint problems, back problems, lung problems from inhaled contaminants, and then there are more severe injuries like falls from ladders, electric shocks, saws kicking back, etc etc etc.  You use the worst case scenario for a grad student and compare it to the best case scenario for a young blue collar worker. But you're ignoring that a guy could get a bachelor's degree in a STEM field for free if he did better in high school and start out making $80k/year with no debt in a field that won't destroy his body, that he can do until he retires. A guy who doesn't score a free ride scholarship can still attain that for $20k-60k in debt over 4 years, which he can then pay off in 20 months or so.

73824	0	a	Of course they did! That show broke every single rule about how to talk about suicide. It sort of gave a half baked effort at showing how suicide is bad, but then it went on to glorify suicide in every way possible. Let's look at the ways how it did that:  1. It showed the main girl who committed suicide as being present (through memories and the tapes) for weeks and months after she died. Teens don't understand yet that death is permanent and this show reinforces that.   2. It put ALL the blame on the bullies. Counselors everywhere stress taking control of your own life, your own emotions, and your own reactions to other people, and this show does its darnedest to unravel any idea of personal agency. It shows that the girl that committed suicide was a complete victim and suicide was her only option, which is exactly the opposite of what you should do if you want people to avoid suicide.   3. It shows that the girl who committed suicide got literally everything she wanted. Attention from everyone in the school, all the bullies feeling bad, and even her crush falling in love with her after the fact because of the tapes she made.  4. It shows the actual gruesome way she committed suicide, giving everyone who was wondering how to do it step-by-step directions.  And those are just a few. It breaks every single guideline on how journalists should talk about suicide and it encourages self-destructive thinking beyond belief. I'm surprised this headline is even news. Of course this show encourages suicide.

I realize that, as the article notes, there is ""a well-established link between suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts,"" so I think we're right to be concerned about this.   But it's also worth noting the increases in google searches for suicide hotlines and suicide prevention. If we're trying to evaluate the net negative/positive effect of the show, it's worth digging into the actual frequency with which people google these terms rather than percentage increase (you can see these numbers in Figure C in the research article).   For example, the fact that searches for ""how to kill yourself"" went up by 9% sound bad, right? However, in the article, it notes that searches for ""suicide hotline number"" went up 21% (this is not noted in the fatherly.com article; instead, they note that searches for ""suicide hotlines"" went up by 12%. From Figure C in the research article, it is clear that searches for ""suicide hotline number"" are more than twice as frequent as searches for ""how to kill yourself."" How many people who might have attempted suicide did not because they contact a suicide hotline because they saw the show? Any honest appraisal of the impact on this show would attempt to address this.   While the evidence for suicide contagion (the Werther Effect) is robust, not talking about suicide further stigmatizes and isolates those who are suffering. I realize there are guidelines for stories about suicide, but when you're writing fiction, it's hard to make a show that people will watch that doesn't feel like a PSA (and if no one watches, it has no impact).   Finally, the fact that the lead author says ""the time for debate is over"" and that the show ""totally misses the mark"" when the results of his study provide plenty of evidence that the show has some positive effect that might have mitigated the negative effect doesn't cause me to have much faith in his work.   **UPDATE:** As someone drew to my attention, the Y axis on the figure in the article is NOT frequency of searches. If we don't have that info, it's hard to say whether the show had a positive or negative overall effect on suicide attempts/prevention. "
73831	0	a	I'm a psychology grad student with a focus on clinical, and when I've pointed these facts out, I've often been met with disagreement and a negative response. On Youtube and the like, many commentators have acknowledged that professionals are mostly highly critical of this show, but concluded they were wrong because it 'started a conversation' or some such.  Somehow, I doubt they would have disagreed with the opinion of, say, cardiologists about a heart issue. This trend of disregarding science about mental health needs to stop. 
73832	0	a	Honestly one of the biggest faults is that it is essentially claiming someone can stop their friend/loved ones from doing it just by intervening in a bad event. Whether or not it sometimes is the case, it puts the onus/responsibility on the surviving loved ones in a very means-well way that backfires IMO. Sometimes there really *isn't* anything you can do except try to be there for someone - a single moment is not always the difference between life and death, and sometimes we are just simply powerless to help. 
73833	0	a	"> Susceptible people include all depressed and suicidal people, as well as people who ""are like"" the deceased (gender, age, circumstance).  I don't think people understand this. They made it out to be that this is a teenage problem. It is, but it's an everyone problem. If you had anxiety or depression when you were a kid, chances are much higher of having it as an adult:  https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/older-adults-and-depression/index.shtml  The show was off-message, and I get that it was about and targeted at teens, but adult me had a really hard time a while after watching the show.  That said, I will protect free speech to the end, I just don't think this show was particularly responsible given how serious a message it was supposed to be sending."
73834	0	a	I have a friend who is a Psch (PTSD though) who told me he had discussed it with his colleagues about whether there was anything to gain from watching the show with parents/guardians and having the option to discuss the subjects brought forward with the show. Most thought that the risks outweighed any benefits.
73835	0	a	"I think it was one of Malcolm Gladwell's books (I know he's controversial as an author), but he claims that suicide rates go up as soon as an ""influencer"" goes through with it.  Part of his evidence is based on a small island with a small population that had suicide rates go up with almost no real ""outside"" source to blame.  The theory goes that as soon as one person does it, others, somehow gain the ""permission"" to try it, while their personal reasons are just the foundation for leaning into the act.  With Chris Cornell, Linkin Park's Chester Bennington, and this show out this year, I hope it doesn't spike up suicide rates.  It really does leave a gap in people's lives."

73842	0	a	I do have to wonder if it was suicidal kids that opted to open up because of the show... or was it kids needing attention?    As a teen I suffered from depression.  I slit my wrist (hurt like hell) and told the Doctor I was peeling an orange and slipped.  He bought it and sent me home.  I did drugs and alcohol and cutting to try to feel something and to feel nothing.  I was lucky.  I found a guy who saw through me.  After taking pills one night he got me to the hospital where they got me anti-depressants and therapy.  Married 19 years next month with 2 lovely girls.    I'm so happy there was someone there for me.

73846	0	a	Suicide contagion is actually one of the reasons that I routinely advise parents and patients that I do not want them admitted to the hospital unit. I reserve hospitalization for people who have treatment needs that require hospitalization, not simply suicidal risk.
73847	0	a	It's frustrating, I think part of this stems from the fact that everyone likes to think that they know something about human behavior, and they understand how and why people and society works the way they do. Because of this they don't view experts in the field of mental health as having access to a knowledge base that is totally unique from their own, though they would have no problem saying the cardiologist is an expert in something they know little about.  
73848	0	a	Totally agree. The implication that, in any world, people should be held *responsible* for someone's suicide, simply because they didn't see it coming or were insensitive in a moment or generally didn't behave 100% correctly somehow, is appalling to me. I'm all for being a conscious friend and I'm all for helping a suicidal or depressed friend as much as you can... but you can't take on their life and their pain as your own.
73849	0	a	"I think it's more that the link can sometimes go completely against intuition.   those complaining about the series complain that it ""glorifies suicide"" and it inevitably turns into an argument about whether it actually does but that may be entirely irrelevant.   The data from older research seems to suggest that even if this had been a series that in no way glorified suicide and instead was simply a long montage of people saying ""don't do it, suicide is not the answer"" that was watched by a similar number of people then suicide rates may have still increased similarly.   Sometimes ""breaking the stigma"" and ""starting a conversation"" on a topic can literally cost lives because talking about it makes more people think about it and more people thinking about it can lead to more people actually committing suicide.   People get similarly upset about anti-intuitive things like how after disasters it's actually better to not immediately put people into counselling:  after some disasters where that was tried like the King's Cross fire of 1987 the outcomes were much worse, possibly because sometimes people need some time *not* talking about traumatic things to counsellors and throwing someone straight into counselling can be an awful thing to do and leave people much worse off. "
73850	0	a	>Also searches dropped down to normal after like 2 weeks.   That may be good or bad. 🤔
73851	0	a	It's possibly because someone who wants to commit suicide maybe searching all those things, but people who want to help someone, or just wants to be educated is likely not seaching the how to's.  The research is likely under the assumption that only suicidal people would search how to, so that is the pertinent data.   I'm not saying that is correct, maybe that is why it's not addressed. Though to be a thorough research article, it should address it, otherwise it just looks like they are pushing an agenda.

73863	0	a	An experimental cancer vaccine that boosts the immune system’s ability to fight cancers could work in tandem with other cancer therapies to fight aggressive tumours, scientists have reported.  The researchers demonstrated that adding a molecule called Diprovocim to a vaccine can draw cancer-fighting cells to tumour sites. Their experiments in mice with melanoma suggest these vaccines could increase chances of recovery in cases where a drug therapy alone is not working.  “This co-therapy produced a complete response–a curative response–in the treatment of melanoma,” says Scripps Research Professor Dr Dale Boger, who co-led the study with Nobel laureate Bruce Beutler, of UT Southwestern.    https://www.drugtargetreview.com/news/35232/anti-pd-l1-cancer-vaccine/  Study http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/08/22/1809232115
73864	0	a	"I'm always cautious when I read threads like this because **cancer is not a single disease**, and the phrase ""cancer vaccine"" can be misleading if this isn't kept in mind.  Although this is exceptionally good news, results here target   > a form of notoriously aggressive melanoma.   The model could be promising for the many other types of cancer including other forms of melanoma, and I really hope it does, but this research targets just one so far."
73865	0	a	Ok, so here is the rub, and this is why it probably won't actually work to this extent in humans. The cancer model they used is an Ova model. One of the primary problems with generating a cancer vaccine is the vaccine has to target some sort of protein so that the immune system that is primed by the vaccine can attack that protein and whatever cell is harboring it. This is very difficult in cancer because all of the proteins are self proteins. Now, the model this group used has cancer cells genetically modified to include the protein Ova, which is ovalbumin (major egg protein, and what most people are allergic to when they are allergic to eggs). The thing with Ova is that it is a GREAT antigen, and vaccine responses against Ova are always excellent . So they are using it as a model system to show how much better this adjuvant is, which is great, but this in its current formulation is curing no one. These steps are super important, so I don't want to take away from the actual study, which is a good study. However, as always, reporters pick up on the 100% cured narrative, and that simply isn't going to translate. This could be added to future vaccines, and it will be very interesting to see how much better it makes vaccines that target something besides Ova.
73866	0	a	"Even though they are ""Humanized"" mice, it doesnt change the fact that mice are mice. Even with a human immune system there are still things that wont be replicated in mice that will occur in humans. This is fundamentally the reason we can and have been able to cure mice 100% of cancer for a long time.  Cancer vaccines have been a very promising subject for a while, and there is reason to be hopeful that this vaccine will help many people. I just want to make the point that people shouldnt expect this to be the ""cure for cancer"". There is plenty more we will have to understand and discover before we can cure all cancers."

I don't have a whole lot of expertise in the field but am curious of the implications, especially in less developed parts of the world.   Edit: So since my inbox is exploding I wanted to say that I appreciate all the answers. I wasn't trying to imply the situation I laid out was likely or that I viewed that specific situation as a concern which wouldn't have been noted by ethics boards or other oversight bodies. I was merely trying to frame my original concern - that these mice may prove efficient vectors for disease among humans, and ask more about the potential for that. I think several individuals have answered this in various ways and their comments stand much better than what I could write on the matter. :)

73883	0	a	The Great American Eclipse of 2017 was perfect for the study as it was land-bound for more than 16 hours as it crossed the country. The team had the help of a few hundred elementary-schoolers, one group in Oregon, one in Idaho, and several in rural and urban locations in Missouri. They recorded the buzzing bees and sent in USB drives—or as the researcher said, “USBees”—with audio files for the study. (The school kids got to analyze the data as well, and impressively, were able to match the researcher’s findings with 91% accuracy.)  Link to abstract:- [Pollination on the Dark Side: Acoustic Monitoring Reveals Impacts of a Total Solar Eclipse on Flight Behavior and Activity Schedule of Foraging Bees](https://academic.oup.com/aesa/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aesa/say035/5123345)
73884	0	a	When that last eclipse came around it didn't really darken all that much here, but I was really surprised that all the birds went silent, and crickets and other night creatures immediately sprang into action. It wasn't any darker than if a random storm cloud passes over on an otherwise sunny day, but it seems they just don't see light/dark as humans. Perhaps more sensitive to the full spectrum that passes through heavy clouds?
73885	0	a	 It's likely just the darkness. Bees go to sleep at night, they might have temporarily stopped to die, if a bee doesn't make it home by the end of the day, it's usually a death sentence. I bet they were pretty relieved once totality ended.  Im not sure if there's a correlation there though... 
73886	0	a	How do you look at a bee and an upcoming eclipse and think “hmmm... I wonder”
73887	0	a	Do bees normally go silent at night? I have been near beehives and still heard noise then, but that could be because of me bumbling about nearby.  Just wondering if the silence is unique to this kind of thing going on or if they are just always quiet in the dark unless there is a reason.
73888	0	a	Sound like rain???  They just stop mid flight? Not bothering to try to land?
73889	0	a	I think you answered a question I didn't find resolved in the answers. During a rare circumstance like the eclipse, would the bees that were still in flower fields just fall to the ground? I assume the instant lack of buzzing implies that, as well as your lights out story
73890	0	a	From what I've read, a lot of insects can't see red light. I had to do battle with a wasp nest recently, and the advice I got was to approach at night, using a red light. It worked.
73891	0	a	You could be onto something in regards to UV spectrum.  Some animals know it is night or day even with bad eyesight. Though I imagine for certain animals and bugs it is also night temperature is far more ideal.
73892	0	a	Bees still buzz on a cloudy day or in the shade. It’s more likely based on UV light from the sun being blocked during an eclipse.
73893	0	a	If you're near the actual hive at night, you'd hear the buzzing of bees within the hive and at the entrance, circulating air and/or cooling the hive by moving their wings while keeping themselves in place.  Bees don't leave the hive at night unless they have to (fire, or something attacking the hive), and even then at night they prefer crawling to flying (which, as a beekeeper, sucks, because they're more likely to find gaps in your suit while crawling, get into your veil and sting you in the face).  Since bees tend to head back to the hive well before twilight, I'd imagine during the eclipse a bee out foraging in the flowers would be like <anthropomorphize>Oh shit! What do? Never find my way home now. Time to die...</anthropomorphize>. Which, granted, isn't that different from any diurnal animal's reaction if they're not expecting a total eclipse.
73894	0	a	Because of the simplicity of their brains it would just be an instantaneous reaction to stimuli.
73895	0	a	They're so small they don't suffer fall damage. Gravitational force is not enough to kill any type of insect. Sometimes, it's not even enough to kill a cat.

73904	0	a	The higher a cat falls after 7 stories the more likely it is to be uninjured when it lands (less than 7 stories of it jumps and isn’t thrown).  This is because 7 stories works out to the minimum time needed to orient and sprawl itself to “parachute” to the ground.
73905	0	a	I remember learning about that study in college. The data came from a veterinarian, and was mostly relevant to cats that had experienced shorter falls. Cats that had fallen from greater stories were much more likely to have died on impact, and were therefore never taken to a vet and not accounted for in the study.

Interestingly, scientists are finding that current wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs, or water resource reclamation facilities, WRRFs) already significantly reduce the concentration of microplastics in their influent streams--something they weren't even designed to do.   However, they are still a vast problem to understand. Firstly, even one microplastics particle per cubic meter creates a large loading of the particles; developed countries, and especially Western ones (and especially the US) produce incredible amounts of wastewater. Next, we are unsure of the byproducts of chemical degradation of the particles, as many plastics were created with unique ""recipes"" to give them certain characteristics such as color, durability, and so on. They may be leaching very toxic chemicals into oceans themselves, or into marine biology that certainly ingests the particles, either by accident or on purpose. Beyond that, they provide distinct biomes (""plastisphere"" to one researcher) which may play host to bacteria different enough from the norm that they also harm their predators upon ingestion. Finally, microplastics not only provide a different home for microbiology, but also for chemical attachment, serving as a surface for accumulation of hydrophobic chemicals.  I'll come back later when I have access to my computer to actually source everything. "

We don't know exactly what the effects of this are, but it's probably not good...  Edit: Also note that while the amount we consume directly may be fairly small, it also accumulates in the plants and animals we eat and becomes more concentrated. This process is termed [biomagnification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomagnification).

73924	0	a	I actually study this for my PhD research, specifically, microplastics and their associated organic pollutants in wastewater and rivers. Though WWTPs are removing them from the water, most are settling into the biosolids (treated poop), which are then land applied as fertilizer. The effects are currently unknown, with application rates being just estimates based on averages from studies on the biosolids; no one has actually measured them in the field. Part of my research will be studying advanced multimedia filtration, to determine if it can remove a significant amount of plastic debris from treated wastewater. If so, I hope this will influence policy to install this filtration process at all plants (eventually...), as many WWTPs do not have a filtration system at the end of the line.

As I went through my box of stuff to add, looking at the tags, even the stuff that is mostly cotton has elastic bits mixed in to make the jeans stretchier, or to make the socks hang on, or blended into wool to make it less delicate and more durable.  I gave up on composting fabrics and dryer lint.  Even things like feather pillows turn out to have synthetic fillers mixed in.

These are light enough to be suspended and inhalated when they are broken, e.g. from a circular saw. Since asbestos was a popular sealing material, industry workers would frequently cut asbestos on-site and inhalate these fibers. These fibers, by virtue of their needle-like structure, then embed themselves in lung tissue and continously irritate it.   This issue is not unique to asbestos but many high-hardness fiber materials like certain carbon nano tubes.

Domestic terrorism doesn't work because many of these people aren't trying to reach a political goal. A spree shooter is going for body count and not specific people.  Edit: spree shooter is bad because it already had a meaning like I mentioned. Maybe indiscriminate shooting and targeted indiscriminate shooting?

73982	0	a	"I really don't have to surmise why mass shootings are more popular now than ever, even while violence has dropped massively during my 40 years of life.  It's the way that the news portrays these events, and the shooters, more than anything.  The first major shooting that got major attention that I recall, Columbine, turned into a biopic about the two shooters.  For many people, fame itself is a goal, even with death.  Particularly if you are dealing with existential angst: our modern economic system, as a mythos, offers little more than ""make as much money as you can, retire for a while, die"".  The ""news cycle"" has repeatedly been pointed at as a cause for the increases in mass shootings, while gun ownership is more associated with suicide and accidental death in the home.  Otherwise, I blame a lot of existential angst on the fact that we live in what can best be called ""Evolutionary Humanism"", in the United States, which is becoming uglier, and was really brought on heavily by Reagan.  I personally think that we need big goals as a culture and a species, because ""work, retire, die"" certainly doesn't work for me, and evolutionary humanism basically denies the value of these collective works, outside of war.  EDIT: Lots of great responses, I wish I had more time to write a full on dissertation that attacked my own argument, but also gave it enough meat to understand that I'm not an absolutist on any of these ideals and statements, but as it is, this is social media.

Definitely not the stress of overbearing insurance guidelines, that’s for sure!
74009	0	a	I'm a retired physician. I recall seeing patients in the office. I would always review the chart before going in to see the patient. I'd make a note about something they tell me - award, retirement, graduation, etc. On f/u visit, I'd check these and ask the patient a related question. It broke the ice and established a more personal bond. This is hard to do with the current EHR.  >“EHRs are not going away, but they don’t need to be the focus of the patient’s visit,” he said. “Doctors should oppose EHRs that occupy valuable doctor-patient time and which use billing diagnoses rather than patient assessments.

74012	0	a	Primary care doc here. I love practicing medicine, and count myself incredibly lucky to do what I do. That said, I often find myself overwhelmed and exhausted by the documentation and insurance hoop-jumping.  Example: I saw a young man recently who'd hurt his knee. I examined him, and could tell he had torn his ACL. I ordered an MRI to confirm this, and referred him to a Orthopedist for repair. The next day, I got a message that the MRI had been rejected by his insurance company. To override it, I would have to call a number. I did, and spent 10 minutes working my way through a phone tree until I finally reached a human. After a long time, she was able to tell me the reason: MRIs of the knee are only approved after an X-ray is done first. As any 1st year med student could tell you, X-rays are next to useless when it comes to evaluating an injury to a ligament, and I explained that to her. She said that she might be able to bypass it, but I'd have to talk to their supervising doctor. I sat on hold for 10 more minutes, and eventually reached that doc, who immediately cleared the MRI. The whole thing took 30+ minutes.  I get why these hurdles exist: healthcare costs a ton in the US, and discouraging unneeded tests IS a big part of reeling that in. But the practical effect is that it makes necessary steps exhausting. 
74013	0	a	Can extend this beyond physicians. I work rehab and most therapists bring their laptop with them to their treatments and do documentation for other patients while they simultaneously work with their current patient. There is absolutely zero time to lose and everything is measured via a productivity standard reflected as a %. Most therapists end up clocking out and then continuing to do their work because otherwise their % would tank. It's really sad and very frustrating. There simply isn't enough time to feel enthusiastic about what you're doing.  Some clarification: Documentation substantiates the insurance claim for the rehab orders requested by the therapist. Without proper doc from the therapist the patients insurance company will discontinue therapy.

74015	0	a	It's not just insurance companies that are the problem. If you look at how typical clinics are run now, there are executive-level decisions made for the clinics by people who are not providers. The practice of medicine is no longer controlled by providers and this further complicates these issues. That feeling of cynicism comes from the fact that we don't have control of our clinic and there's always an administrator asking 'why aren't you making enough money for the clinic? Why aren't you seeing more patients?' It's not sustainable and it's going to eventually collapse and I really hope it's the administrators and insurance companies that take the fall.

We found a $2000+ charge on our bill that is not covered related to this and we’ve been playing ping-pong between the insurance company and the hospital as to who is responsible for this charge. Our daughter is now SEVEN months old. I think they just expect us to give up.  Something has got to change with the system. 
74018	0	a	"Yes! Absolutely! We get seminars and teaching about how to be ""healthy"" and ""reduce stress.""

74019	0	a	I recently read an article describing it not as burnout but as moral injury. We aren't burnt out. We struggle with the burden of giving sub par care to our patients but knowing it's all we can do because otherwise the insurance company won't foot the bill (you'll be stuck with it). We spend hours on the phone for prior authorizations while we stew over the fact that people wait months to see us.   We get into this profession generally because we believe in helping people, and we shoulder being told we can't help people every day. Moral injury. And we put up with it for the rare instance where it really feels like we did help somebody ... But those feel fewer and fewer and further and further between

When she started practicing medicine in the 80s, she said they usually had one front desk position (insurance, billing scheduling) for every three doctors. By the time she retired( about 4 years ago) the ratio was reversed due the massive increase in paperwork due to insurance companies.   Talk about administrative bloat.

74033	0	a	The current system is so abusive and dismissive of patients that it's almost beyond belief.  I went to the ER a few months ago with a knife wound to my arm (accidental, happened while sharpening my knife). I was there for about an hour and only went because I needed stiches and it was outside of hours for a walk in clinic. Before going to the ER, I literally sat waiting bleeding all over the place so that my wife could call insurance to make sure the ER was in network. After 20 minutes on the phone, they confirmed it was.  We got a $800 bill a month later. Why? Because the ER was in network, but the emergency doctor IN the ER was NOT in network. We literally called first to ensure coverage, and it didn't matter. How can the doctor in the ER not be in network when the ER itself is??? And how does 10 minutes with a doctor cost $800 bucks? It's absurd from any standpoint except the profitability of the hospital and the insurance company.   My dad is a doctor and hates the system. Conservatives hate the system. Liberals like me hate the system. And yet here we are, with the most convoluted and ridiculously inefficient medical system in the world, paying twice as much per capita as the country with the next highest costs. And we rank 40th in the world in healthcare, just below Costa Rica.  It's one of the stupidest things about America. It's just ridiculous.
74034	0	a	In many ways this applies to the patients talking to their doctors, too. I've had a doctor try to tell me to do PT and OT at once just as an academic semester was starting, as though this wasn't going to cost tons with my crappy insurance and it wasn't going to take enormous amounts of time that I didn't have. Everyone wants to have good health and low stress, but our environment causes us to put it at a lower priority. The doctors in your story were aware of that, but I've also had doctors turn around and be blithely unaware of the hard realities of their patient's lives, putting impossible expectations and requests on them. 
74035	0	a	Due to increasing litigation within the medical industry many physicians feel its necessary to get these tests to firmly establish a diagnosis. We call this “cover your ass medicine.” Many doctors know the diagnosis without the tests, but anecdotal evidence doesn’t hold up in court very well so having that MRI or CT scan may help protect you if brought to court. Patients often request these extra tests for peace of mind as well, and since many physicians are paid based on patient satisfaction, they cave to make the patient happy. Some physicians do order unnecessary tests without a doubt but there are many compounding factors, not that doctors are wasteful by nature.
74036	0	a	Absolutely affected. Before every single procedure you want to properly prescribe to your patient, you need to ask the permission from the insurance company. And they try every possible way to deny your request and keep cutting your fees while giving patients less and less benefits (money allowed towards treatments every year). And most pts don't do treatments outside of the insurance coverage. So the result is that many pts are living with a compromised treatment plan/mouth. 
74037	0	a	I’m an NP and I spend far more time documenting than I do seeing patients. Was the same when I was an RN. All this CYA is getting quite redundant. Charting in 9 different places that no the client did not have any bruising or a runny nose etc etc just so I don’t get sued takes away from my face to face time personalizing care to patients.

It takes a lot of time to click through, and you have to do it because if you don't, it leaves you vulnerable to not being paid properly for the visit by insurance companies, and also lawsuits. The result is that the physician is staring at the computer the entire time.

74048	0	a	Depression is caused by a combination of neurotransmitter problems and thought processes and to my knowledge the cause-effect relationship between those two varies from case to case. Regular exercise is great for keeping up the dopamine and serotonin levels that are effected by depression so that's why for a lot of people it can be preventative and/or therapeutic. However, we do know that depression can't be cured by regulating neurotransmitters alone--which is why antidepressants are (almost) always prescribed along with therapy--so exercising probably isn't enough to cure on its own in most cases

The parents of the elementary school kids have been the worst. The amount of tardies and complaining due to the new start time for elementary has been disruptive. They complain about getting up earlier. They complain their older kids can't watch their younger.

74061	0	a	Journal reference:  Effects of school start time on students’ sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and attendance: a meta-analysis  Jennifer M. Bowers, Anne Moyer  Sleep Health, 2017  Published Online: September 26, 2017  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2017.08.004  Link: http://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(17)30154-7/pdf  Abstract  > Research conducted over the past 3 decades finds that many children and adolescents do not meet recommended sleep guidelines. Lack of sleep is a predictor of a number of consequences, including issues at school such as sleepiness and tardiness. Considering the severity of this public health issue, it is essential to understand more about the factors that may compromise children's and adolescents' sleep. This meta-analysis examined the effects of school start time (SST) on sleep duration of students by aggregating the results of 5 longitudinal studies and 15 cross-sectional comparison group studies. Results indicated that later starting school times are associated with longer sleep durations. Additionally, later start times were associated with less daytime sleepiness (7 studies) and tardiness to school (3 studies). However, methodological considerations, such as a need for more longitudinal primary research, lead to a cautious interpretation. Overall, this systematic analysis of SST studies suggests that delaying SST is associated with benefits for students' sleep and, thus, their general well-being.
74062	0	a	This is great and all, but this requires the management of schools to actually care about the general well-being of their students.   If the management actually cared, then the national average class size wouldn't be constantly going up.   We wouldn't cut funding art, language, and shop programs.   We would should probably also stop hammering into students brains that college is the only way to be successful.   But oh well. That requires them to care about something other than standardized test scores. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
74063	0	a	Numerous studies for years have confirmed that school/work is too early and most people aren't getting enough sleep. This is not new information by any means.  What we *need* is for something to be done about it,
74064	0	a	All it takes is districts to do it but the parents won't like it. The thing is that if they were forced to do it then employers would be forced to comply lest they lose their workforce to other employers.

74066	0	a	The problem is that changing school hours has ripple effects on other parts of society. So far society has decided that the downsides of maintaining the existing school hours are not as great as the downsides of changing the school hours.

74068	0	a	Institutional inertia.
74069	0	a	the arguments against are pretty solid ones. high school students tend to do sports or get jobs, and getting off too late does complicate things.   imo, sleep is more important than sports and schools should simply be more accommodating for students that have jobs by letting them leave earlier. i learned more from my first job than any single class in high school anyway. 
74070	0	a	Some other users have given you some of the reasons, but it's rather complex is why.  Transportation is a huge part of it. Busing students in a large district is complex. Often they have to stagger school start times so all students who need to be bused can get there. If the district works with public transport systems as well to have special buses or route times, they have to work this out with them. Parents who drive their kids before work might be unable to anymore as well.  Then of course there is the fact that many American's have to be at work by 8-9am. If school started later, this would conflict with larger work start times, which is not easily changed. Schools can potentially offer earlier before school programs to combat this, but this is a larger cost potentially for the school and requires it's own coordination.  Others have pointed out as well that there are large numbers of high school students who rely on having time after school to work or care for family. If they stay later than their younger siblings, they may be unable to pick them up or provide childcare (which for some families is a sad truth as childcare is not affordable).  There is also the entire issue of after school programs. If you shift to schools starting later, after school programs start to press into what is usually dinner time in some households. Or children are then potentially walking/busing home from after school programs in the dark in some places where daylight savings leaves the sun setting early, which is a concern for some families.  So...  **Tl;dr** - Transportation, work, after/before school program, and childcare issues point to the complexity of changing what appears to be something as minor as a school start time.
74071	0	a	That's true, but I doubt teens naturally have the need to consistently sleep at midnight or 1am every day. Hundreds of years ago, people simply slept when they were tired or it's been dark for a few hours, it's modern society that's forcing new sleep cycles. 
74072	0	a	"Honestly, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. My school starts at 8:00, but sometimes we have a ""late start"" at 9:30 due to meetings, and most people are able to show up that late. The ones whose parents have to drop them off before work still drop them off ~8:30 for 9-5 jobs, and then they just sleep at school until it starts. For people who can drive themselves to school, it's obviously no issue.   Honestly, it would just require an expansion of bus routes to be perfect. If every student can walk/bike/drive to either school or a bus stop within 10-20 minutes, there'd be no problem, and given how the location of students is spread out, it'd only take a few routes to cover more than 90% of students. Obviously, public schools would need more funding to expand routes, though, and they need more funding in general.   **edit:** to address some comments I've received multiple times:  Public schools do need *much* more funding. This is a general problem, and one that doesn't really have much of a solution in most of America, since *certain groups* \*cough\* don't want to teach the electorate because uneducated people benefit them politically.   Also, teenagers do in many circumstances need to get home earlier to look after kids. I didn't consider this since my community mostly has either single children, or 2-3 kids of similar ages, but it's definitely a problem in other areas.  **edit 2:** obviously my particular suggestion only works in relatively affluent (or at least middle-class) areas, like where I go to school. It doesn't work if many parents have to work before 8 (although if kids are reliable enough to walk to a bus stop, it does), or if high-school age teens have to care for younger children. "

74077	0	a	No.  The problem is that teenagers need more sleep than adults do, often 9 to 10 hours of sleep.  So if they have to get up at 5:30 am to catch the bus at 6:30 to be at school at 7:15, they would have to go to bed at 7:30 at night to get enough sleep.  But they're not tired at 7:30 at night.
74078	0	a	Imo that's not a fair argument. For teenagers, it's more natural to stay up late and wake up late. I can go to sleep at 4 am and wake up at 10 am perfectly fine (with only 6 hours of sleep), but I can go to sleep at 9 pm and wake up at 6 am and be tired all day long, with 9 hours of sleep. I could work until 4 am every day, and be completely fine. 
74079	0	a	"A lot of it has to do with hormone levels. Try going camping at some point - when you are exposed to nature for a couple days, you near instantly snap to waking up with the sunrise and getting tired when it gets dark with little variance (which is where personal sleep rhythm comes in).  The modern high school student is waking up before the sun rises, riding a bus with minimal exposure to early morning sunrise, going to a school with terrible natural lighting until 3 in the afternoon, maybe doing an outdoor extracurricular from 3-4, going home and then being in artificial lighting / in front of screens all night. Your body just does not handle that at all, regardless of age. It is why this isn't just a problem with children, adults are substantially addicted to sleep aids for similar reasons.  Top all of that off with how, during your most ""active"" hours a teenager is relegated to sitting in one place for 40-60 minutes at a time for 7 hours straight and of course it screws up their bodies."

While the results may seem intuitive, the study is one of the first to provide evidence that sleep loss causes anger.  Other studies have shown a link between sleep and anger, but questions remained about whether sleep loss was to blame or if anger was responsible for disrupted sleep, said Zlatan Krizan, professor of psychology at Iowa State.

Also, the absolute anger scores were actually lower for the sleep-restricted groups (though the interaction with task annoyingness stands).

Online questionnaires ascertained athletic and military history.  **Exposures**  Participation in American football at any level of play.  **Main Outcomes and Measures**  Neuropathological diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, including CTE, based on defined diagnostic criteria; CTE neuropathological severity (stages I to IV or dichotomized into mild [stages I and II] and severe [stages III and IV]); informant-reported athletic history and, for players who died in 2014 or later, clinical presentation, including behavior, mood, and cognitive symptoms and dementia.  **Results**  Among 202 deceased former football players (median age at death, 66 years [interquartile range, 47-76 years]), CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players (87%; median age at death, 67 years [interquartile range, 52-77 years]; mean years of football participation, 15.1 [SD, 5.2]), including 0 of 2 pre–high school, 3 of 14 high school (21%), 48 of 53 college (91%), 9 of 14 semiprofessional (64%), 7 of 8 Canadian Football League (88%), and 110 of 111 National Football League (99%) players. Neuropathological severity of CTE was distributed across the highest level of play, with all 3 former high school players having mild pathology and the majority of former college (27 [56%]), semiprofessional (5 [56%]), and professional (101 [86%]) players having severe pathology. Among 27 participants with mild CTE pathology, 26 (96%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 23 (85%) had cognitive symptoms, and 9 (33%) had signs of dementia. Among 84 participants with severe CTE pathology, 75 (89%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 80 (95%) had cognitive symptoms, and 71 (85%) had signs of dementia.  **Conclusions and Relevance**  In a convenience sample of deceased football players who donated their brains for research, a high proportion had neuropathological evidence of CTE, suggesting that CTE may be related to prior participation in football.
74102	0	a	This is what bothers me. We all know football is terrible for your brain. But the NFL thinks if they acknowledge it we won't be fans anymore. Which isn't the case at all. I would have more respect for the Shield if they said we know its terrible and we're doing everything in our power to make it safer. With new tackling techniques at lower levels to better equipment.
74103	0	a	Has there been any research comparing the prevalence of CTE in Rugby Union as compared to the NFL? Because there is interesting research [1](http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/36/1/19) [2](http://thejns.org/doi/pdf/10.3171/2016.1.FOCUS15615) [3](http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/35/2/89.short) surrounding risk compensation in Rugby. This is where players who wear protective headgear (soft padding) showed no reduction in concussion rate, compared to those who don't. Increased aggression and feelings of safety have been attributed to the lack of concussion reduction in players who wear protective headgear. Would there ever be a scenario where the NFL reduces the protectiveness of helmets to increase feelings of vulnerability and therefore self-preservation?
74104	0	a	Close to 9% is about 1 guy actively playing on the field for each team at any given moment.  
74105	0	a	Absolutely. While this study cannot show a correlation that you have a certain chance or risk of developing CTE from playing football (though there may certainly be one), it does at least confirm that the symptoms these players exhibited were likely due to CTE. For years players have been told to hide these symptoms because it means they are weak or less of a man. This study is a first step that will open the door to players admitting they have symptoms and seeking help sooner.
74106	0	a	"I love that this is the top reddit comment whereas the top comment on the NYT article is this: ""I think this would lead one to conclude there is no safe way to play football in it's current form. Only if enough people stop watching it and stop allowing their children to play it, will this madness end.""  "
74107	0	a	I would like to push back against that label here, that the headline is sensationalized. I would argue that it is the naive interpretation of the headline that is the sensationalization and I would like to think we can assume that readers have appropriate critical faculties. I don't believe this constitutes deliberately misleading spin (or similar).
74108	0	a	At this point, yes. But hopefully we'll get some diagnostic tools (PET looks promising) that can diagnose CTE in living individuals. Then you could imagine getting a true random sample of NFL players. Actually, you could probably scan all of them.
74109	0	a	Not really. The consensus criteria for CTE were only really established in 2015, and still can only be diagnosed after death. True population studies are needed, but that will require diagnostic methods that can be applied to living individuals.
74110	0	a	They think if they acknowledge it they'll lose a ton of money in lawsuits and parents will stop putting their kids in football, meaning the talent pool and cult following dries up.  
74111	0	a	Helmets probably make the game more dangerous.  They allow more force to hit the brain while reducing painful bruises that would otherwise discourage head impact.
74112	0	a	That's the lower bound too
74113	0	a	"While the possibility of brain trauma was most certainly glossed over through the past century, over the past 15-20 years it's been extremely well discussed as a health issue and over the past 5-10 years (depending on program) it's been taken extremely seriously at the college level, to go along with the NFL level.  An NFL player today saying they don't know the risks is like a smoker today saying they don't know the risks.  Everyone on that field knows brain injury is a possibility, and a handful have walked away from millions of dollars because of it, but for most it's worth the risk.    The NFL may be culpable for looking the other way when evidence emerged in the 80s and 90s, but I don't see how anyone playing today can say they've been lied to.  They've paid out on lawsuits, and they'll likely pay out on more, from players of the past era (the time between evidence emerging but before the NFL seemed to care).  Coaches today drills into their boys from High School through NFL how important taking care of yourself is if even the first signs of brain trauma emerge.    I played football in high school in the 90s, I had 3 concussions (diagnosed) and probably 2 more undiagnosed that I'm pretty sure about.  I was treated as a ""hammer"" and my teammates and coaches revered how balls-to-the-wall hard I would go in order to ""nail"" opposing team members by launching into them.  I played Wedge Buster (Wedges are now banned at high school, college, and NFL levels for this reason) on kickoffs, stand-up DE on defense, and TE on offense.  I was always on the field, taking and giving hits.  And the only risk of head injury was that I'd have to miss the rest of the game, but I'd be back next week.    Times have changed since them.  Wedges are illegal now, like I said.  Concussions get you sent to the doctor and you miss half the season.  Coaches don't encourage launching in/trying to destroy other teams' players.  It's not how it was in my day, and that's a good thing.  I still love the sport of football, despite my injury history (I also tore up a knee, a shoulder, and fractured a vertebrae in my back).  It's an amazing sport that's fun to play and entertaining to watch.  Players today are taken care of in a much better way than when I played, and are all well aware of the risks.  "
74114	0	a	Also they're trying to protect their livelihood. If you are removed from the game by your trainers for concussions every time you take/give a big hit in football you aren't gonna have a long career in the NFL. 
74115	0	a	It’s 9% *at minimum*. The quote is true.
74116	0	a	I really think that we need to see if there is a correlation with short term football playing (HS only, HS and College, or HS College and short NFL stint) and CTE. If the prevalence is very high in professional athletes that is one thing (certainly not ok, but some level of increased issues is expected with any sport). People still box and we all know how bad that is. I think that it is an acceptable risk if you are going to be playing at the top level and getting paid millions of dollars to do it. I want to know if High School football players are actually being exposed to similar CTE risk rates, as that would be cause to potentially limit or even stop playing of the sport (I say this, even as someone who is a massive football fan and played in HS)
74117	0	a	"Exactly.  The headline is accurate. That is what the study found.  People are trying to pull some other conclusion out of that, something like ""this means 99 percent of NFL players have CTE,"" which is *not what the headline says*. Nor what the study is claiming to have found.  That's why the story is there. To provide context."
74118	0	a	I just don't understand why we have to... the premise that bashing your head into things is generally bad for your long term health is well established. 
74119	0	a	It's kinda funny that of all things, professional wrestling started this ball in motion. After the 2007 Benoit tragedy, when a independent autopsy revealed something like 70+ concussions, alot of Doctors took note. A program of sorts was set up, like a foundation, for contact injuries. I'd guess some trickle down changes affected this. 
74120	0	a	This is not necessarily a bad thing.  It is a brutal, violent sport, and kids getting head trauma early in life are getting hosed.  Add to this the insane focus of the NCAA machine and warped priorities in the university system - if American football shrunk to the size of, say, lacrosse, there could be a significant benefit to society and the quality of higher education in this country.
74121	0	a	Hell yea. Love football but I didn't play it; grew up on rugby and played it in college too. never met a rugger who'd actually try to use their unprotected head as a weapon. That'd be suicide.   and as a lifelong NFL fan I feel safe saying more players use their helmets as a weapon than thinking of it as protection. Seems like it's becoming even more prevalent too.
74122	0	a	Lowest possible to the point that it is unrealistic.
74123	0	a	Most NFL players playing today committed to the sport before most of the major CTE/concussion stuff was widely know (if it even is at this point). It's definitely not comparable to widespread knowledge about smoking yet. In a few years, maybe. 
74124	0	a	i expect they're protecting the game itself - say the truth is in the middle, and 2/3 of football players end up with CTE, are people really going to want to continue supporting a sport where only 1 in 3 players *doesn't* end up with a traumatic brain injury?
74125	0	a	48 of the 53 college football players tested positive for cte in this study.  As a 22 year old who just finished playing college ball and is already experiencing several symptoms this scares the hell out of me.  
74126	0	a	That's what I was thinking too.  College players are the hugely disadvantaged group.  NFL players at least got paid and gave pension.  
74127	0	a	"yes, but the sport organizations will just say ""oh the damage is very small, basically negligible, there are no proven links to problems later in life"" and then they'll say ""well players know it and they're ok with it, it's their heads, they can do what they want"" and do their best to change nothing  it's like smoking: people knew it was bad for you for decades before laws against it started to pop up, and without hard numbers and scientific studies, they'll never do anything"
74128	0	a	I don't think you can pinpoint one date or event like that.  It's been a gradual awareness and education.  For example, the NHL has had concussion policies and baseline testing in place for 10 years before the Benoit incident.
74129	0	a	At the professional level I'd think there's more dangerous things you could do for that much money. I'd be more worried if these kinds of injuries are similarly common at college and high-school level. 
74130	0	a	"There's an entire socioeconomic stratum\† in the US where professional sports are basically the only reliable single generation route out of poverty and into the rich class. (There are alternatives to reach middle income but the most reliable of those involves being willing to be sent to a warzone).   There will always be poor young men who think the NFL is their only choice.   Edit: reliable was probably not the best word choice. I meant reliable in the sense of 'predictable path' (do well in HS, get recruited for college, do well in college, get drafted) where other paths involve a lot of hard work with uncertain payoff even if you're the best; no one will judge you for going to division I state U for college ball instead of UCLA as long as your forty is low enough.   Substitute ""predictable, plausible, achievable"" etc.   Almost every poor neighborhood above a certain size in the US has some football or basketball star to it's name; this is not the case for CEOs or Actors, Technocrats, etc. "
74131	0	a	That's what he means by lower bound.
74132	0	a	I think that's the big question, though.  Are higher rates of CTE caused by the hits in the NFL? Or are the higher rates due to the history of hits across a player's career?  Very simply, is it caused by playing professional football or just by playing an average football career (peewee to high school)?
74133	0	a	Have any studies been done on that?   edit: [Here's one that's concerning.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3922228/)  Some studies seem to indicate that long term damage is not really a concern at High School levels of play.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5382791/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538465/  Edit 2: On a cursory reading, it seems like kids at the High School level at least get pulled really quick from games and are kept out if they are showing signs of injury. I would hazard to guess that when your paycheque is on the line, you're much less willing to sit out seasons to recover from a concussion or TBI. 
74134	0	a	...oh
74135	0	a	Not a joke: some are making that choice with already-damaged decision-making ability.
74136	0	a	">Players today know the risks  i really doubt your average football player is really aware of the damage they're doing to their own brain or realize how much it will impact them when they are older, and it's even less likely that new or aspiring players are aware  try putting at the entrance of every football stadiums large signs that say ""Warning: playing this sport may cause brain damage, memory loss, dementia and other problems"" like they did with cigarettes and we'll see if nothing changes  besides, it's possible they could vastly improve the safety of the sport with very little changes to how they play by just improving their gear or forcing organizations to pay for health coverage and support, it's not like people want the sport to be abolished"
74137	0	a	There have been cases of high school players dying with CTE. The important thing to note is that the cause for CTE isn't so much the highlight hits that football is known for, those cause concussions, but the smaller hits that players take repeatedly. Linemen are hitting heads on every play, and other players are making head contact probably a couple dozen times a game at least. That's going to build up regardless of level of play.
74138	0	a	This seems like a good thing, since medical marijuana seems to have [decreased the amount of hospitalizations related to opioid dependence or overdose.](http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716\(17\)30076-5/abstract)
74139	0	a	I didnt know cannabis could be used to treat depression, from what I've seen most of the friends I used to have who smoked pot constantly were actually more depressed than the people who smoked it occasionally. Could someone point me to a study or something about this? I'm genuinely curious.  Edit: did not expect this many responses! Thank you guys for your input!!
74140	0	a	>mostly in states where pot is legal  From the article, page 2 (bolding mine):  >All 50 states were represented in the study, though over half of the respondents were from states that have legalized medical cannabis use: Washington, Oregon, California, and Colorado. **There was not a statistically significant difference in the rate of substitution in states where medical cannabis was legal versus states that had not legalized its use**, suggesting that accessibility of legal medical cannabis is not the driving factor for its rise in popularity in treating pain, anxiety, and depression.

74142	0	a	"I see a lot of anecdotal responses saying something like: ""Cannabis really helps with **XX** because every time I smoke weed I actually get more **XX** not less?""    One thing to remember is that cannabinoids mess with brain chemistry, and anything that messes with brain chemistry will have different effects on different people's brains.  This is true of any medication that messes with brain chemistry.    As an example I have been prescribed Clonazepam for my anxiety several times by several different doctors with the promise that it is like cannabis without the high.  I am sure for many people it is just like cannabis without the high, but for me it feels like my brain is being strangled.  I can't think straight at all, simple problems like navigating my daughter's messy room becomes an impossible task because I literally can not figure out how to walk around the stuff in my way.  This in turn makes me angry and because the Clonazepam inhibits my ability to control anger I am really likely to start yelling and throwing stuff.  Not good at all...  In the end cannabis might make you personally really anxious/depressed/lazy, but that might just be a you thing."
74143	0	a	Also, states with legal medical cannabis have reported fewer opioid-overdose caused deaths: http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1898878
74144	0	a	it's funny how less people using opioids can somehow coincide with less people being hospitalized for opioid dependence/overdose. I doubt anyone could have predicted that outcome.
74145	0	a	You'll find lots of people claiming it's an effective treatment for any ailment under the sun. Because it makes them feel better. That doesn't mean it's without its own baggage, though, and self-medicating is a dangerous thing. 
74146	0	a	I think from checking out some recent studies the trick is to only take very low doses of THC (maybe higher CBDs as well for good measure).  The more THC in your system the more it gives you the opposite intended effect of increased paranoia, anxiety and depression.  I love marijuana too much and can't be responsible to only take small doses, so I had to quit all together because the negative was out weighing the positive for me.
74147	0	a	Thanks for posting this question. I think it's important to remember here that everyone is different. For me, coming down from a high spikes my anxiety, to the point that I become dissociative. I would argue that the body's response to marijuana, just like the response of any other drug, really is a case-by-case basis.
74148	0	a	I wonder... were they depressed *because* they were smoking pot, or were they regularly smoking pot *because* they were depressed? 
74149	0	a	Except that those states are legalized for **recreational** use. There are at least 20 states that have legalized cannabis for medical use.
74150	0	a	Wait, so are there marijuana related hospitalizations?  How do they differentiate between it being marijuana connected and the person just happening to have marijuana in their system?

74153	0	a	"You've hit on the real issue here. Every time this comes up -- on reddit, with friends, even with my father-in-law -- the anti-marijuana crowd (or ""skeptical of marijuana"" crowd) insists on putting the chicken before the egg. They assume all people are mentally healthy until they start smoking -- an easy and default assumption from people who *are* mentally healthy -- when in reality, a high percentage of recreational users are doing it to self-medicate, whether they realize it or not.  The chicken-before-the-eggers also nearly always assume that depression is a single state of being -- you're either depressed or not depressed -- rather than an enormous sliding scale. Many people with severe depression smoke to bring it down to a manageable scale, not to get rid of it completely. I'm one of those. And a lot of the daily smokers I've known have vouched for that.  TL;DR People see someone with depression, antisocial tendencies, or an emotional/behavioral issue who smokes and assume that the marijuana caused it, when in reality MJ is probably helping them live a higher-quality life."

In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N = 15,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design. We provide initial evidence that people’s ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after gameplay, irrespective of education, age, political ideology, and cognitive style.
74162	0	a	"I find the implications of this game a bit scary. It immediately tries to goad its players into believing that anything claiming to be ""against mainstream media"" is automatically untrustworthy. That is most certainly not the case.  Almost all mainstream media is owned by a handful of companies, they have a lot of free reign to spread something misleading themselves.

74165	0	a	It is taught quite extensively, actually. Reading comprehension, literary analysis, philosophy, mathematics - these are all high school level subjects that are available in most public schools and colleges. I think that the real issue isn't volume of information, rather, the accessibility may be reduced because of our inability to engage people's interests.

74167	0	a	I mean isn’t this just education?  Why am I skeptical of the “Iran attacks on ships” as a pretense for war? Because in my education I was shown examples of how unrelated attacks were used as a pretense for war in the past. Lusitania. The other one in the harbor etc.

74169	0	a	That’s a genius way to teach people. Playing as your opponent gives a ton of insight into their strategies and does a great job teaching you how to best counter them.  In a similar vein, I’ve always noticed that whenever I play video games and am getting countered by a certain character or class, if I spend time learning how to play character that has been countering me, then it helps a ton with being able to beat them bc I understand their goals and strategies.

74174	0	a	Mainstream media isn’t great. But sources that need to constantly claim to be against mainstream media is sketchy.  I mean if it were just stating facts and evidence, it wouldn’t always have to claim to be against the mainstream like that.
74175	0	a	Its taught incorrectly imo. We are forced to write papers and have sources because we have to. As someone else mentioned, I didn't learn about fallacies until college. By the time we're in high school assignments require sources because you're told they do. They teach you how to cite a source and how to write a bibliography, but they never teach you why. The minimal peer editing that does happen never has you check another students sources, so to the students they are unimportant and a waste of time.
74176	0	a	I think Lusitania is probably the worst example you could give.   It did actually kill more than 100 American civilians, the Germans did actually sink it, it just increased hostility b/c the US didn’t enter the war in May 1915 but in 1917 with the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare (and Germany caught trying to coax Mexico into invading the US).   German naval policy was very much related to US sympathies in WWI, even if unfairly
74177	0	a	>Playing as your opponent gives a ton of insight into their strategies and does a great job teaching you how to best counter them.  This actually has been a part of military exercises since at least WWII, when a British program had new officers play essentially a tabletop war-game against each other in order to prepare them for German submarines. It was through this that they actually discovered a few of the tactics the submarines were using! For instance, some clever officers found that as a submarine, they could hide inside the convoy because an attack would cause ship crews to investigate the waters away from the convoy.

74180	0	a	Well, I'd say there's some level of risk of blowback if you do pretty much anything related to misinformation. The game isn't ideologically polarised or slanted, insofar as that is humanly possible, and part of the point is to convey that misinformation takes on certain patterns or characteristics regardless of its ideological slant, which we hope people will recognise when they are confronted with a piece of deceptive content, even if they might personally agree with it.
74181	0	a	I agree. If he wants an example from American history, all he has to do is look at the Gulf of Tonkin incident that led to the major expansion and escalation of American involvement in Vietnam.

74183	0	a	[Study Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X19303677)  Abstract: The period from 2019 to 2020 is critical in determining whether the World Trade Organization (WTO), tasked with eliminating capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies, can deliver to the world an agreement that will discipline subsidies that lead to overfishing. Here, following extensive data collection efforts, we present an update of the current scope, amount and analysis of the level of subsidisation of the fisheries sector worldwide. We estimate global fisheries subsidies at USD 35.4 billion in 2018, of which capacity-enhancing subsidies are USD 22.2 billion. The top five subsidising political entities (China, European Union, USA, Republic of Korea and Japan) contribute 58% (USD 20.5 billion) of the total estimated subsidy. The updated global figure has decreased since the most recent previous estimate from 2009, of USD 41.4 billion in 2018 constant dollars. The difference between these two estimates can be largely explained by improvements in methodology and the difference in the actual amount of subsidies provided. Thus, we consider direct statistical comparison of these numbers to be inappropriate. Having said that, the difference between the estimates suggest that the increase in fisheries subsidies provided in the preceding decades may have halted. Still, the bulk of harmful ‘capacity-enhancing’ subsidies, particularly those for fossil fuels have actually increased as a proportion of total subsidies. As such, for the benefit of marine ecosystems, and current and future generations of people, all hands must be on deck in helping the WTO reach a meaningful agreement to discipline subsidies that lead to overcapacity and overfishing.

74191	0	a	I am going to piggyback on this comment. I just got back from doing two Pacific Ocean fishing patrols. It is insane how much fishing is going on. We were doing inspections on boats that would spend years on the water and be replenished at sea and off load to transshipment vessels.   The other major issue we encountered was garbage. As of right now, there are no major laws regarding the disposal of trash on the high seas. These people would be just throwing plastic over the side of the ship right in front of us and there wasn’t anything we could do. So all we did was make a note on the inspection form and hope that the North Pacific Fisheries Commission will make a law about it in the future.   We were gone for three months. Did 44 vessel inspections. Had 60+ violations. Very few were found satisfactory.

If less people would buy them, there would be less people fishing them.  The government is giving too much money to fishermen, allowing them to fish when otherwise it wouldn't be worth it.  Because fishermen are fishing when they otherwise would not, too many fish are being fished. Because the government is funding part of the fishing, the fish are cheaper than they should be, so too many are being fished. The market can not self correct.

Meat isn't a regular thing in the diet of the rest 30-40% who eat meat as well. That's why, it's endless, what we've done with veggies here. Me or my parents have never felt the need to eat meat. Still when I go outside, I discover a new vegetarian food everyday. Had amazing kathi rolls yesterday. You can try more Indian too. It's a paradise for vegetarians.   **Edit**: Some vegetarian dishes I'm recommending (you can Google and make some): Dal Makhani, Dal tadka, Shahi Paneer, Palak Paneer, Navrattan Korma, Dam Aaloo, Rajma chawal, Aaloo poori, Chhole Bhature, Pav Bhaji, Dosa, Idli, Vada, Veg chowmein, Aaloo Gobhi, Mushroom Matar, veg Pulao, Malai Kofta, Aaloo Paranthas etc.  All these are eaten with either Naan, Roti/Chapati, or Rice.  Now there are 29 states in India, each one having their own vegetarian cuisine, you can look up for these online. This is just less than a percent of recommendations to start with. Every food item you'll buy here will have a label. Green for vegetarian and red for non vegetarian.

74203	0	a	"Dr. John Gottman was able to predict with nearly 90% accuracy, which couples would get a divorce, simply by the way they argued. He worked with a mathematician on it and developed a formula which was so accurate and could be applied so broadly, it was even able to predict when countries would go from rhetorical and trade conflict, to all out war. It can be applied to any entity having a dispute, absolutely amazing.  His finding were that it really came down to two things:  1. Could they stay on topic, and discuss the heart/cause of the problem as opposed to the manifested facets. Could they discuss the disease, and not just the symptoms, and 2. Were they respectful in their discourse, or did they degrade to personal attacks that did not address the issue at hand.  Choosing your battles strategically is definitely the key, as many people argue about how they feel, as opposed to what the heart of the problem is, or they make fights out of things that should not be an issue.  Thought I am curious as to what ""more difficult to resolve"" means here. Dr. Gottman's finding are that this is exactly what should be address, the real issues (which are usually the ones that are more difficult to resolve), and that people usually default to fighting over nonsense precisely because they want to avoid the tougher talks, or don't know how to address them.

She comes from a country where, culturally, things are not thrown away and repairs are performed on even the most trivial of belongings.   This isn't to say we have a perfect relationship but our default is to repair rather than throw out which reflects in the way we take care of the physical objects around us too. I'm only speaking for myself, obviously, but it seems like there must be a mindset of ""repair if at all possible"" for a marriage to work long-term."

74209	0	a	Actually, I think Dr. Gottman's work does support the idea of focusing on solvable problems. In his book he spends several chapters discussing the difference between 'solvable' and 'unsolvable' problems, and suggests that couples should seek to reach compromises continually on unsolvable problems, but acknowledge that they will never go away. I'm sure the concept is more complex than I've described it here, but I actually think that this article is in agreement with his theory.  His book is called *The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work*, in case you're interested in reading it and haven't already. I highly recommend it!
74210	0	a	It’s fascinating that this could be translated not only across subjects but countries. The fact that it boils down to this handful of points is amazing.  Speaks to the whole human behaviour is a part of a predictable pattern of actions/behaviours?  Side note: Me and my partner always look to get to the heart of an issue and maintain a dialogue when we argue, we’ve absolutely felt the positive impact but at the time talking about the heart of it can be difficult, but Jiminy Cricket if we don’t feel better afterwards and know each other that bit better.
74211	0	a	One thing I’ve learned in my marriage and in observing friends and family—when we read articles like this, it is SO easy to put the blame on the other person. So for example, point 1 says both people in the relationship need to stay on topic, and discuss the disease, not go around in circles discussing the symptoms. It is so easy and common to read that and think to yourself “ugh see, our relationship be so much better if he/she would learn to do that. *I* am perfect and any problems in our communication style is their fault, never mine.” There are some really helpful resources out there with advice for couples, but I’ll see people like my parents tape these to the fridge or email them to each other as a passive aggressive way of saying “see, this is why we have problems, YOU need to improve on this.”  You cannot change people. You just can’t. But you can work on yourself. Even if you don’t feel like your partner deserves it, or even if you think “what’s the point, even if I change they’ll always be the same and then I’m doing all the work,” just TRY to implement the suggested changes. Often a shift in the overall tone of the discussion will allow the other person to feel less defensive and more open to engaging in productive problem solving.   Another thing I’ve noticed: there are things in our marriage that my husband and I disagree on that we just choose to move on from, but the trick is not to be resentful. There is a big difference between “he’s not going to change anyway so I just live with it and get more bitter every day” versus “eh, it’s who he is, and I’ve accepted him faults and all.” There are things my husband has done or does currently that make my mom freak out about and say if that was HER husband she would be FURIOUS and how his behaviour is a BIG PROBLEM. Things like sometimes he’s loud and wakes me up or he’s a clumsy person and breaks things by accident. Sure it can be annoying but I’ve accepted that’s who he is so when it happens I’m not angry or bothered. I forget about it 3 mins after it happens. And I know there’s loads of things about me my husband lets go of. We don’t have a perfect marriage but I can say I still love being with him after 10 years and I still admire and respect him a lot.
74212	0	a	Focusing on easier, more solvable problems gives couples the relationship footing to approach the bigger issues or causes them to minimize naturally. It doesn't say they never approach them, just that they approach them less than easier ones. There's likely less of those big issues looming in the first place too if they're still together and identifying as happy.
74213	0	a	This is why I am about to celebrate 25 years. Focus on the issue! Be open and honest, even when it is hard. Find a compromise. The fight isn’t about the towel on the floor, it is about the pattern of one person feeling left to carry a load, or not being appreciated, or the other recognizing that they aren’t planning enough time to get ready in the morning, or not valuing the clean bathroom in the same way.   It often isn’t the one thing in front of you, but use that to identify the feeling and the larger issue to which it connects.   But even though we fight well, we all fail sometimes. I’m gonna have to go dirty fighting on you cause I’m mean and I like to swear.

When the trainer would point to an object, the dogs always looked at the object while the wolves did not.  I also recall a part where they tried to ~~domestically raise~~ tame a wolf cub in the house but the experiment failed and the wolf ate the kitchen table. Maybe they need to be outside?

74232	0	a	Wolves have a clear family and social structure that we are able to exploit for domestication. You can actually look at plenty of different species on the planet and see that the ones with social structures have been way easier to domesticate by humans.
74233	0	a	A reminder that a lot of this research has been funded and happened because of the great book, The Wolf in the Parlor, by the 2-time Pulitzer Prize winning science writer Jon Franklin. He noted the lack of dog-based research, how we almost take them for granted, so to speak. All the facial recognition, and a range of other research, has come in the wake of that wonderful book. A must read for anyone curious about the ancient partnership - that's what it was and is - and what it means today
74234	0	a	So, domesticated wolves can do the same tasks as domesticated dogs after domestication, but it didn't have much to do with domestication?  I think there's little doubt that the species has a natural tendency for social structure and cooperation and that this natural trait is the reason for the relationship, that doesn't mean that it wasn't greatly enhanced by domestication.  The entire population here seems really odd.  Edit - I get the technical definition between training and domestication, but I think in this context it is trying to lean on that technical distinction too much. Being trained by a human is being trained by a human and introduces changes to the behavior... which is what training is supposed to do and is the property we are talking about. Training is not domestication, but sure as hell isn't a purely wild metric, either.

74238	0	a	"It's my conjecture based on being around wolves, wolfdogs, and dogs, that we have been able to cohabitate with canines for a very long time, however with dogs we bred out their independent nature. Wolves maintain a more independent role when working with us or being around us. A wolf would likely turn on you much faster as well.  Wolves dont usually take actions aggressively if they arent sure they can win. Dogs tend to be aggressive when playing, but they're not really ""aggressive"" unless people teach it to them by cruel means. However, wolves and dogs both respond to food and can be trained to walk side by side with you. But those few key differences make a huge difference when it comes to subservient nature. Wolves dont believe they are under us, they merely work with us for a time."
74239	0	a	Well if you look at it from the domestication point if view, most dogs were bred throughout history as working animals, and it's probably safe to assume that obedience to human orders was a searched for and selected trait. So whilst dogs have a general social tendency to look to their humans for commands before acting, human-raised wolves probably see their humans as more as a pack member than a commander, leaving them to rely on their own intuition as well as external guidance

There are three very interesting things about people with Williams Syndrome. Number one, they are really nice. Like if you meet someone with Williams Syndrome, you will think “This person clearly has a rare genetic disease that causes pathological levels of niceness as a symptom.” Number two, they are really trusting. An Atlantic article profiling the condition, What Happens When You Trust Too Much? describes special therapy for Williams Syndrome children where the therapist has to teach them, painfully and laboriously, how to distrust people. NPR calls it “essentially biologically impossible for kids [with Williams Syndrome] to distrust [people].” Number three, they talk all the time; the informal name for the condition is “cocktail personality syndrome”.  >People with Williams Syndromes actually legitimately have short noses (compare to the short snout on domesticated foxes), smaller teeth (compare to smaller teeth in dogs vs. wolves), smaller brains, and “unusually shaped ears”    https://www.insidescience.org/news/rare-human-syndrome-may-explain-why-dogs-are-so-friendly  Turns out WBSCR17 (The WBS in the name stands for “Williams-Beuren Syndrome” ) differs quite a bit between dogs and wolves.   That along with the ease of breeding canines for friendliness that seems to come with host of bundled phenotypic changes that happen to mirror Williams-Beuren Syndrome seems to give some good hints.

But the conventional wisdom in the past has been that dogs bond better with humans and understand human interaction better.  this may complicate that story a little.   it may be better to say that domestication primarily just improves the personality of dogs. Made them more docile, more tolerant and less inclined to be dominant.

74249	0	a	Yeah, intelligent animals should be capable of either spontaneously, or after training, to understand what our pointing means. Though I wonder how thr latter would work. Could a wolf be trained to focus on where we point, even if they don't do so as easily as a dog?
74250	0	a	Wolves point with their noses and ears, so I think our version of pointing is definitely something they are capable of learning. I think it's important to note that they haven't passed the pointing test 'so far'. Dogs are focused on us. They don't want to upset us, so we can raise them in our houses where they spend a lot of time watching us. They're interested in our voice commands, and so you can use a voice command to hold them, point toward a hidden treat and say go find it. Soon enough they'll understand what pointing is.  As was pointed out in an earlier comment, wolf cubs can't really be raised the same way. They spend less time watching us, especially as juveniles, and they don't care nearly as much what we want, and they're not going to wait for us. You could try training them what pointing means, but the first pattern they're going to recognize is that there's food somewhere in their compound, and they're just going to go look for it immediately without looking at you to know that you're pointing. Otherwise, I bet pointing to a nice chunk of beef liver would teach them.
74251	0	a	There's studies   https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08837  but someone would probably have to induce the mutations in question in some wolf embryos to prove causation.   if they come out floppy eared with small teeth and friendly/trusting  personalities vs the control wolves then hypothesis proven with pretty much certainty.   Though we are certain about the human genetic disorder, it's causes and it's effects.

74253	0	a	>Yeah, intelligent animals should be capable of either spontaneously, or after training,  Not spontaneously. This is perhaps a little non intuitive to us but think of it this way:  if I stuck my leg out behind me, how would an animal automatically know what was meant?  Also imagine there’s no object immediately in the path of my leg.  This is what makes dogs so special. Through tens of thousands of years of natural selection and hundreds of years of artificial selection, we have bred one of the only species known and demonstrated to have both [context-dependent memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-dependent_memory) and the ability to infer some meaning without a context present. I’ll give you an example:  In one of the studies referenced in these comments, the human would look in the direction of a cup that did not have food. The dogs follow the eyes not their own senses because they associate the human eye movement with something of importance *to the human*.  There’s a lot going on here but basically they’ve made an abstract connection that doing what’s important for the human is inherently rewarding more so than doing something for themselves.  In other words, they innately trust our instincts more than their own.  fMRI imaging has proven that this is, in fact, hard-wired into their brains.
74254	0	a	I imagine with deliberate training, yes, given that dogs are more-or-less direct descendants of them. Blows my mind we took wolves and made some into tiny chihuahuas, poor little mutant bastards...

74258	0	a	We took a cousin of the wolf and bred it. We know that dog’s ancestors were wolves but not which wolves they were.  These are North American wolves. They almost certainly were domesticated from the wolves on other continents.  As they were domesticated during the ice age they travelled with Native American ancestors across the land bridge.  I wouldn’t feel too bad for the chihuahua. They’re actually anatomically correct and optimally designed for the scorching heat of central Mexico. (Small, not fat, and no coat means no excessive warmth) People who don’t live in extremely hot climates who own them are the only problem chihuahuas have.... instead... Feel bad for bulldogs.
74259	0	a	Even in colder climates they can be fine. They're usually indoor dogs, so they can sleep in heated houses/apartments, and many owners will put them in sweaters when it's cold outside. It varies from dog to dog, but some like sweaters (my parents Dachshund loves them - he's the center of attention the whole time, he has no concept of *dignity* he just wants scratches).  I feel worse for cold weather breeds in warmer climates. You can always bundle a warm weather dog up, you can't shave a cold weather breed.
74260	0	a	I'd be willing to bet the wolves won't do this.  Dogs have been living with humans for around 30,000 years - many thousands of generations, and subject to both deliberate and unconscious selective breeding. At this point, they are as highly specialized to interact with humans effectively as orchids are adapted to their pollinator species. 
74261	0	a	The University of Lincoln did a study similar to this years ago  http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2016/01/1185.asp   ..  ~~I would say this also demonstrates dogs move their face in direct response to human attention~~  edit: The Lincoln University study didn't actually study dogs expressions *towards* humans, it showed that dogs react *to* humans expressions. That was my mistake and I mis-read the title.

74263	0	a	Could this possibly be because when a thinking organism is focused on something, especially food, they're less likely to show varied facial expressions in general? Rather than this being a specific trait for dogs? The face is used as part of body language and communication between individuals, so there's no reason to use it with something you're not trying to communicate with, especially when you don't want to lose sight of a food source.
74264	0	a	And cats mimic the sound of crying babies when they meow in order to garner attention from humans. These animals have been domesticated for millennia - it should come as no surprise that they have learned to alter their behavior in order to meet their needs. I would hypothesize that the list doesn't stop with dogs and cats either. 
74265	0	a	Some researchers tried an experiment. Have a person unknown to the dog point to a hidden treat and see if the dog will take the hint. There were two upside down bowls and a treat was under one of them. Dogs took the hint from a strange human and the wolves only did as well as 50/50 guesses. 
74266	0	a	We think way longer than 30,000. We already have direct evidence of 50,000. Could likely extend up to 100k. Fun fact, the dingo from Australia was not always wild but was actually a domesticated dog that was left by humans and started to reintegrate into the wild. 
74267	0	a	"From the study:  >To date there is no systematic experimental evidence, however, that facial expressions in species other than primates, are produced with similar sensitivity to the attention of the audience.  The study you're citing, while related and super cool, did not demonstrate that dog facial expressions are produced with sensitivity to attention of audience (or, as I put it above ""move their faces in direct response to human attention""). That study demonstrated that dogs can recognize emotions in humans...I don't think they even studied dog facial expressions made TOWARD humans.   "
74268	0	a	"Well, there are quite a few studies comparing dogs with tame wolves (raised as pets from birth), which you would expect to display the same behaviors since dogs are basically wolves 2.0.  It's fascinating how dogs and wolves are markedly different when it comes to communicating with humans, and it seems to be a genetic difference. In a study comparing tame wolves and dogs, the dogs would look to their owners for clues while the wolves instead looked away and sniffed the ground. The wolves also didn't respond to a stranger acting aggressively, while the dogs did. I think this is especially interesting considering the humans were only acting, and probably didn't produce any ""aggression hormones"" for the wolves to pick up on.  http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(13)00066-X/abstract  I guess unless we can teach dogs to speak it's impossible to know if their communication is just very well-learned conditioning, but the science points toward there being something more than just ""human = food = good."""
74269	0	a	"I think I know the one you're talking about. The one experiment they did about problem solving/ ""asking"" for help was pretty interesting. I don't remember the specifics but Basically when a dog can't figure out how to solve a puzzle/problem they look to the human in the room for help. In the same example, a wolf just got exceedingly angry and never turned to the human"
74270	0	a	I'm no dog biology expert, however, shouldn't a dog or wolf's sense of smell be able to clue them in on the location of the treat? Was that accounted for in this study you mention? I am genuinely curious.
74271	0	a	I saw one where they attached a big piece of meat to a wooden board, attached a rope to that, put it inside of a cage and then had the other end of the rope coming out of the cage. The wolf grabbed the end of the rope and wildly yanked it over and over again. The meat got yanked over but since it was attached to the board he couldn't get it out of the cage. He tried over and over to the point where he was getting violent. They tried it with a dog. The dog pulled the rope and when the meat didn't come out, the dog gave up and looked up to the human. That amused me so much!
74272	0	a	I’m pretty sure they controlled for scent, otherwise it would be pretty useless.   I remember seeing a documentary showing how this is one thing dogs can do that other primates can’t, which is learn from teamwork with a human. In the documentary a chimp couldn’t connect pointing with the correct bowl for a treat, but the dogs could do it instinctively.   Apparently chimps and whatnot can learn by copying actions they see (lift a bowl and get a treat) but they can’t follow and understand abstract instructions from a human very well (pointing = pay attention to what is being pointed at). Dogs on the other hand have evolved to understand human instructions and compliment human actions, so they are much better at working with a human instead of just learning what a human does and performing the same action themselves.
74273	0	a	That's the one! It's really interesting

74276	0	a	Depends on how you define natural though. Ants farm aphids. They carry them up into trees, protect them from predators, and eat the honeydew they produce. Over generations, the aphids trend to produce more or sweeter honeydew. This is similar behavior to humans domesticating goats for milk, the only difference is how long they've been up to it. You wouldn't call aphid farming an unnatural symbiosis even if they'd only been doing it for a few hundred years, so we're left with whether or not the breeding selection was conscious or not. The human mind is amazingly self centered, and we tend to think of ourselves as being entirely different from other species in the sense that if we did something comparable it's somehow special or different when in reality we're just really smart, well adapted apes.
74277	0	a	Doesn't a pod basically represent a pack of cigarettes? Why wouldn't it have the same amount of nicotine? 
74278	0	a	This is gonna get buried but I use to work for a very prominent manufacturer of e cigarette juices. Helped build two of their manufacturing environments. I still remember when we heard about juul pods and reading through their patents.  I don't want to go in to too much detail but basically, average vape dudes will vape 3-6mg. Juul pods are often 50 mg. If you tried to run 50mg in a traditional vape (yes its higher temp often which makes a difference) you'd cough up a lung. How does juul do it? Nicotine salts.  Read their patents and you'll see what they are doing and why juul is so addictive. It's not the fruity taste or the ease of delivery, it's the amount of nicotine you are able to ingest and with such ease and speed. Cigarettes don't compare, I can't tell you how many occasional smokers I have seen go into full nicotine addiction after a few days with a few days with a juul. 
74279	0	a	I'm not sure it's even legal to sell ones with nicotine to minors...... 
74280	0	a	For UK people this doesn't affect us, the higher doses are only legal in the us, TPD compliance and all that 
74281	0	a	Every pack says a pod has as much nicotine as a whole pack of smokes 
74282	0	a	Maybe I’m pretty ignorant, but isn’t nicotine on its own not as addicting as having it combined with MAOI like in traditional cigarettes?
74283	0	a	I think people are significantly overstating some of these stories. I used a Juul daily for almost a year and did it in my office so it was literally all day and went through a pod every few days. I was definitely addicted to nicotine. Quit a couple weeks ago cold turkey and have had cravings off and on but it really wasn’t that bad. Obviously, everyone is different but some of these stories are making the stuff sound like meth. 
74284	0	a	Wouldn’t that be highly addictive to anyone? What teen doesn’t know about nicotine?
74285	0	a	Good for me since I’m using it to quit smoking. 2 weeks strong and hoping to ween off this in the next few weeks
74286	0	a	This is correct.
74287	0	a	Vaping used to be touted as a viable way to quit smoking because you could dial down nicotine content.
74288	0	a	This was my understanding too, that in order to justify the cost, they had to make it equal to a pack of cigarettes, otherwise a smoker would just buy a pack of cigarettes 
74289	0	a	Nicotine causes a release of dopamine, along with relaxing your body and increasing your ability to concentrate.   HOWEVER...those effects only last for approximately 20 minutes max, and then you're back at baseline. If you do nicotine only once in a while (lets say once a month), then your return to baseline is painless and you move on with your life.    If you do nicotine habitually (for instance, every day), then your body builds a tolerance to these effects, and your baseline ends up getting lower and lower. Your normal state is slightly dopamine deprived, physically/emotionally tense, stressed, and unable to sit still or concentrate, along with being in a state where its easy to be triggered into a bad mood. Take a couple hits and you'll get the little rush and return to your *pre addiction* baseline.   You take the nicotine just to feel normal, instead of to feel better than normal.    Edit: It's the standard, everyday, run-of-the-mill addiction profile.  Edit: ive been informed nicotine also spikes you adrenaline, which probably what contributes to the increase in ability to concentrate and focus immediately after smoking. But too much adrenaline also contributes to anxiety and tension.    Edit: nicotine also interferes with the digestive system, though im not certain how.    It also affects the body's ability to process sugars, and how the body uses insulin. Diabetics beware, nicotine will cause sharp spikes in blood sugar.    Edit: ah! Nicotine poisoning. Ugh, dont ever smoke like 5 cigarettes on your first night of smoking. 8 hours of hell. Stomach cramps, moderate/severe nausea, slamming headache, general malaise, bodily unrest and soreness, ridiculous amounts of tension in your body. Feeling like the fucking black death for like 8 hours until spontaneously your body has gotten rid of it all and all of a sudden you feel pretty much fine (if somewhat tired because you were up all night feeling like death itself)

74295	0	a	"Yes.  In addition, previous research stated that the vaporised nicotine from vaping was transferred to blood less efficiently than in cigarette smoking due to being encapsulated in larger aerosol particles which were more difficult to uptake in the lungs. Combined with the fact that vaping doesn't have the same short term effect on heart rate, this essentially means the ""rush"" associated with smoking is *significantly* reduced.  This ""rush"" is an important component to addiction, similar to that observed in smoked freebase or ""crack"" cocaine vs insufflated cocaine powder, the former having far greater and more rapid onset habituation risk."
74296	0	a	Tell that to my ENTIRE high school of about 1800 students... almost all of them have juuls
74297	0	a	For most non juul users, it is.  They key is to have options when buying your ejuice so that you can get higher/lower nicotine levels as needed.  It seems like this (Edit)company's strategy is to get people hooked though.  I was never tempted because its obscenely expensive compared to other vape products, but the ease of use and accessibility attracted quite a few people  Edit(2, thanks koala_steak): some comments have informed me that juul pods come in 3 or 5% options.  After some research I've found that this is done by weight of their eliquid. When you can choose your own ejuice, you can often have a wide variety in nicotine levels (0, 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, + mg/ml) where with juul you get either a 40 or 60 mg/ml choice.  sauce .

Earlier vapes used freebase nicotine which had all of the problems you mentioned above, more modern ones, like juul, use nicotine salts which actually get to your brain faster and in higher concentrations that traditional cigarettes. Basically, the newer generations of vapes have the ""rush"" in spades."
74306	0	a	Yeah I think the big issue is the perception that juuls and equivalent vapes are totally unharmful. I used to smoke a pack of Marlboro lights a day, sometimes if I had a stressful day, or if I went out for drinks I'd dip into a second pack. Switching to juul I go through about a pod a day, usually a little less. Obviously a pod a day juul habit is still not healthy, but I feel way better than when I was going through a pack of smokes a day.   The problem now is we're seeing people who never really had a nicotine addiction, and would only occasionally smoke cigarettes (or for some of the teens using them, never smoked cigarettes) getting started on juuls and because of the ease, convenience and general social acceptability developing the equivalent of a pack a day nicotine habit.

Is it just an outlet for emotion, or is there more to it?
74319	0	a	I hope this post doesn’t get buried. I’m working on my degree in psychology and am working on a dissertation around this idea.  People are going to be attracted music that conveys an emotion they feel because, well, they need to feel that emotion. Often times depressed people feel bad about feeling sad and then get stuck in a negative thought cycle about feeling sad. But we need to feel what we feel, so we’re going to be attracted to music that lets us feel it. It’s calming because on some level that part is getting a voice.

Sadness in our culture is generally directing us to consider loss or that which is missing in our lives. Extremely useful for highlysocial primates.   To fully integrate an emotion and understand what is needed (and thus move on), it helps to consider that loss/longing. However, if we don't have anyone to do that with we might spend time alone to ponder and consider our options. There have been studies that show isolation might be just that and depression might be an evolutionary ""emergency brake"" to help conserve our resources and to stop making potentially harmful choices (I.e. why keep going to this school/work/social event that makes me feel like a incapable/horrible/threatened/inferior person).   When I work with parents and teens around depression and sadness, I frame it like this: wallowing is self-pity and potentially destructive; during alone time choose to ""marinate"" instead.

I was depressed for a very long time but could feel other things while thinking everything sucks, just nothing over came the underlying sad thoughts.

The scientists asked participants to relive their most shameful experiences of decades ago while making MRI scans of their brain activity. While good sleepers literally settled those experiences in their head as neutralized memories, people with insomnia were not able to do so. This breakthrough finding suggests that insomnia could primarily be caused by a failing neutralization of emotional distress. Which makes it understandable that insomnia is the primary risk factor for the development of disorders of mood, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. The findings were published on 25 April in the leading scientific journal Brain.  MALADAPTIVE SLEEP It is a well-known fact that sleep helps us to remember important experiences. But sleep is also essential for getting rid of the emotional distress that may have occurred during those experiences. Both these overnight processes involve changes in the connections between brain cells: some become stronger and consolidate memories, whereas others are weakened and get rid of unwanted associations. “Sayings like ‘sleeping on it’ to ‘get things off your mind’ reflect our nocturnal digestion of daytime experiences. Brain research now shows that only good sleepers profit from sleep when it comes to shedding emotional tension. The process does not work well in people with insomnia. In fact, their restless nights can even make them feel worse” says first author Rick Wassing.  https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awz089/5477778

74333	0	a	**Summary:** The authors used MRI in insomnia disorder (n = 27) and normal sleepers (n = 30) to identify how brain activation differs between new and re-lived emotions. They evaluated whether brain activity elicited by re-living emotional memories from the distant past resembles the activity from new emotional experiences more in insomnia disorder than in normal sleepers. In normal sleepers, re-living of shameful experiences from the past did not elicit a limbic response (limbic system is an area of the brain controlling emotional expression). In contrast, participants with insomnia disorder used overlapping parts of the limbic circuit, during both new and relived shameful experiences.

74335	0	a	Yep, but it's good to see studies being done to confirm the association, rather than it being anecdotal.
74336	0	a	Yeah, some people might have but I was never able to piece it together or put it into words like that. Most people say things are obvious after reading about it. (Hindsight: 20/20)
74337	0	a	I feel like this is backwards, I feel like it's not being an insomniac that causes this ,but instead this is a cause of insomnia

74339	0	a	"I am fine with the association but this article tries to frame it like causation and flip-flops on the direction of the causation without batting an eye:  >insomnia could primarily be caused by a failing neutralization of emotional distress.   ok, so distress could cause insomnia  >But sleep is also essential for getting rid of the emotional distress  ok, so now it's insomnia that causes distress  >Brain research now shows that only good sleepers profit from sleep when it comes to shedding emotional tension. The process does not work well in people with insomnia. In fact, their restless nights can even make them feel worse  again they claim insomnia causes distress  >But if they listened once more after a good night’s sleep, they didn’t feel that distressed about it anymore. They had literally got the distress off their minds. At least: good sleepers did. After a restless night, people with insomnia were in fact even more upset about it.  citing another research that showed insomnia impaired relief of distress  Conclusion:  >The new findings show that causes of insomnia are probably rather found in brain circuits that regulate emotions  again, reversal. It's not that lack of good sleep impaires shedding distress it's that people's faulty emotional processing causes insomnia. But if they say ""probably"" then they're ok with making unfounded claims I guess.  and two lines down  >Without the benefits of sound sleep, distressing events of decades ago continue to activate the emotional circuits of the brain as if they are happening right now  I hate the way science is reported."
74340	0	a	"It is a proven fact that sleep is essential in ""putting to rest"" past emotional memories (and this study provides more evidence for this). If you have insomnia for other reasons, this is one of the _many_ things in your body and mind that will be sabotaged. That may of course compound the issue as you say, and an after-the-fact study can't confirm the direction of causality, but the ""bad sleep causes too little detachment from past memories"" is a known thing."
74341	0	a	A few facts about the 2014 Mexican soda tax.  Sources: Euromonitor, Canadean, BMJ, Mexican National Institute of Public health.  - That 6% number comes from a study that was done in 2015, and only tells you what happened in 2014 itself - the year the tax went into effect - Carbonated soft drinks (e.g. Coke) declined only 1.7% - The main hit was on non-carbonated sweetened beverages (declined 17%) - stuff like juice, gatorade, etc. - Total demand for soft drinks was back to 2013 levels by 2016.  Growth trajectory for soft drinks resumed previous trend as soon as 2015 - Diet soft drinks got an immediate boost in 2014 (though they are still a small part of the market) - Lots of people seemed to switch to smaller pack sizes (e.g. 12oz cans instead of liter bottles), because the tax was imposed on a per-liter basis.  So rather than buy big bottles, people bought more, small cans, because the price of each can went up less. - I'm not sure what happened to non-carbonated sugary beverages past 2014, but I believe they kept growing despite the tax  So what did we learn?  - The Mexican government loves to tout this as a win, though the lasting effect is pretty unclear - The effect was very short lived on many types of beverages, including soda - This didn't really affect Coke or Pepsi much at all, since soda drinkers seemed to either keep drinking it, switch to cans, or buy diet soda.  What it did do was kill off competition from other beverage types. - People who are very price sensitive down to the centavo (likely poorer people) seemed to switch to packages with less expensive taxes imposed, though it's not clear their total consumption declined  So I'm not sure what to say about this tax.  I don't think you can really call it a win for public health, because the lasting effect is not really clear.  People certainly aren't drinking any less soda, but they are probably drinking a bit less other sugary drinks like juice.  I'm a bit concerned that this was sort of a regressive tax whose burden fell heavily on poor people.  That said, I'm personally all for taxing vice.  But as with everything, the truth on the ground is way more complicated than the theory.
74342	0	a	Am I blind, or is this article about a sugar tax so poorly written that they don't tell you what % the tax was?  If anyone cares to know, it's 10% [according to this article](http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/24849-tax-on-sugar-sweetened-beverages-in-mexico-is-expected-to-reduce-obesity-diabetes).
74343	0	a	While I agree that sugar consumption is a huge health problem, I'm not sure I agree with the government imposing sin taxes to dissuade consumption.   Edit: to everyone commenting about Pigovian taxes, medical costs, etc passed on to the public I would like to remind them that sugar(HFCS) is extremely inexpensive due to government subsidies on corn.  A tax on sugar would be a tax on an item we give the producers a tax break on.   Corn is cheap and plentiful due to subsidies found in the farm bill, excess corn is turned into HFCS, which makes it into cheap highly palpable foods.   Additionally, the US government spent the last 50 years telling people to not eat fat or salt. Food tastes terrible without salt, fat, or sugar. So cheap HFCS is added.    Maybe we'd all be better off if the government just stayed out of the way.

74404	0	a	That's not necessarily true. I've been with my wife for something like 17 years. We've never been through a time like that. 
74405	0	a	"I'm not OP, but I've been with the love of my life for 11 years, living together for 8 of those years, and I love them more now than I probably did when all of this began.   So... one of my biggest pieces of advice is you need to let that person be your best friend. It's the two of you against the world, so let them in like your confidante and be stupid with them. You have to be your truest self, not who you think they want, and if they let you be that person and love you, you've found someone golden.   Also, you have to TRUST that person. Trust is earned, but once it IS earned... let them be free. The person you love is a whole other individual with wants and needs, just like you, and you have to communicate with them and make sure they're fulfilled and happy and ok with where they are. Let them go out with friends without looking through their phone, or demanding to know when they'll be home. Give them space and allow them to be THEM without being up their ass all the time and trying to insert yourself in every part of their life. Trust them.  You must also be generous with your partner. I'm not talking BIG things like gifts and money... I'm talking little things, like taking care of them really well when they're sick. Rubbing their back when they're tired. Giving them support after a long day... always being ready to negotiate and compromise. This is, of course, a two-way street. YOU don't do these things all yourself. The BOTH of you do this together.   But I think the most important and hardest thing to learn is effective communication. You will get PISSED at each other. No one can hurt you like the one you love the most, and when they do, holy shit does it HURT and make you FURIOUS. It can be over something really small and stupid, but goddamn you can get MAD, especially after many years together if it's a repeat offense or pet peeve. This type of shit can tear people apart, people who have loved each other for a LONG time... there is a kind of way to... remove yourself from the emotions of the situation, swallow your pride, explain to your partner why you are upset, talk about it fairly and calmly as best you can, and then move on. This is hard because it requires both people to be able to talk and communicate even when upset. Sometimes you need to take a break before you can talk, and that's ok... but don't be petty, don't hold a stupid grudge, and don't go to bed angry. And even if you feel like you're in the right, they might reveal something you did that hurt them too. You can't act like it's a me-vs-them power trip. You have to be able to say, ""You're right. I'm sorry. That was wrong."" TALK to your loved one. If they are worth it, they will talk to you too, no matter the stress of the situation. It is IMPORTANT to remember things like ""I love this person"" even when you're SUPER PISSED. Also, both of you have to know and allow that sometimes people say things they don't mean. I'm not talking abusive, horrible shit... but in any fight, hurtful things get said. Forgive each other. Hug each other. Snuggle and watch a movie and remember all the reasons you love each other after those moments. This is one of the HARDEST things. Sometimes you have to be the bigger person and swallow your pride. It's worth it, because when that person loves you, they will reciprocate and it will be OK in the end.   One final thing-- they say opposites attract, and I think it's true about personalities, because my love and I have different personalities that ""balance"" each other out. For example, I'm very shy and he's not, so he encourages me out of my comfort zone. I'm very methodic and thoughtful with my preparations, he likes to charge in and do things like a bull in a china shop, so I slow him down and help balance him that way... BUT... I think it's so important to have things in common. We share a lot of favorite movies, TV shows, music, etc. and in that way we are really like best friends getting excited about the same things. Going on road trips and enjoying music together (we take turns, we don't love ALL the same music, just some). It is WORK and balance and compromise.   It is a CHOICE to love someone through thick and thin. When they are at their worst, you have to choose to help them through and see past it, and them for you. This whole ""if you love someone, it should be easy, this shouldn't happen, blah blah blah"" that's all CRAP. That's all rom-com bullshit. It is NOT easy, but it is absolutely worth it and amazing and wonderful if you CHOOSE to put the work in, to swallow your pride, to compromise, to support, etc.   I hope this helps in some way. Remember, all of this advice is not one-sided. You must do these things, and SO MUST THEY. Also, the advice about ""seeing someone at their worst"" i.e... stuck in traffic, losing their car keys, losing their patience over something small... you NEED to see those sides of someone in order to know if you can  really love all of this person, good and bad. No masks, no acts. "
74406	0	a	"Not sure what that is but to me the concept is actually pretty natural... I think great relationships work when you just have that unspoken understanding of one another. It's not really something you can make happen, it just happens through learning to read each other. I swear the majority of failed relationships I've witnessed were because they just didn't have that unspoken connection.  My parents have been together over 40 years now and they have gone through great times, rough times, depressing times, stressful times, wonderful times etc. The thing is, through all that, they always seem to just instinctively KNOW how to encourage or comfort or help each other out. They just KNOW when to push each other or back off or make the other one laugh or when the other just needs some tough love or time to think.  I remember one time a few years ago, my dad had just lost his job of 20+ years and was super depressed and trying to find work... he set his wallet down on the table and a little laminated ace of spades card was sticking out of it. I asked him why he had a playing card in his wallet. He said ""your mother put it in there this morning so I'd remember even though my 20 year career is gone, all that job experience is the ace in my pocket"" and he teared up a bit. He went out that week and applied to countless jobs, eventually got one and is doing great now but he still carries that card in his wallet. My mom just instinctively KNEW how to make one little gesture that would help my dad push through tough times."
74407	0	a	I totally thought it all sounded like bullshit too, until it expanded communications in my relationship like a freaking flood gate had opened. Literally saved our relationship. We just learned we had very different languages and weren't seeing what the other person meant when they did certain things. Annnnnd now we know better. 
74408	0	a	"When I was a kid, my dad spent a great deal of time explaining love to my sister and I through quotes like ""you marry for love, you stay together for companionship"" and as a kid it bothered me. He didn't want us believing in this stupid idea that you have only one true love and that they will fulfill you entirely forever just the way you feel now.   He was honest about love. He explained that he loves my mom very much, but that it's entirely different from that first rush. What he feels is deeper and more akin to the love you feel for a parent or a sibling. It's still romantic at times, sure, but the foundation of a lasting marriage isn't built on flowers and eating strawberries on the beach at sunset. Those things are nice, but the foundation is about living a life together. Building a solid trust with one another and learning to respect and trust that that person will have your back. It's more of a partnership.   I fought this notion in my youth, I wanted the flowery love. Though, both my sister and I married men that outwardly aren't winners, but who we could see doing the hard things with. Taxes, kids, careers, household BS, etc.   Teaching kids what makes a real lasting relationship is important. My dad didn't learn it from his parents (both married 3-4 times) but he did make sure to share what he learned the hard way for our betterment. "

74410	0	a	I find it amazing that couples *don't* have these conversations all the time.  I've been with my husband for 17 years and we talk all the time.  Constantly.  About everything.  We've become very much alike because we discuss things and see each other's view points and then end up molding and genuinely agreeing with each other about practically everything (except music which is our #1 area where we veer off.) I cannot imagine being in a relationship where certain conversations are awkward or uncomfortable or just not happening.  This is the person you are supposed to be closest to in life and *want* to confide in all the time.  If that's not happening, that's something to think about and change.
74411	0	a	>Not sure what that is but to me the concept is actually pretty natural... I think great relationships work when you just have that unspoken understanding of one another. It's not really something you can make happen, it just happens through learning to read each other. I swear the majority of failed relationships I've witnessed were because they just didn't have that unspoken connection.  I've got to call you out on this. This kind of thinking is what accounts for a lack of effort in relationships, and for allowing them to fail. Relationships aren't some mysterious, mystical thing where if you don't telepathically know what the other needs or wants it's going to fail. I'd put money on it that some of those good relationships you've seen like that got there because they put work into it. Yes, people can have that kind of connection, but no, it isn't some whimsical unspoken thing. That kind of understanding can be and often is forged through communication.
74412	0	a	It comes from paying attention to your spouse. I don't mean listening to them, I mean spending your life with them and introspectively evaluating the things they say and do (and the things they **don't** say and **don't** do) and understanding them as a complex individual.

74438	0	a	Welcome to the club dude! I got mine last year and I was so happy to finally have finished. Not many people make it that far so congratulations, and trust me all the hard work you put in will pay off for the rest of your life
74439	0	a	Congrats buddy! What does that mean to you?
74440	0	a	Congratulations brother! I got mine back in 2012 and I met a gentleman this weekend that got his way back in 1936 I believe. You've put in the work, welcome! 
74441	0	a	it is a shame that the Boy Scouts don't teach ironing. 
74442	0	a	Yeah, about that lost the badges themselves just had the few that I had for my board of review, ill have the rest for the court of honor.
74443	0	a	A local play ground was being washed out every time it rained so we put in water breaks as well as cleaned up the nearby woods
74444	0	a	How does it contribute to the rest of your life? 
74445	0	a	Oh man, I got that same question on the board of review and didnt know what to say.
74446	0	a	That's what my girlfriend's mother said.
74447	0	a	Great job, fellow Eagle!  Pair that up with a meaningful neckerchief and you'll be amazing.  I opened a keepsake box I had when I moved recently and found my first scout handbook.  It was a really emotional experience and one of those items that I don't think I will ever part with.  CONGRATULATIONS! YOU EARNED IT!
74448	0	a	It looks good on your resume, make sure to play up the leadership, teambuilding, and discipline aspects. People love that, throw in responding to unusual situations and intelligent decision making and you can sell yourself pretty well. 
74449	0	a	Sounds like a good project for the community. I still need to finish a few of the eagle merit badges and do my project but I'm almost there
74450	0	a	I have personally received interviews because I had it on my resume. Companies love it. Current job came from having that stand out on my resume. No idea that is would help as much as it did when I got it. 
74451	0	a	Welcome to the club! Enjoy the times you spent working to get it with your friends and always remember, be prepared. 
74452	0	a	Professionally, It has made zero difference for me over the past 30 years.   YMMV. 
74453	0	a	How much time do you have left? Also, a good place to get projects from is the local water and sewer department, they always have things that need to be done.
74454	0	a	"Interesting. I have never once put it on a resume or application for anything since I graduated college.  Not that I regret earning my Eagle, I just don't see that it does as much good in ""the real world"" as people told me it would."
74455	0	a	Fellow Eagle here: It's only ever made a difference for me with college jobs. Once I graduated college and got into Engineering, no one gave two shits. It might (just might) help you on your first entry level position but my experience is that networking and desirable skills are 90% of that battle...  That being said though, it's an accomplishment for OP that should be celebrated. I don't engage with The BSA anymore for political reasons but any individual who earns it deserves celebration. 
74456	0	a	I turned 16 in June so I have about 2 years left, and thanks for the advice I'll definitely look into that 
74457	0	a	For people who enlist in the military having eagle scout in their background jumps them up to E3 upon exiting boot camp, if I recall. Something to do with the discipline and training accrued. Same as if a college graduate enlists. 
74458	0	a	Yep, still happened. It's almost like we were in different troops. Hmm...
74459	0	a	It's real easy to let those last two years fly by and not take care of them until the last minute - don't do that. That's how you end up assembling metal structures in subzero temperatures just so you can squeak in your project before you turn 18 like I did. You can do it!

74464	0	a	My hometown is gripped with meth addiction. I don’t live there anymore, but I follow the local paper and keep up with what’s going on. When I see a blurb about an arrest, I’d guess that probably 8/10 have possession of meth listed as one of the charges. It’s a horrible addiction and it ruins so many lives, so anytime I hear about someone getting free of that mess, it makes me really happy. Congratulations to you and all the best to you and your family!

74473	0	a	Sorry if this is incredibly rude, so feel free not to answer, but I’m from a country that doesn’t have any form of meth problem, so I have a few questions!  What drew you to try meth? My only knowledge of it is that it’s crazy addictive and bad for you, so even if presented the opportunity I don’t think I’d try it! And is it similar to smoking, in that the situation where you might get peer pressured into trying it is likely to arise, or do you pretty much have to go out your way to be in a position to try it?  How rapidly did your lifestyle change, or was it gradual?  And lastly, what convinced you to get clean?  Again, feel free to not answer any, I’m just intrigued given that I have no awareness about it at all!  And well done on getting clean!! You look much better for it!

74499	0	a	For years, I coached cheerleading for a non-profit youth league. Every year, I and a couple other parents would personally pay for at least half of my Cheerleaders’ league fees. $175 isn’t a lot, but to some it was more than they could save up in a year. Some families had multiple kids cheering and playing football, but could not afford to pay the fees, so we would. We did it because we knew that this was the ONLY activity outside of going to school for most of these kids.   My last year coaching cheer, one of my regular families, that was very poor and could never pay the fees for their 4 kids, hit a windfall by inheritance. It wasn’t a huge inheritance by any means, but they came to me and donated $10,000 to our team for extra scholarships. They said it was because they wanted to pay our kindness forward.   It’s people like them and people like you that make doing what I did worthwhile. THANK YOU for being the light those kids and families need in the darkness. 
74500	0	a	This a wonderful gift to future kids.  Well done!
74501	0	a	Dude. You have made this world a better place. Thank you
74502	0	a	Hell yeah, that's awesome man.  I do a similar thing. I'm 28 and I've skateboarded since I was 6. At first my brother gave me his old skateboards, and then he grew out of it, but I never did. Older dudes at the skatepark always gave me their old decks, trucks, or whatever they weren't using. Now, as an adult with a real job, I give kids skateboards that still have tons of life in them. I'm also pooling money together with two other friends to buy like 10 complete skateboards for this group of kids at the park that reminds me of me and me my friends when we were their age (probably all about 12-14).  It feels good to do good things. I was a heroin addict for the last 13 years, clean now, and this is my way of giving back to the one thing that was always there for me. 
74503	0	a	I spent many years umpiring. It’s a pretty thankless job and the only reason I kept up with it was the good pay.   You are a hero for everything you’ve done in your community and on the ballpark. Keep being awesome.
74504	0	a	"You've experienced first hand the pride I'm feeling I. Being able to help. It's an incredible thing.  EDIT: Highjacking top comment.   Wow, no idea this would touch so many people and it's truly humbling. Wanted to answer a couple of questions.  Donations/Scholarship: I used the word ""scholarship"" a bit liberally. It's a fund I set up with the Little League I umpire for to help out kids get gear or cover any expenses that Little League doesnt cover. The national organization will cover fees for kids whose parents qualify for free lunch programs but folks making just above that have a tough time, particularly with multiple kids, to pay fees or afford gear. I want to help fill that gap. It's an honor you want to donate to my cause but I would highly suggest taking any money you want to give me and invest in your local community. If we all do a little in our communities its makes for a better country overall and we all need more to bring us together these days.  How do become an umpire: Contact your local Little League and they will set you on a path. Usually a couple weeks before the start of the season multiple Leagues will get together and conduct training. Be warned, you'll probably have to put $100+ into gear to get started.  Bert Kreischer: I've been stopped on the street and asked if I was him. At airports multiple times I've had people yell ""The machine!!!"" at me.   Anyone can do what I've done in their corner of the world with things that make them happy. I love baseball and what it's done for me and having the ability to give back is one of the best feelings I've ever experienced. There is a lot of shit and ugly in the world but if those who are able to help do so, we will all be better for it. With that in mind, if you're able please join the bone marrow registry.

74513	0	a	Awesome. Did you get out of depression by yourself or did you use professional help?
74514	0	a	Hey guys, I know there are many people - even a good number reading this right now - who are in distress.  So, any of you who is feeling legitimately down and in great enough distress that they're in jeopardy of taking actions they may regret, **[read this](http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/)**. Please don't lose hope. Your lives are worth too much.  Additionally, here is the number to the U.S.'s National Suicide Hotline: tel:1-800-273-TALK, along with numbers for other countries [here](http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html), and for those who aren't comfortable talking - [a text line.](http://www.crisistextline.org/get-help-now/)  Due to the prevalence of depression, it's quite likely that most of you know someone who's depressed. So in case the situation comes up, here are some techniques describing [speaking to suicidal persons online,](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCompliments/comments/5nw2zf/some_guidelines_for_approaching_posters_who_are/) in case the situation ever arises.  And if you happen to know of anyone who's suffering, feel free to share these with them and use the techniques described above. It can be the difference between a single irreversible decision and saving someone's life before they endanger it.

74530	0	a	Great job!
74531	0	a	Consistent weight lifting, proper nutrition, high protien intake, and low intensity steady state cardio. I would do heavy compound lifts (deadlift, squat, bench, over head press)to improve my strength followed by volume auxiliary lifts. I don't eat any processed foods. High carb intake to fuel my workouts. High protien to preserve lean muscle mass. Low intensity cardio, in the 65% heart rate max range burns only fat. High intensity cardio burns carbs. I've focused on getting stronger, but I need to do more volume training. The most important thing is getting into a calorie deficit, 300-500 is best. It's not hard to find. Take your weight in lbs to kg. Then multiply weight in kg by 24. This equals your resting metabolic rate, which is how much your body needs to just lay in bed all day. Take you activity level, light activity 30%, medium 40%, high 50% etc.. and add that to your rmr to get maintenance calories. Then take 300 to 500 calories off for weight loss. So if I weigh 90 kg it would look like this. 90×24=2160. 2160×.5=1080. 2160+1080=3240. 3240 would be my maintenance calories.

74537	0	a	100%. Prior to my injury I was about to graduate with my BSN (Nursing) and learned from my clinicals that patients who have chronic injuries or illnesses know themselves better than I would. For instance, I was placing an IV for a man that was a heroin addict and he knew where all his good veins were.  Now, I've changed my major now, still in healthcare though. I want to become a Physical Therapist. I would love to work in neurorehabilitation, I feel like I have an understanding of a different level of brain injuries than just what academics teach.
74538	0	a	It's rather boring in comparison to other peoples injuries. I tripped and fell head first on the ground. Ended up crushing my face and brain haha the actual diagnosis was a shit ton subdermal hematomas and an anoxic brain injury.   Wish it was a more exciting story.

74555	0	a	Eagle is the highest rank any Boy Scout in America can achieve. It's an extremely hard thing to obtain. It requires the completion of 13 specific merit badges and 8 others. These badges can be easy such as Reading merit badge or as hard as Life-saving/Wilderness survival. It also is a large time commitment. While it only requires you to be in scouting for 1 1/2-2 years (they changed requirements after I got eagle so I'm a bit rusty) it normally takes longer. Another huge part of being an Eagle is the leadership/project one must complete. I built a trail and a picnic bench for mine. Others have built sheds and gazebo's, however it doesn't have to be building alot of people do campaigns or activity based things for a public cause. Because of this commitment it's held at a high standard and it's great for college and job applications. Also ik in the military, idk about police, you automatically become an E-3 (Private First Class) which is the rank one achieves with a Associates degree (60 college credits) also only 4/5 out of 100 boyscouts get this rank so it's kind of exclusive.

74558	0	a	Eagle projects are no joke. They take a lot of time and effort. Props. 
74559	0	a	For what it's worth, and other's mileage my vary on this opinion, I made it to life scout, never got Eagle (one of my many regrets), but Marine Corps basic training was easier than getting Eagle.  We had one Eagle scout in my platoon who was immediately assigned to our platoon leader.  Even got promoted to E-3 (Lance Corporal) out of basic.  For all the nay-sayers who will tear me apart, one of the reasons Eagle Scout is so honorable is it requires a tremendous amount of self-motivation, which at the age of 16-17 isn't as easy as being told step by step what to do as a desperate recruit who just wants to become a Marine.  You have to take initiative and be creative.  Hell, unless things have changed, Eagle Scouts have to be creative enough to come up with their own act of community service, and coordinate with many outside entities to actually see it become reality.  Basic just requires you to not screw up terribly, and follow instructions.  It was the Eagle Scout in my platoon that applied what he used to become an Eagle Scout to become the best platoon leader among all 30 or so of us.  I for one am awfully damn proud of you my dude.

74564	0	a	Lemme clear a couple things up because I've seen a few negative comments (which is fine, you're all entitled to say whatever you want, I just want to clarify some things):  1) The majority of people in the audience weren't there specifically to see me. Some were. Nowhere did I say they specifically came to see me. The stage I was on just happened to have this audience in there who stuck around to watch my set.  2) While the camera only picked up the front few rows - Samsung mobile phone, what ya gonna do - it was indeed packed all the way from the front to the back, and was definitely far more than the photo might suggest.  3) I didn't open for anyone and am not claiming for it to have been *my* show. It was a festival. Nobody's show specifically.  Cheers everyone for your positive comments! You're all lovely

74623	0	a	I literally use it as a blanket, its the snuggliest thing I own lol 
74624	0	a	Honestly I haven't really had one specific routine although I am trying to make one! Up until recently I used bio-oil religiously morning and night to get rid of the scarring, which is why people can't really tell it used to be so bad, and i moisturise every single day (not with a specific one, usually simple or something like that as I'm poor lol). I also really like the Peter Thomas Roth pumpkin enzyme facemark which I got a year or so ago when I was in Paris! I think the reason for such a big change is mostly hormones as when I found the right pill there was a massive change within 6 months and it was just scarring from there! 
74625	0	a	My gf has similar problems and has tried almost everything. What did you use? Btw glad it worked so well for you, I’m sure it’s a big boost of confidence. Knowing how embarrassed my gf gets sometimes because of it even though she’s still beautiful, I’d like her to have the same feeling.
74626	0	a	It literally was just hormonal/stress-triggered for me so when I found the right pill (and I did go through a couple of types) it just changed very quickly! When the actual acne had gone I used bio-oil for the scars. Its so specific for everyone and I tried many different things but honestly it was just a fluke that I found something that worked. Just carry on telling her you love her and she's beautiful!   
74627	0	a	Thank you for the insight but do you know the brand of the pill?
74628	0	a	oh sorry I misunderstood! it's Lucette and i'm still on it!

74661	0	a	So...my wife and I struggled for 3 years...infertility treatments...then had a baby boy. Then another one with no treatment 19 months later.   We had a third boy last dec.   It’s been amazing. Congrats on that adorable baby!

74665	0	a	This is amazing! Im very happy you had success with no treatment after! We heard that you can become more fertile after the first and your story gives me hope. We also plan to adopt as well so even if it doesnt happen naturally we will gladly add another bundle of joy. Congrats on your family!
74666	0	a	Oh wow thank you so much. Im quite gullible so i hope this is a genuine thing. If not, thanks for the gesture anyways
74667	0	a	This is actually my husband in the photo! He is 28.
74668	0	a	That's not creepy. Now if they said super cute husband & super hot baby, that would be creepy.
74669	0	a	I think this is well intentioned, but a lot of people who struggle with infertility might find this offensive. Oftentimes, fertility treatments are incredibly invasive, painful, exorbitantly priced, and take a very very long time. People often have no success at all or suffer many losses along the way.   I'm not mad or accusing you of anything, just wanted to let you know.
74670	0	a	Just FYI, this isn't great to say. If you're interested in learning how a lot of women feel: I've been strapped down while catheters are inserted through my cervix so dye or saline can be pumped into my uterus...six times. It's traumatizing, I cry and dry heave each time. Seven miscarriages. Dozens of vaginal ultrasounds. Hundreds of grainy, cold suppositories. Hundreds of painful injections, approaching the thousand mark. My veins are completely blown out, both arms and hands, from bloodwork done at 6:30 am before work. Two major surgeries. I keep my pills in enormous containers because I take 12+ daily. Thousands of pee strip tests. Oh yeah also we spent all the money we were saving for a home! Cool.   Sex is not remotely fun. It's one more scientific thing done to me, and it usually triggers a feeling of helplessness, loss, depression, and fear. Infertility is really hard. And on top of all that...still no baby. And I'm one of the lucky ones because I had a successful one several years ago.
74671	0	a	Wait, 28 is old? Dear God.
74672	0	a	Just adopt at that point....
74673	0	a	Honest question...why not adopt? I mean, you describe an extremely painful/traumatizing process. There are kids out there who need a happy and stable home. I admit I'm ignorant about this and just want to learn about that deep impulse that pushed you to choose to experience all of that.

74705	0	a	I've really always loved working with Special Ed kids for this exact reason. I was a counselor at a Summer Camp one year and was the counselor for the Special Ed campers.  One in particular, Bruce, remains to this day one of the most special kids I've ever met. Every chance he'd get he would come and hug all the counselors and just be very awesome with us.  One day he was getting really irritated by one of the other campers teasing him so I pulled him aside. I told him to close his eyes and began like rubbing my hands together and snapping close to his ears and asked him to imagine a rainstorm, and he began talking to me about how pretty the rain is and how much fun he has in the rain. It was a really, really special moment in my life.

74726	0	a	The hours are obviously greatly different but I was mainly making the same thing day in day out at my current job. Which after 5 years had me feeling very dejected especially as my name went on nothing because the head baker was the face to the company.

74727	0	a	Still an artisan baker but its so much more creative and fulfilling also i would be head baker instead of making things constantly with no recognistion.

Boy Scouts in general though was one of the best things I did growing up, it's worth it to stick with it through Eagle.  It's a lot of work, it's a lot of fun, there's a lot of nonsense hoops to jump through - it's a great intro to adult life.
74732	0	a	Oh man I remember the process of becoming an OA member. Not being allowed to eat or speak during my birthday. Setting up every single canopy tent at good old Boxwell.  Edit: I never got a tent to sleep in. I was tasked with setting up all of the tents at Boxwell.

74737	0	a	OA membership is independent from and not required for the Eagle rank. Its more of a club/ fraternity internal to boy-scouting and is independent of rank.
74738	0	a	As I recall, a large portion of the day was spent not talking at all.
74739	0	a	**Order of the Arrow**  The Order of the Arrow (OA) is the National Honor Society of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). The society was created by E. Urner Goodman, with the assistance of Carroll A. Edson, in 1915 as a means of reinforcing the Scout Oath and the Scout Law. It uses American Indian imagery for ceremonies bestowing recognition on Scouts selected by their peers as best exemplifying the ideals of Scouting. The goal was to establish these as lifelong guidelines and to encourage continued participation in Scouting and camping.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/happy/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27
74740	0	a	A club you need to be voted into by your peers, so more of an honor society.
74741	0	a	Yep, that was one aspect of the ordeal is that we weren't allowed to speak during it. 
74742	0	a	tl;dr: it's not easy to get.   OP, if you're reading this, from one scout to another: good job dude.
74743	0	a	At the time I really didn't understand why, later in life I've realized the value of non-verbal communication while working on a group project.
74744	0	a	hard labor + silence + no food = uncheerful 15 year old me
74745	0	a	it's not, precisely because of how other people have to like you, and kids can be mean to each other. I was a bit of an outsider at that age, for other reasons, so I didn't get voted into it. I did manage to block my nemesis from making it in, though. I don't know why we all didn't vote each other into it, I guess supreme pettiness.  I got practically everything else that I could get though, so it was kind of a bummer, bit of a thorn in my side.
74746	0	a	Yeah, well, show me an aspect of real life that isn't made easier by getting along with your peers

74756	0	a	Seriously they look like completely different women!
74757	0	a	"Thank you everyone-  I never thought this would have such a huge response and it's an incredible feeling!  I have been getting a LOT of questions about how I did it and I am going to do my best to explain everything : - - -   So basically I was at rock bottom.  I was in an emotionally abusive relationship, I was self conscious about my body, I was failing college, no good friends and I had nothing that I was really passionate about.  It really depressed me to imagine living the rest of my life this dissatisfied and unhappy.  I constantly daydreamed about being a different person, and one day I decided I would do what it took to change everything I could.   Usually when things went wrong I would blame everything but myself and it was really important that I went back through some painful life events and reanalyze maybe what I could have done differently.  For example, I blamed my friend for the end of our friendship but looking back I realized I was actually the shitty one and probably deserved for it to end the way it had.  I made a list of the aspects of myself and my life that I wasn't happy with and I was determined to improve.    At this point I had already dropped out of school at my university because of the combination of poor grades, poor attendance, and lack of passion for my major.  I had always wanted to be a nurse but always told myself I was too stupid to try it and that it was way too hard for me.  It scared the shit out of me but I found an accelerated LPN nursing program that was only 12 months (Hondros school of nursing) and I applied for the next available semester.  I worked my ass off studying and sometimes I would drive to class crying my eyes out because I was scared shitless but no matter what - I told myself I would not give up.  And I even failed a semester... But on March 1, 2018 I got my nursing license :-)   Ontop of this, I had to remove all the toxic people out of my life.  Since I was someone with low self esteem and desperate for validation, I had a couple people who were only around me to take full advantage of me and my kindness.  This was difficult, but I had to put myself first and remove them from my life because it was the best thing for ME.  I also gave up drinking and going out to the bars for a while because I knew it would be the best decision overall for me.    It was a lot of faking it because I had always been a pretty negative person.  I just had to force myself to redirect my thinking to positive or just avoid the mirror if I knew I was having a bad day.  I worked really hard on improving my skin and hair as well as my style and makeup routine.  It was a slow process, but it all began to come together.  I had eased up a lot on myself and I started to pick up new hobbies (like painting) as I was learning more about myself and being kinder to myself.    And this is my FAVORITE thing I started doing that really helped improve my life : I got a nice pretty journal and on each page I wrote out a list of 10 goals that I wanted to accomplish that week.  I picked things like ""call mom"" ""go to dinner with Ashlee and enjoy yourself"" ""attend all lectures"" ""clean apartment"" ""50 squats 3 times a week"" ""read 20 pages of a book"" etc.  Just things that I knew would improve my overall life and health.  I made sure that I only wrote down goals that were realistic because if it was on the page- it had to get done that week (if not, I move it to the next page for the next week).  Also, every month I reflect in the journal.    -- Hope this helps!!"

74759	0	a	Pro tip.   Literally never say this out loud within 600 miles of your girlfriend.   
74760	0	a	It looks like current you is giving younger you a hug. 
74761	0	a	Thank you! And yes - I feel SO much better.  The weight loss obviously helped but it was the result of my new mindset. I used to have a LOT of self hatred every single day combined with blaming the universe for why things weren’t working out instead of taking accountability for my actions.   I humbled myself by sitting down and admitting that I was responsible for the shitty life I was currently having and that it was in my control to fix it. I made a gameplan on how I was going to change my situation.   So... I had to cut out ALL the toxic people in my life, I came up with weekly goals that I made sure to complete, and I had to change my thinking to loving myself even though I still hated myself at that point.  As I started to put myself first in life, I learned more about myself and what makes me happy. I picked up hobbies like painting and journaling so that I had a creative outlet (even though it felt so stupid at the time) ... but the truth was I had no coping skills !   I grew up kinda bullied in school for being weird and I had a horrible time making friends. I had to become my own friend and once that happened ... things definitely got better! And now I have a few friendships as people are more attracted to the happier me :-)   - also pushing myself to do Nursing school was huge. I had myself convinced I was way too dumb to ever be a nurse... I had to work my ass off but I’m so glad I took the leap and went for it despite how freaking scary and hard it was!

74764	0	a	Guess what? She knows she needs changes and I was only repeating her words. I'm not the kind of person to judge others, and I definitely don't judge my girlfriend. Whatever she is, she's absolutely perfect for me and I've got her back.  She's depressed with her present situation and I was only hoping things get better for her. Why am I explaining all this to you? You'll not understand, PROBABLY!

I’m just thankful and blessed to be at this place in my life. Addiction is a serious problem, which tends to be made worse by the guilt and shame the addicted feel. Be a friend, don’t enable, but be there. My friends and family were the difference between suicide and rehab. I wouldn’t be here without them. Again thank you all so much.

74807	0	a	Well two months ago I had all of my teeth pulled, and then waited until my mouth had healed enough for me to get dentures. 
74808	0	a	Okay so, Ive never touched hard drugs, but after years of severe depression, binge eating disorder, and abuse, i have really bad teeth  I had a tooth taken out a couple years ago because it hd rotted down to half a tooth. Now I have my two front teeth getting holes in the sides that are visible now, a half tooth from rotting again, this time on the other side and a giant cavity on the other side  I cant get that tooth removed withoit a replacement because otherwise I wont be able to chew on that side    My family is super poor (we can t rven afford my moms  diabetes and my schizophrenia amd depression meds)   My mom has several rotting teeth and one front bottom tooth has fallen out both me amd her are embaressed by our teeth  i dont speak much, i dont smile past a closed lip smile and I hate photos of myself  I cant close my boyfriend anymore because i dont want him to cut/feel  his lip or tounge on my broken/rotting teeth  Ive gone into deep depressions because of my teeth and habe considered suicide before at the thought of all my teeth falling out  i brush daily, sometimes multiple times a day now, but those nearly 17 years of undiagnosed depression and taking shitty care of myself has left its mark  Is there anywhere I can go for free or reduced dental care I just need to get this fixed and I dont know what to do    EDIT:  I cant thank you guys enough for your tips and stuff! ill be checking them out tonight and seeing what my area offers and what I can  get involved with that might help

74825	0	a	I struggled with severe post partum depression when my first was born. I wished every day that I could just be dead. But seeing my little guy smile at me and start giving me hugs and realizing that he loved me more than anyone else in the whole world is what kept me going and helped pull me out of it. Everytime I start getting down again, one of the things I remind myself over and over again is that I do not want him to have to live a life without his mom. Our kids are most precious. 
74826	0	a	He really is everything my wife and I ever wanted.  It’s incredible how life can turn around on you. You just always got stick to looking for the big picture. Life is a movie staring you.you just gotta see it through to the very end.  That’s what’s gotten me by.

74828	0	a	"Awesome outlook and congrats.  Something that I don't think guys talk about enough is the hard moments of parenting an infant can be.  I have two kids and, man, that first year with each of them was sometimes rough.  Not, oh we didn't sleep well last night rough.  Not, wow this baby needs a lot of attention, rough.  Poor us.  But I remember a couple instances where I didn't know why they were crying, trying everything, and having legit violent urges.  When I got really frustrated, it wasn't my son or daughter, it was this illogical thing that I didn't understand how to pacify.  In other circumstances I really think I have a ""normal"" temperament, but my kids at that age would that set me off in almost a primal way.  In our case, my wife was wired different.  Instant bond.  Instant patience.  Once they started smiling and babbling, it was different for me.  It's almost like I needed them to have a personality, and I realize that that sounds really selfish.  I don't think I'm saying this because you mentioned you were once suicidal, I tell all my friends that just had kids.  It's just something I wish someone told me.  There will be moments you need to put the kid in the crib and walk away until you get your shit together.  Then there will be moments like your picture, where you know why you're on this planet and recognize that they're the best thing that's ever happened to you.  Enjoy the ride!"

I am single, on unemployment insurance, my teeth are crooked and one of the front ones is broken in half, my parents are dead, I live in a dead end town, and I have been fairly depressed this year.   It's alright though, we all have our own paths with our own circumstances. I'm able to live my life pretty comfortably despite everything being wrong so I feel pretty good for now.

A few things I tell people after that job/rant:   Don’t lean your seat back when you’re the passenger. I know it’s tempting on those long road trips. I saw more than one partially decapitated person with their seat leaned back. Seat belt will slice through your neck. Your spine will (probably) stop it.   Wear your seatbelt and wear it *properly*! I saw so many people thrown hundreds of feet from their vehicle because they didn’t have a seatbelt on. You ain’t gonna look pretty after breaking the windshield with your face. I saw a case where a seatbelted sibling was killed when their unseatbelted sibling flew into them during a collision. Seatbelts are designed to work when used exactly as intended. So none of that half wearing it bullshit. You’re more likely to break bones and rupture your organs when you wear it incorrectly.   Get into a collision around 40 mph without a seatbelt on? Expect some very sore knees and some dents in your dash where your knees slammed into it.   Besides seatbelts, *use your blinkers people*. Saw too many cases where people died because they didn’t use blinkers! And yes, we most definitely can tell if you were using it or not!   And slow the fuck down y’all! Not too slow. But goddamn you don’t need to be doing 95 without a death wish. Do you know what a human pancake looks like, because I do and it’s not cute! Your car is not invincible, it will flatten. Saw a little Geo go head on into a big ol’ Suburban at 100 mph and everyone died. Little car and big car, no survivors. Just dead pancake people. I’ve seen bodies so burnt that a skeleton was left and we had to use dental records to ID the bodies. I’ve seen people cut in half, I’ve seen limbs in ditches, I’ve seen a decapitated head in the bed of a truck. Don’t get me started on all the babies and kids I’ve seen killed by drunk drivers.   People forget how dangerous driving can be and get too comfortable. 
74886	0	a	man im so happy i came to r/happy for these grotesque, detailed descriptions of car crashes.
74887	0	a	Yeah...sorry everyone. Didn’t realize the sub I was posting in. I saw a lot of bad stuff in my two years at that job and the thing that really got me is how much of it was so preventable. I try to tell people about it hoping someone might slow down a little, buckle up, check their blind spot, and just be a little more patient. 
74888	0	a	I think we all aspire for that text. Still waiting for mine. 
74889	0	a	I always wondered what it would be like to have an adult conversation with my Dad. My pops died when I was 12, so I really only knew him from the point of view of a kid.  I’m 25 now and still feel some jealousy and resentment when people talk about their relationship with their father.  EDIT: Wow, I leave a comment about my father, go to sleep, and wake up to find that Reddit is full of kind, supportive people, many of whom are in the same situation. Thank you everyone, it really means a lot to know that complete strangers could be so caring.  I know that a lot of people don’t have great relationships with their father, to say the least. I recognize that but feel I can’t really comment on it, it’s just something that’s so foreign to me.  What really gets to me is the thought of what my life could have been if something so tragic hadn’t happened at such a young age. My pops had a long, ugly battle with cancer, and most of the time it was filled with uncertainty. After he passed I took a complete 180 in my life, in terms of my interests and habits. As a child I always wanted to be a scientist and find a cure for AIDS. After my Dad died I dropped this. I think I was trying to distance myself from anything that reminded me of him, he was always supportive of my dreams.  At 12 I started smoking pot regularly and got into theatre. Being in my hometown was too painful. As a family, we’d been living overseas since I was 6 but came back when he was sick. So my Mum and I moved.  Throughout my teenage years I was plagued with indecision and zero ability to commit to anything. I fell into a pattern of underachievement and disappointment with myself.  Now I’m going to teacher’s college for elementary grades. I’ve discovered I like working with children and I want to help them achieve their full potential, something I feel that I could never do. I’m really enjoying it and I know that I’ll be an excellent, dedicated educator. But still, I’m constantly wondering what could’ve been.
74890	0	a	Me too OP!  https://imgur.com/TiaS0dl  Congrats on making your dad proud 😁
74891	0	a	It really strikes me how much better my life would feel to just hear this kind of encouragement from my own father. Bet a lot of kids out there wait their whole lives for words like this

74920	0	a	Wow! I can’t even imagine the work you put in to get to this point! I suffer from depression as well and the idea of trying to organize that first space gives me a lot of anxiety. The work you clearly put in is immense, overcoming your depression and tackling it is nothing short of awe inspiring. I hope you appreciate and celebrate you for the awesomeness you are. I’m inspired by you. Honestly. My place is a touch less messy than your first pic due to my own depression and cleaning it seems insurmountable to me. I can’t quite put into words how impressed I am that you’ve overcome that obstacle and achieved what you have. So I’ll merely say, congrats and I’m so happy for you!

74966	0	a	At least 7 days. 
74967	0	a	OP - if you don't mind sharing, what are some of the challenges you mentioned above?
74968	0	a	Careful with those starfishes though. Those can be super addicting. Had a friend who did them. Once they got a hold of him, they never let go. 
74969	0	a	As far as their limbs go they are pretty sturdy. Not sure if they're called limbs but..
74970	0	a	Sure thing! I had to learn that using drugs wasn't my actual problem. Using drugs is just a symptom of my disease. So when you take a way the drugs, I was still that little irresponsible, insecure, damaged boy I had been all my life. Navigating through relationships was extremely challenging. Getting to work on time, paying bills, showing up for my family etc was challenging. Losing people to the disease has been challenging. Big changes in the support group. Dealing with my untreated PTSD and severe anxiety. And one of the biggest ones was recently when my best friend relapsed on heroin. The thought of losing him was hard. Sorry, I feel like I'm rambling. Overall.. when you've gone your whole life being incapable or unwilling to function, living clean is difficult. By the grace of a power greater than myself, I haven't had the desire to use since I got clean, which is a miracle!
74971	0	a	> Not sure if they're called limbs but..  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say they are.
74972	0	a	Same boat here. Husband and I have been sober two years now. Getting sober, looking back, was the easy part. Dealing with the emotions and putting in the work to identify and overcome is much more complex.   Congratulations to you & your bride. You both look so alive and happy! Keep up the great work! 
74973	0	a	Oh, I really like this one. I feel like it is so applicable to modern society. So many people look at others who are happy and wonder what they are missing in comparison. And they wish for money, fame, good looks, etc., without looking much further.  Some achieve it but still aren't happy.    Here, the kiwi compared his wings but doesn't wish for flight. If he had what they had - the ability to fly - he wouldn't necessarily get what he really wanted. So he accepted himself as he is and asked for companionship. Even with his stubby wings. It's beautiful. 
74974	0	a	K I W I B O Y E does a friendly 
74975	0	a	I had just sent a text to my ex whom I'm still close with even if we're not romantic with each other. I was complaining how being a single adult who's friends have mostly moved away, with a job that I never see co-workers, I feel trapped in a 24/7 prison of emotional solitude. Right after I hit send I opened my browser and this comic was there hitting me right in the feels
74976	0	a	I interpreted this differently.   In the top right panel he's flapping, wishing he could fly so he could join the others.   I feel like that's what his wish was.   And then when he was given companionship, he realized he didn't need to fly.

74980	0	a	I’ll be 40 this year and have wrestled with it my whole life although it’s confined to one spot. I’m a guy but like my hair long and that’s when it’s the hardest. Most people prob won’t see the bald spot, or maybe they do. But it’s such a weird compulsion. GOOD FOR YOU!!!!
74981	0	a	Wow, congratulations! I had to look up trichotillomania, and now I understand why your beautiful hair is so short! :)  Very good work! You are an inspiration! :)
74982	0	a	You look amazing! We’re all so proud of you!
74983	0	a	Thank you so much! I quit smoking 3 months after I shaved it, and I still didn't pull. Let it grow starting new years day. I am so proud of myself. I never thought I'd ever quit pulling. 
74984	0	a	Yeah, I get the strangest looks trying to explain that I don't have cancer (I work at a retirement community). It is by far the strangest compulsion. It started with getting glue in my hair, of all things. 
74985	0	a	Yes! I pulled for since 3rd grade, and shaved it last July in the effort to break the habit. New years I started growing it out and have been pull free!  *Dances* thank you so much! 
74986	0	a	Holy shit, that's even more impressive!!! Good for you, that must've been really difficult. Perhaps you could mentor other people with trich someday, and instill hope that it can be conquered :)
74987	0	a	I pulled my hair out when I was anxious or tired. It's an obsessive compulsive disorder. 
74988	0	a	That is the sweetest thing I think any person has ever said. I am a mess of a human being though. Next step is loosing weight
74989	0	a	You're a work in progress darlin, and you overcame two HUGE feats. You can't do that unless you have strength and resilience. So be kind to yourself and your messiness. ;)

74991	0	a	Wtf, my paint class we did a stupid daisy. Both of your paintings are beautiful. Those are interestingly different from each other, I like that. Are you keeping your own or giving each other your paintings? When I paint with my daughter we trade after, but they aren't nearly as gorgeous.

74993	0	a	The painting on the left has a very nuanced and specked tree trunk, complete with detailed mountains and even birds flying in the distance.  The painting on the right has a tree trunk that is dark and abnormally deformed, the mountains are mal-formed, there are no natural flying birds but instead a lurking monster.  This is clearly a cry for help.
74994	0	a	It can be pretty confusing, but dude, is actually on the left.   edit: woah, it's my cakeday!   Dear Diary,        Today my only comment on reddit was a very lighthearted fairly cheesy joke made on /r/happy.

Imagine it vs a 95 suburban for example.  You have to have a motorcycle mentality in this thing.  Please hit me up with any questions you have about the car. I know the things inside and out and id be more than happy to guide you through any repairs.  Also don't listen to that mechanic punk below me, it all comes with time, you got this. It's as easy as they come, it's going to take some long nights and busted knuckles, but you got this.
75037	0	a	Curious you got over your extreme fear of driving to step into a car that has trouble getting on the highway...  Serious question: What have you done to the VW? Did you buy it restored or work it up?  Looks really good. No rust, good chrome

75043	0	a	Baby steps and working harder than anything I’ve ever worked on. I started with short drives on the country side with my mom and then short drives to and from businesses in my small town. I’d stay in one corner of town until I felt comfortable with the roads and then move a little further each day until I felt like I could drive the whole area safely. Once I had that down I worked on parking because that was another big chunk that freaked me out. After parking probably 500 times I forced myself to just call and schedule my road test because that was the hardest part. Next step is getting comfortable in my new car. I’ve not taken her off country roads yet. I’m not very good with manuals yet. It’s just another road bump to get over though. It will be a long while before she’s on a highway but I’ll get there :)   As far as the car goes I’ve not put any work into her. Just a super lucky find on my end :)

75045	0	a	This car has pretty much no safety features. At least a motorcycle accident throws you away. In these things you can really only hope to get thrown through the windshield, or die. Otherwise your trapped inside the severely crushed body.  Most of the older models, iirc pre 67 have lap belts only, and those just fuck up your insides or snap you in half.   I could punch a hole in the side with a screw driver. You cant even sit on thay hood without it collapsing. only saving grace to the design is the German steel, but it usualy gets replaced with shitty BrazilIan or Mexican stuff as fenders get dented ect   These are bare-bones cars. That was the point. The people's car. You used to get them for free if you spent enough on groceries.  Also the engines in the back, so the only thing between you and what your hitting is a tank of gasoline and a spare tire, if you didn't take it out to actually be able to use the trunk. And you did.  The model pictured is a super, you can tell by the curved windshield and vents behind the back windows. So it's post 1970 (my guess is about a 71-72) and had real belts, still though, not much had changed besides that and better cvs. Oh, and a shitty foam dash to smash your face into that everyone just rips out.

75085	0	a	It honestly seems more like cats just don’t have the conception of boundaries that dogs do. Try to train a dog to stay off the couch and you might get somewhere. Try to train a cat to stay off the table and they’ll just wait until you’re out of arm’s reach. “I shouldn’t be on here” vs. “The human will bug me on here.”
75086	0	a	I trained my cat to not go on top of my fish tank by removing her from my room and closing the door and saying NO.  Took about 3 months but now she won’t even go near the fish tank and if I see her looking at it and say NO she’ll  meow and walk away.  And if she jumps on the table next to the fish tank if I say NO and walk over to her she’ll meow and run off.  Been using the word NO since she was 3 weeks old so she knows that the word NO means she’s doing something she’s not supposed to be doing   Kinda awesome lol

75096	0	a	This is really beautiful. It’s great to see custodians being acknowledged and celebrated. In my experience custodians at schools get treated so much better than in other place but I’m sure that’s not true everywhere. My dad worked as a custodian when I was growing up for a subsidized elderly apartment building. Despite him being incredibly nice to the residents (all residents had his personal phone number and could call him at any time day or night for their clogged toilet or leaky pipe, hell he went out there are 2am because a resident said their door closed “too loudly”.) yet they treated him like garbage.  One summer I worked as a custodian for a large manufacturing plant. Everyone I saw would tell me I needed to do a better job cleaning their cubicle, or I missed a spot over in x, even though it was just two of us cleaning a gigantic building and had cycles of what we cleaned on what days based on what the person in charge at the company wanted. Despite explaining this to them, they would continue to point out “mistakes” everyday.  Please appreciate what custodians do and give them respect. The jobs has its moments, but is never a great time. Feeling respected and appreciated goes a long way.

75115	0	a	I will never forget an incident in the 80’s when I was in fourth grade. Our janitor’s name was Fred Mackenzie (not his real name). All the students loved him. He was a pretty old guy, but he always had a kid-joke and candy. He came into our room one time and the kids all erupted with, “Hi, Mr. Mackenzie!!”  He told us his daily joke, fixed something on the tv, and went on his merry way.   After he left, my teacher gave us a speech about how “Fred” was a janitor. He didn’t go to school like teachers did. So teachers are Misters and Misses, but janitors can be called by their first names.  Someone asked about the principal’s secretary and lunch ladies. She said they’re “polite first namers.”  I’ll never forget that phrase. She explained that they also didn’t go to college, but they deserve “a little more respect,” so you call them “Miss First Name.”  Therefore, Mrs. Georgina Fartenbottom was no longer “Mrs. Fartenbottom,” she was “Miss George.”  Through grammar school, middle school, high school, college, and grad school, my fourth grade teacher ranks in the top 3 worst teachers I’ve ever had (and it’s a tie between those 3).  She was such a piece of garbage on so many levels. For god’s sake, she was a 300 pound moose and she decided to go around the room telling students if they were, “fat, chunky, or skinny.”  She then proceeded to tell those fourth graders if they’d be fat for life based on “are either of your parents fat?”  One skinny girl was told she’s skinny now, but she’ll probably turn out to be “as big as a house.”  Not sure if it’s related or not, but she got chunky in 8th grade and committed suicide when she was a sophomore in high school. I went to a different high school than all my 8th grade friends, so I didn’t hear any details beyond what was in the newspaper.

Make small talk with them. Do small tokens for Xmas/holidays. It’s amazing how far those little count for a lot.

When I asked about fundal height, he told me, ""I'll put it to you this way: if that were twins, they'd be big."" I went to the hospital today to have my pre-op bloodwork done and every single one of the phlebotomists and nurses said, ""are you having twins?"" I'm 38+6 and completely miserable, but also very relieved about the end being very much in sight.

75181	0	a	I’ve (32/m) dreamed since high school of having kids (especially twins or a daughter) and it’s so incredible to me to think that “loving fathers” are some sort rare breed that we need more of. My father -like everyone else’s- wasn’t perfect, but his love for me and my siblings was without question. I don’t think being a loving father has any prerequisite of being raised by a loving father, but I don’t doubt it helps.   My wife and I are “trying” (haphazardly, to be sure - we’ve just removed all contraception from the equation) so hopefully soon there will be at least one more source of “these examples.” :)  (Edit: a word)

75188	0	a	This might have been a joke, but I tend to talk normally to my animals instead of barking commands at them, and I genuinely think we have better communication for it.

To me, it's fascinating trying to communicate across species.

I never treated her differently (mostly because I'm awkward af and don't know how) but she always grew up respecting me and thinking of me as a friend rather than someone 15 years her senior."

75206	0	a	Can't stress the reading part enough.  My mom read books to me from the time I was old enough to hold my head up.  I could read on my own by age three, by the time I was in 2nd grade I was in my own solo reading group in school because I was reading at a high school level.  I read To Be A Slave when I was in 3rd grade for an in-class book report assignment, and the teacher didnt believe me until I sat down in front of her and wrote the damn report on the spot.   Whats cute is I dont know exactly when I started reading on my own, only that it was discovered at age 3.  I hid it from my parents.  My mom suspected it and tricked me into handing her a book id never seen before, asking for it by its title.  The reason I hid it?  I was afraid if they knew I could do it on my own, that they'd stop reading to me at night. Its not just about language, its about bonding.  Read to your kids every chance you get.

75216	0	a	Thank you. Loving fathers were never a rarity. We’ve culturally normalized abusive, emotionally distant, withholding relationships. We’ve also devastated the adult male populations of black communities in the United States.  It’s rich to low key call out black men for not being good fathers when they’re often missing because they’ve been targeted for incarceration.  Edit: Either we all agree that systemic racism results in disproportionate numbers of people of color being put behind bars, or y'all own up to the inherent racism in arguing that people of color are just predisposed to commit crime because they're people of color.

75227	0	a	I've seen this way too much in my line of work. Do the parents spend all their time on their phones and not looking at or talking to the child? Do they have any books in their house and is the kid ever read to?  Just physically looking at your kids when you are talking with them goes a HUGE way towards speech development, as well as social interactions and emotional development and regulation.  And I can't even describe the difference in quality of life and abilities just being read to makes.  Some kids go into kindergarten recognizing speech patterns, rhymes, letters, - some can even read already.  Then they are in the same class as kids who don't know how to hold the book the right way up or which way to turn the pages   Who is going to be more successful in school? And whose responsibility is it to prepare the child for their life? Teachers and other support people can only do so much.

75313	0	a	My border collie always looks super sad (except when he’s just around me) because he knows he can con people into petting him   Someone walks by? He stops wagging his tail, puts his tongue away, and gives them a sad side eye. He also does it when he wants some of my food or wants permission to come up onto the couch or bed.   Works every time.  Edit: since some people like this...   A few months after I got him, he injured his paw and for a couple days after had a slight limp. During that time I had to lift him onto the bed and in and out of the car.   Now, occasionally when he’s feeling lazy, he’ll lift his paw up and limp and pretend he’s hurt so I’ll carry him when I’m putting him in the car or when he’s had enough of a walk.   The vet has confirmed he’s completely fine. He’s just a liar.
75314	0	a	It looks like the cabin could be connected to the house itself (you can see a larger structure behind the cabin, very near by), maybe built over a dog door. And the fence is surrounding the entire yard, the cabin is probably facing an alley that people use between streets when walking.

75395	0	a	I so badly want one of these for my zippity kitty. I just keep waffling because I'm not fully convinced she'll use it, and if she does do I really want to listen to her using it at 4am when she gets her morning zoomies?  Edit - aaaaaaaand order placed. Between Amazon completely losing their birthday presents, and my zippity kitty losing her mind while her sister was gone to the vet for an hour, it's worth a try. I think once I get zippity past her standard initial anxiety reaction it should work out for her, and if her sister likes it that will be some extra motivation. 
75396	0	a	Thank you all so much, for the lovely comments and gold and whatnot!  I’m glad so many other people love my sweet Pippa!  There are a lot of questions I thought I’d try to answer in one go:  1. I bought the wheel from [One Fast Cat](https://onefastcat.com/cat-wheel?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtvPjBRDPARIsAJfZz0onGFQeEG6vz7zgldjfrMAo4HiZSDjntat3-Z8jng9WSU2vyKV1cbIaAu8lEALw_wcB).  They’re typically $199, but it went on sale on Black Friday for $150.  2. Pippa was 6 months old when I bought the wheel.  She is very active and toy-motivated.  Running a feather toy or laser light over it got her accustomed to the movement when she ran over it, and within a week, she started running on it of her own free will (though she goes much faster when a laser light is on it!).  My 5-year-old food-motivated cat refuses to have anything to do with it to this day.  I’ve had it for about a year-and-a-half and it’s holding up well.  3. Pippa was a stray, so I have no clue as to her lineage, but my vet says she’s a lynxpoint Siamese (which is like a Siamese/tabby mix).    4. I mentioned in the comments that I have a video where Pippa over-exerted herself after eating and threw up on the wheel.  I’ll upload that shortly and link it here for those who don’t get grossed out too easily :) [here ya go, ya sickos](https://www.reddit.com/r/awwwtf/comments/axeie7/pippa_is_the_best_workout_buddy_until_she_loses/)

75399	0	a	They are pretty good to get some energy out, but theyre kinda loud and they love to use them at 3 am
75400	0	a	My cat might play with the box that comes with the wheel, but no promises after that.
75401	0	a	Lol wow!  I guess I’m lucky my other cat doesn’t like it!  Sometimes Pippa gets going so fast I’m worried she’ll fly out or do a 360, but so far she’s stayed on the track.
75402	0	a	lol love how the cats just fly out. 
75403	0	a	Last week, my other cat woke me up, letting me know it was time for breakfast.  She doesn’t usually do that, but I went ahead and served them their canned food early.  I then went and hopped on the bike.  Pippa joined me after a few minutes, licking her chops as she jogged.  I started thinking about how I can’t work out after I’ve eaten because I’ll throw up, and just then, Pippa came to a stop and projectile vomited her chicken-herring paté all over the wheel and surrounding carpet.  It was pretty gross, but I did catch it on camera because my mom had wanted to see Pippa in action.  I’ll have to post that video another time (and maybe not in r/awww).

75405	0	a	Oh yeah, Pippa is no help with floor work!  As soon as I’m off the bike, she wants to be picked up, no matter how sweaty I am.  So much fur 😩
75406	0	a	Yeah, I was really on the fence about it, too.  I finally gave in when it went on sale for Black Friday, and I swear they had a 30-day return policy that helped me feel better about buying it (now the website says they’ll only take it back if it’s unopened and charge you a restocking fee, which doesn’t help).  My older cat has never really taken to it, but I got it when Pippa was about 6 months old and she started using it by herself within a week.  Not sure how much it has to do with age or breed or temperament, but I think starting younger helps.

75441	0	a	I realize this is all about khajit though I do want to share a cat sitting trick. If you are going away and have a cat(s) that are not social or skittish, chances are they will hide from whomever comes to feed them.   This is not fun as a sitter if they (cats) need medication or I need to know if they are actually eating.   Make simple cat tents with sheets and chairs, drape a sheet off a desk, a bed etc. They will hide in a tent and your pet sitter can find them and report on their health with so much more ease and accuracy.   I once spent 45 minutes looking for a cat that needed a small dose of a tuna flavored medication, owner put a tent in each room and ever since not only does it make my life easier but the cats are more likely to eat when they feel hidden so they get (tent) room service

75480	0	a	When I was a butcher/store manager in a fancy grocery store in NYC back in the late 2000s, Hugh Jackman came in one morning with one of his kids. He was by far the nicest person, not just celebrity, who’d every shopped in our store. Gracious and kind to everyone. His kid was super nice and well behaved too, which to me says a lot.   Might sound like a creeper, but he also had the most muscular butt I’ve seen on a human. He looks like a super hero
75481	0	a	The thing i like about this is that the feeling you get is very personal and even trying to explain it and even if someone says they understand, they really don't. The won't know the magic because of how much more of a fan perhaps you were and how you were the only one in the world to experience such a moment. It's a strong moment for sure !

75524	0	a	No, it’s from his tour Hugh Jackman The Tour. I went and saw this in DC earlier this year with my wife (her desire, not mine) and he does a lot of his songs from musicals he’s been in. It’s a bit of storytelling, music, personal experiences, etc. It was better than I expected. He did something similar at the event I went to but it was over a guy and his socks (different people for sure), brought him up on stage, they did a bit together, it was really great.   If you like High Jackman and want to see him perform live, it’s a good show.

75527	0	a	Hey no you don't. I have massive self worth issues but I've been doing CBT, and here's what I've learned: You only feel like you suck - you are a splendid being who is capable of amazing things, as is everyone else out there. Try and take a stock of all the times you get down on yourself in a day, and think about why that may be. If it's a thing you can control, then don't judge yourself, just write a little plan with lots of baby steps of how to take control of it. If you make even one tiny victory of this list, then pat the fuck out of your own back, even if you have to feel like you're faking it. Soon you'll start to feel genuine pride in yourself, and fuck it's the most amazing feeling ever. And when you can love yourself even a little bit the relationships you have with people will change so much and people will feel all your love too. Love you dude, have a good day!  Also if you're just a r/meirl type making self effacong joke comments, have a lovely day anyway, and disregard the above.

75571	0	a	I have an English Shepherd and I would say you do too. Mine is almost identical to yours. Best dog in the world. (https://i.imgur.com/MICC81L.jpg)
75572	0	a	> She follows me everywhere from room to room which I don't think can be that healthy but she seems like a happy dog.  Some dogs are naturally like that. My dog was a black lab and Chinese shar pei mix, and the CSP is a shepherding dog. We lived in a studio apartment, and he still followed me around in our tiny space. If I was on the couch, he’d move near or next to me. Get up and start cooking? Laying outside his line of the kitchen. Go back to the couch? So will he.   He didn’t retrieve anything, but he definitely was a shepherd. 
75573	0	a	As long as it works for you and for her that’s all that matters.

Mission barking accomplished.     She was just doing her job to keep us both 100% safe and together.   Nearly saved that marriage, TBH.

I was ""out"" of weed but can almost always find some stashed around my cabin - a bud on the desk, a roach on the counter, something somewhere. So I started to poke around......  I was squatting down looking in my nightstand drawer when my [dog](https://i.imgur.com/aKqtaRL.jpg) came up and stuck his nose in. A curious german shepherd, he obviously wanted to know what I was looking for. So I told him: ""Ganja ganja. Good dog, where's the ganja?""  My dog trotted off and I went back to the nightstand. A moment later I look over to see my dog sniffing purposefully, looking up at my shirts in the closet. Sure enough, an entire rolled joint in the shirt pocket - I never would have found it.  He is a good dog and ""ganja"" is a good word to know."

75794	0	a	I had a roommate in college who did this EXACT same thing! She drew baby versions of her favorite hockey players — like naked baby versions next to the team logos and jersey numbers. She then continued to sketch vignettes of them in biologically compromising situations, like puking over someone’s shoulder or little vignettes of tinkle coming out into the training potty.... I’m not gonna lie, she was an amazing artist. But holy hamshack was her antenna installed wrong. her mom made homemade cabbage patch dolls and the home she grew up in was basically a Victorian dollhouse diorama come-to-life. She used to keep a tiny glass vile with her toenail pieces that she would peel off with her mouth like a yoga instructor and she kept them nicely arranged under the head of her bed. She also ate thread as a habit. Like right off the spool.  I’m not kidding this isn’t copypasta. AMA

75832	0	a	The first time we realized she was eating thread off of the spool, that was pretty memorable.. I’m older and was in college when the tv series friends started. We were also a couple years in so we had our own house off campus. We were sitting around with our housemates and friends from the house across the street (this will be important in a moment) watching a new episode - we all heard little saliva noises and the whole room slowly turned to look at her (people were on couches, on the floor, but she was in the lounger at the back corner of the room) and she has this piece of black thread coming out of her mouth down to her lap, to the spool!? and she very nonchalantly reached down and broke the thread with her fingers while everyone was silently glaring at her, and then proceeded to shove the rest of the thread into her mouth! We were all drinking and stoned so it was hilarious and the room broke out with laughter and confusion and questions, she responded with a funny “get off my back” kinda way. we didn’t think anything of it, we all knew her for two year and knew she was ... “creative.” But unanimously our favorite act of bonkers was when we were doing a coat drive for the middle school near where we lived off campus. Our housemates and neighbor friends got old coats from home over break and we had them all in boxes in our living room. Another housemate and I took the boxes to donate that weekend and when dropping them off the woman there asked us if our kids had grown out of them, we were like “no, these were our when we were kids, just donating...” then she asked something that didn’t relate to her fist question but also didn’t make any sense as a .... she asked “why did you cut the elastic cuffs off all these jackets?”. (It’s important to mention that in the early 90s elastic cuffs on jackets were a thing.) she took the donation,but, It was immediate. I knew, my neighbor I think knew right away. We went back and asked.. she said that the thread that makes the cuffs on old jackets is salty. If she wasn’t so damn wacky fun other than her.. being a weirdo... I would have thought she was a serial killer.  Edit: I’d like to add the one of the more memorable parts of that was all the weeks after this being all, “I cannot believe she ate 16 jacket cuffs.” amongst our friends... something you never expect to say.

75854	0	a	Wow thank you Reddit! I'm legitimately choked up at all the kind things you internet strangers said. I wish I could communicate all of it to him. I'm really touched and can't wait to show my parents all the uplifting comments. 100% chance my mom will start sobbing in a good way (there is more rejection for him as an adult because maybe he is fidgety in public or does a number on someone's toilet 😂 etc. So with all the encouragement I bet she is going to be so torn up). I think you just gave her the best Christmas present ever. Thank you all a million times! Really, I had no idea so many people would be so goddamn nice.  Note: I never actually heard the term downsie in a derogatory way but I can see how that might be a thing. I thought it was an affectionate reference. I hope it's obvious from the context it is meant to be loving. 
75855	0	a	I have a sister with downs and her mental capacity has declined so much of as late. This brings tears to my eyes because I know the beautiful heart she has and how she used to express it. I miss the love she used to show so much. Lately she barely acknowledges me. Thank you for making that loving gesture to your brother. His reaction is priceless. 
75856	0	a	Thank you for this. My cousin’s son has Downs. From birth, he hated strangers. When I first met him, he was almost a year old. My family said “don’t be discouraged if he doesn’t want to be around you.”   The whole family surprised me at the airport and brought him. He surprised everyone by reaching for me immediately... and every moment after, he stuck to me like glue. He had this thing that he’d do with me and no one else (then or ever since) where he’d yell “ahhhhhhh” and lick my face. I’d tilt him over where his head was almost on the ground and he’d giggle like crazy and I’d lift him up straight and he’d yell again and lick my face and giggle until I’d lean him over again. It was Christmas week and I ended up being the person he chose to sit on my lap and open his presents.   When he was 3 or so, I moved down there. I rented a room from family and he’d yell “KNO KNO” Like “knock knock” without the “k” and then stick his toes and fingers under my bedroom door. When he was convinced I had seen them, he’d bust open my door and climb in my bed and point to the tv. I could just continue doing my computer work while he watched cartoons in my bed as long as I let him wear my pajama pants as a scarf. Every time I looked over, he’d give me a huge grin.   I haven’t been down there in 5 years or so. But I miss that kid so much.

I've had a pretty brutal month in a lot of ways and I didn't realize how much I needed this.  Thank you for reminding me that love is something we all share and that we all need; that it's not complication and suffering and labor and hardship and duty; that it's simple and pure and joyful and fragile and the most important thing in life.  I need to love more like your brother does.  I think we all do.
75861	0	a	So sweet! :) I have older sister with Downs. She's 37 now and I could not be more proud of her. She is so independent, she know how to read, write, sing, playing zither and much more. She can even prepare food on her own.   &nbsp;  It is important how much time do you spend teaching Downs people  in early life. My mother did a fantastic job; she pretty much dedicated her life for my sister. When she was born, doctors said that she won't be able to do any of those thing she can do it now. But my mother prove them wrong big time ! :)

People with disabilities, let alone downs, are some of the sweetest people on Earth.   My brother has downs too and no matter what I’ll always believe he has to be the most down to earth person I know; he’s very kind to anyone he meets and happy to help in anyway. Shame on anyone who discriminated against people with mental disabilities.

75872	0	a	They’re basically jello people when they’re that small. Have someone hand them to you when you are sitting in a chair. You have no chance of dropping the baby then. And you can’t hurt it unless you shake it like a snowglobe. Just hold it and rock back and forth. Baby will either sleep or smile and coo. You will be smitten. If it cries, you will want to fix all the world’s problems. Which can be done for the baby with a bottle, diaper change, or a song. Even if you are the shittiest singer ever, the baby will love if you hum or sing.   Source: I am r/childfree all the way but was a nanny for a long time. Infants are the easiest to handle. As a parent, they’re the worst. But as a friend? Just hold it. It’s the easiest interaction you’ll ever have with a kid. 
75873	0	a	I'm pretty sure my husband almost cried when he was first told to hold our daughter.  Not because she was his first born, gorgeous baby, but because she was tiny and fragile and all he could think about was dropping her.

75880	0	a	Fidgety in public makes me laugh because my cousin’s son with Downs LOVES eating in restaurants but he HAS TO HAVE a fist bump from the waiter before ordering. Most are super cool with it thankfully but occasionally they are confused. He just needs it before ordering. He loves restaurants like Denny’s with picture menus cause he can order for himself. After he gets knucks, he points at what he wants and smiles at the waiter. Family always reiterates what he wants but he’s so fucking proud of himself for ordering on his own it makes me want to cry. And the last time I saw him do it, he was like 4 and now he is probably 7 or 8.

He loves everyone and everything. As an infant, he was very particular and hated strangers. Family warned me the first time I met him that he wouldn’t warm up to me for a while. They surprised me at the airport and brought him. He cried and screamed... to come to me! And once he did, he never let me put him down. Surprised them all. He and I ended up developing our own inside jokes (he was less than a year old) that consisted of me holding him and tickling his neck then he’d lick my check so I’d lean him over all the way until his head almost hit the ground then bring him up giggling. He ended up being super attached to me for years. I miss that kid.

75895	0	a	I have a sister with down syndrome and the title made me flinch a little, but more because of the expected onslaught from the politically correct police, who would never commit any of their time to supporting people living with a disability, but will get on their high horse about terminology and pat themselves on the back for their perceived moral superiority. It's quite clear that there was no malice behind the term.

I was a mom and grandmother , have 3 younger sibs , helped my mom in her in home daycare starting at age 12 on through my late teens ( which included infants , one of which started there at 3 days old ) so I was a old hand at babies . But this one was so very small that he felt like he would slip through my arms and he was so tiny I was scared to hold him to tight . I finally understood why some people felt terrified when they held a infant .

75910	0	a	When we did our genetic testing and decided to add in trisomy 21 to the screen, I learned a fair bit about it so I could be sure I wanted to know if my son was at risk for it.

It is very important to infants and I would say people in general to just be held and be close to other people. His innocent desire to just cradle a baby for the sake of wanting to cradle a baby makes him good.

75928	0	a	The ones who die young due to heart defect is because there is a significant change of someone with Downs having said defect. They're associated conditions, so it's not a *total* misconception.
75929	0	a	This comment won’t be popular, but  Never let a low functioning individual hold an infant with its face against the shoulder like that. suffocation. you took a big risk.  my daughter is low functioning down syndrome,  she is beautiful inside and out,  so my words are not intended toward the condition. 
75930	0	a	Also 60 years ago medicine was pretty shit.   Today my grandmother is as old as her mother when she died; she just had major surgery to remove about 12ft of shitter pipe and is diabetic on top of that.  She’s in a bad way, but is easily going to beat her mothers record by about 10 years.   60 years ago, it would have just been “shit, your pooper shooters expired. Which plot would you like?”  
75931	0	a	It’s not really a misconception, and the notion that those with Down syndrome typically have shorter life spans isn’t exactly unsupported. Of course have Down syndrome doesn’t mean that you *will* die young but it’s usually associated with other health conditions. The rate of congenital heart disease in newborns with Down syndrome is up to 40% and this absolutely impacts life expectancy, unfortunately. Even more unfortunate is that heart disease is only one of the many conditions associated with Down syndrome. 
75932	0	a	60 is still a shorter life expectancy than people born without DS, and to many people dying in your 50s or 60s is dying young.   > Individuals with Down syndrome have a higher risk of early death than the general population.[19] This is most often from heart problems or infections.[1][7] Following improved medical care, particularly for heart and gastrointestinal problems, the life expectancy has increased.[1] This increase has been from 12 years in 1912,[104] to 25 years in the 1980s,[1] to 50 to 60 years in the developed world in the 2000s.[7][8] Currently between 4 and 12% die in the first year of life.[46] The probability of long-term survival is partly determined by the presence of heart problems. In those with congenital heart problems 60% survive to 10 years and 50% survive to 30 years of age.[11] In those without heart problems 85% survive to 10 years and 80% survive to 30 years of age.[11] About 10% live to 70 years of age.[56] The National Down Syndrome Society have developed information regarding the positive aspects of life with Down syndrome.[105]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome#Prognosis

75953	0	a	I just love watching older dogs with puppies.   When we got a puppy our senior dog was beside himself. He followed the puppy everywhere. He was half blind and he could barely keep track of the puppy but I'd never seen him so happy. He had always been a friendly, enthusiastic dog but the puppy gave him a second wind and maybe added a year or so to his life.   That was nearly 12 years ago and now our puppy is an old dog. Their lives are just too fast. 
75954	0	a	This reminds me of my neighbors dog, he was on his death bed, the vet said he'd live another two weeks at the most. I brought my puppy over to meet him, and he instantly got up and ran toward her. He start to play with her like this. He lived another six months, he came to our back door daily to see my dog and i'd let her out to play with him all the time. It was almost like he was asking if my pup could come out to play... how could you say no to that?   Edit: [I felt obligated here's them playing](https://imgur.com/a/Bc9N3)

75959	0	a	This video makes me SO happy. I brought my 9 month old Bernese home to my senior, family lab. Prior to him meeting my puppy, he was super depressed after my other family dog passed last year due to old age. He was constantly needing snuggles and attention, very little play drive (which also, admittedly, comes with age), and refusing to walk in the grass or stay outside. He was super lonely due to living alone with my mom after years of canine companionship. Now he’s rough housing, chewing on bones, and playing all day with my pupper. (:

The once puppy who met the old dog, then became the old dog and met the new young pup. I've always wondered if the old pup takes on the ""parental"" role and an instinct kicks in. Or if there's any science or study behind it. I've always observed them taking care of and following the pup"
75964	0	a	I wonder if older dogs realize they were once puppies. Probably not, but a man can dream. 
75965	0	a	This is what my dogs experienced only in reverse in terms of size.

She was the boss and kept those two in line and they kept her younger. It was hilarious.

75970	0	a	Yeah it's sucks we only get such a short time with them, relatively speaking.  We tend to prefer large breeds in my family and they're lucky to even make it a decade usually. :(  Our only way to deal has been to have multiple dogs that were staggered in ages. It really helps with coping when you still have a furbaby to tend to. Nothing is worse than coming home to an empty house after having to make that final decision.  Just their smell being everywhere...I bawled my eyes out on her bed that first night all alone.  Imagined her out the corner of my eye for *weeks* after, forgetting for a brief instant that she was gone.  Man that shit sucks.  I don't understand people that don't get emotionally attached to dogs. How could you not?
75971	0	a	I suggested to my 83yo father who lives alone that he should get another dog. No, no he said, I've outlived too many dogs. He only partly saw the humour when I brightly suggested that 'The next dog might be the one!'

She licks his face when she sees him and whines a lot etc, and his owner sometimes comes over and asks if our dog wants to have a play date with her dog. It is super cute. 
75978	0	a	My neighbors cat did that too. he would sit at our door, bumping into it until our cat noticed. They would play all day. It was adorable
75979	0	a	Two years ago I brought a Bernese Mountain Dog puppy home to my 8 year old Chow. It took her about a week to come around to the idea of not being an only dog any longer, but she's absolutely loved him ever since. They're thick as thieves now and having him around has given her her youth back. She used to just lay around the house but now she runs around, initiates play with him, and they chase squirrels together in the backyard.  Edit: [Puppy](https://imgur.com/a/CWvY9) Tax! The Berner is named Ser Jorah (yes, after the Game of Thrones character) and the Chow is named Naya. He's 2 years old now, and she's 10.

The day after I had to put him down (cancer), I woke up; groggily went to the front door and opened it.  Stood there for a full minute, realizing that he was never coming down the stairs again after me. My mom looked at me and asked me what I was doing. I kind of zoned out, stared right back, and fell to the floor and sobbed and sobbed.  It's been three years, it still hurts; but it gets better with every month.

76033	0	a	That is a defensive instinct of baby deer that kicked in at the wrong time and place.   Baby deer often drop down and remain still when they see a predator. They are not fast enough to out run a predator when they are that young. So trying to hide is a better option than running and exposing yourself to a predator that can easily catch up.   Actually, when mother deer are foraging, babies often hide in tall grass or bushes like this, until the mother returns. If you take a walk in the woods during calfing season, you can sometimes come across such babies. They won’t move a muscle until you get really really close. I got scared few times by a fawns dashing out of bushes that I was just walking past. As most predators avoid tracks used by humans (or any place that has human scent), mother deer often hide their babies close to such location. Unfortunately this also include roadways.

76061	0	a	That's actually fairly common behavior for deer. They've adapted to the roads, and use them as a place to leave their young while foraging for food since predators don't usually stalk roads. So in the deer handbook, this is some pretty A+ parenting.

But I've had a couple of really bad bites, went to the doctor, and once it was late at night, and I absolutely went to the ER, and they told me I was 100% right to do that.    I also want to correct that it's not just that the bacteria can get into the blood, but more about the tendons and joints, which is worse:  ""Cats' teeth are sharp and can penetrate very deeply. They can seed bacteria in the joint and tendon sheaths.  It can be just a pinpoint bite mark that can cause a real problem, because the bacteria get into the tendon sheath or into the joint where they can grow with relative protection from the blood and immune system.""  You do need to go to a doctor, or to Urgent Care, to get it properly disinfected and to get antibiotics.

76114	0	a	I really do hate to be *that guy* (girl) but as a vet tech who's seen it happen far too many times, I feel an obligation for a brief PSA. Sorry for highjacking top comment. Feel free to ignore/downvote me into oblivion, if it makes you happy to do so.   String is *very* dangerous for cats. Same goes with thread, ribbon... anything linear. If they chew on it, the hooks on their tongue can catch and they can end up swallowing it (even if they don't normally eat things). Any GI foreign body can be dangerous/expensive to treat, but *linear* foreign bodies have a much higher morality rate, especially in cats. (For anyone who's interested, the reason for this is that as strings move through the GI tract, parts can get caught while other parts continue to move - this causes what's called plication, or scrunching of the intestines. What happens after this is intestinal perforations, or tears in the intestines through which gastric contents leak into the abdominal cavity, causing septic peritonitis.)   Ok. PSA over. RIP karma...  (That cat is cute AF. I wish mine behaved that well when they knew they did something wrong. Usually they carry right on being jerks, but with direct/unwavering eye contact.)  Edit: to reword the description of what causes intestinal plication. 
76115	0	a	Underrated response, their claws are lethal. They often have bacteria and the remains of both waste and dead matter on them, so if you receive a particularly good scratch it can be infectious.   First time I had this happen to me, I was just 10 years old. It was a kitty next door.

76118	0	a	The first dog can smell that the other one didn't get the ear stuff. It knows the other dog got bamboozled
76119	0	a	Dogs have a sense of justice. I used to have three dogs. The oldest needed a daily pill so every night around 9pm I would cut up a hot dog in chunks and cut a slit in one to put the pill into. Of course the other two dogs *also* had to have a hot dog chunk. I eventually lost the older dog when he was 14-1/2, but I kept giving the other two dogs pieces of hot dogs every night at 9pm because they expected it.      So then I got a puppy near the end of January, and I was giving all three dogs pieces of hot dog around 9pm. But in early February one of my older dogs passed away, and then at the end of July I lost the other one. It's been a very difficult couple years. But every night my puppy gets some pieces of hot dog around 9pm and I think about my old boys.    **EDIT**      Wow, I *never* expected my little story to blow up like this. Thanks everyone! For anyone who may be interested, here are some photos of my late boys:       [Joshua, my first dog, on his 14th birthday](https://i.imgur.com/9f1fhGg.jpg). He died about 6 months later, Nov 29, 2016. This is the dog who actually *needed* to take a pill!         [This is Buddy and new puppy Jericho](https://i.imgur.com/DgeBj6T.jpg), at the end of January. Buddy passed away from kidney failure three days after this photo. Poor Jericho only got to know him for a few days but adored him, and for several days after Buddy passed Jericho would sleep in the spot where Buddy always slept.       [Harlan with puppy Jericho](https://i.imgur.com/om5uDhM.jpg). We lost Harlan 6 months later at the end of July due to bone cancer in the leg. Jericho was very fond of Harlan, too.       Poor Jericho loved both his big brothers and now he's an only child. And a big one, I don't have a current picture but he turned 9 months old a couple weeks ago and weighed in at 94 lbs!

76139	0	a	"You almost recreated a famous psychology experiment, though I definitely prefer your tradition.  The experiment was to see whether social pressure alone could influence someone into **not** pursuing pleasure.  It goes like this: the scientists tie a banana to the ceiling, out of reach of the monkeys unless they climb a ladder.  When one tried to climb this ladder, the researchers turned sprinklers on to get all the monkeys wet. The next time a monkey tried to climb a ladder the other monkeys attacked him, because monkeys *do not* like to be wet. The researchers took one monkey out and replaced him with a new one. George, never having been sprayed or attacked, tries to climb the ladder and is attacked by the four older monkeys and has no clue why. The researchers replace each of the initial monkeys in subsequent instances.   At the end of the experiment they have 5 monkeys who all refuse to go for something they desire. If they do, they know the others will attack them for it although none of them know why.  Tl;dr: researchers showed one way how ""It's just the way things are done around here"" situations can occur. Also that sometimes others will try to prevent you from getting your banana, either by attacking you or by careful planning and manipulation in the background.   Edit: now that I'm rereading your comment I realize the connection is tenuous but that's the first thing I thought of when I read your comment. "

76145	0	a	Approach this in steps...  Announce you are getting the medicine. Give a treat.   Go get the medicine, put it somewhere visible (and within sniff range). Give a treat and praise.   Open the medicine and invite dog over for a sniff. Give a treat and praise.   Touch medicine to dogs ear...no flinch equals treat and praise. Flinch equals wait 15 seconds and try again.   Work your way up, step by step. Bad behavior gets ignored. Good behavior gets treats and praise. Never punish or scold.   If you chase the dog, then that becomes the game. You will lose the game...every time.

76160	0	a	This is exactly correct. Rubbing a dogs ears like that is almost euphoric. Apparently it’s not at all uncommon for a dog to slip happily into a state of bliss when his ears are being rubbed. A rubbing, stroking motion stimulates the pituitary and hypothalamus glands which releases endorphins. The secretion of these feel-good, pain-killing hormones makes a dog feel relaxed to the point of blissfulness. Essentially, you are naturally tranquilizing your dog

76164	0	a	Yeah I have to use that stuff anytime my dog gets her ears wet, she pretty good about it.
76165	0	a	I know this doesn't apply to people to adopt adult rescues.   My dad taught us to gently play with and rub the paws, legs, ears and tails of our puppies so that they would be amicable to this kinda treatment later in life. We would hold the clippers and click them without actually touching the nails. Or we would fold, flop and play with their ears. After the fact edit: and play in an empty bath tub.  I did this with my dog when she was little and she doesn't even react when I have to trim her nails or check her ears for gunk.

I try to keep it exciting but he’s always at work in the winter w his dad, and guys don’t remember to post badass pictures to Instagram. Lol Glad you all like the video.  There’s no cliff, it’s off Ridge Run at Heavenly when he was working at Sky Patrol. Sometimes he just slides down the mountain at the end of the day, sometimes he jogs slowly side to side so it’s not hard on his body, other times he’s on the back of a sled or loads up on my bf’s shoulders.

So me and little Molly shared an apartment and after just a few days Molly started  to talk so much. She would hum really loud while she patrolled my perimeters, and when I opened the fridge she had her own sound for cucumbers, and a sound for carrots. She was a bit fucked up with anxiety after being neglected, but she would lay in my arms and just vibrate out of joy when we relaxed together (They have a very distinct ""purr""."

76318	0	a	Yes:( I know.. I had two twins after Molly. Molly died, and I grieved for a long time. I went to pet stores to try and help me process it, and there I found a herd of pigs and picked one out. (I didn't know at that time that they should always be at least two). And a few weeks after I went to the same pet store to buy feed for him, and noticed that one was left of the same herd I bought from (I have no idea if you even call it a herd, but I'm visiting English and so it is) anyway, I took that last one with me too. And took him home and put hum down on the floor next to that other one. And after just a few seconds they recognized each other and started screaming with joy, they snuggled, and played and started patrolling together. And slept together every night back to back. After two years I found one dead. The other was never himself and died three months later. I never had guinea pigs after that. Just writing this makes me so incredibly sad.

76439	0	a	For anyone wondering, it appears a strong motivation for food is at least partly what makes a dog very good for training. For example, Labrador guide dogs very commonly (something like 80% vs 20% in pet Labradors) have a gene mutation that makes them even more motivated by food than a normal Labrador.  [There's a lovely little Royal Institution talk that covers it (at 35:11 if it doesn't skip to the correct part).](https://youtu.be/pOJYTMe_bp4?t=2111)  EDIT: Re-arranged the first paragraph to make it a bit clearer.

76447	0	a	This isn't training him to ignore holes, but that the possibility of glass floors exists. My dog acted the same way when I exposed him to a pool, he tested it with his paws because he knew something was there, but that it was also see through.

76462	0	a	“Service dog in training” doesn’t mean this video is specifically training the dog with that tricky floor. Service animals are in training for years before they’re ready for the full-time job. More likely it is being taken through the whole museum as training to be calm and confident in that setting, and that glass floor happens to be a new challenge for doggo.
76463	0	a	My dog just did this in the river by my friends house. He's a golden and loves water.

We were both cold and grumpy after that.

76467	0	a	Good news, there's a 98.2% chance that your weight wouldn't be evenly distributed on that small beam and you would fall anyways!  Just consider the shattered balls full of glass shards as a bit of pre-fall foreplay.
76468	0	a	Also a bit of touch perception. Back foot feels like it's on something, must still be on the bar.
76469	0	a	That's a big reason why my dog accidentally falls in to the pool. Whizzes past corners forgetting that his back end takes a slightly different angle than the front. Either way, he loves being in the water, so it works out.

Not only do they do they have that fur to maintain but they are a working dog and need an active owner. They also like company so having just one is only a good option for people that have someone at home most of the time. They are stunning though.

Three headed doggo staring into my soul, Just waiting for the chance to make me whole, Go to the trunk pull out my sled, We start an adventure through a winter wonderland.

Must have been a site to see, an old heavily accented Norwegian with a very dark man from the south roving the field of nowhere MN and it was a chance for them to bond.  Makes me smile today knowing that even though there some real prices of trash out there making it look like we haven't advanced at all as a society, at one time a Norse mechanic and an ex-boxer from the deep south in the early 70's were out chasing deer.  Side note, he and my aunt ended up having beautiful daughters, nothing like Creole black and Norwegian to give you great skin and angular features, that part of the family was out in CA until only recently they moved back to the same pocket of MN.

Koko could comprehend 2000 words and sign over 1000. She would often sign how she wanted a baby but apparently she could not conceive, so her trainer gave her a kitten. The two were inseparable. It was her “baby”. The kitten got out one day and was hit by a car and killed. There is video of her being told and she was so upset and distraught she cried tears and grieved the loss just as you or I would. There is an awesome documentary on Netflix about her life. These animals are amazing. All animals are.

76587	0	a	He is a fully sentient being. He’s fully capable of understanding cause and effect, rationalizing, reasoning, and the concept of group identity vs the individual. Still, this guy, and similar (especially baboons) are hunted for pleasure, and not necessity. There is a list of how much it costs wealthy Americans to hunt each animal in Africa. I haven unfortunately seen this list, and the apes and primates are at the top.  Edit: Yes let’s change ‘fully’ to ‘highly.’ Sentient seems not to have been the most fitting word. Maybe sapient is closer to the right word. I think a word which means something in-between being able to perceive things, possessing self-awareness/identity, and being capable of asking questions would be a better fit.

But I do.  > I remember sitting with a group of chimps in an American zoo once. They had a really nice enclosure and I was watching the adults groom each other and the young ones play. As I watched, I remember thinking of the chimpanzee groups I had seen in the wild who are living day to day in fear. Put yourself in the position of chimpanzees for a minute. A chimp living in a zoo where people know them, love them, understand them and protect them or a chimp in the wild who may have lost their mother the week before, watching another member of the troop as they’re wounded by a bullet from a poacher. Which would you rather be? I’d rather be in the group in the zoo. And certainly in the group here at Monarto Zoo; now that’s a good life for a chimp.’""  Although, her main points against ""natural habitat"" were problems arisen due to a deforestation and human hunting them for meat and fur.

76636	0	a	This, so much. AZA accredited zoos are held to very strict standards of upkeep for the well being of their animals.  Zoos are a necessary evil to get people interested in how they can help our natural environments. The majority of people would care a whole lot less about wild animals if zoos weren’t around at all. It’s hard to create sympathy/a desire to help those that you never see outside of pictures.   At the very least in zoos, the keepers are doing everything they can to make sure their animals live as fulfilling a life as they can. Doing small things like putting tabasco sauce and nuts on random outcroppings in an elephant yard, or redesigning an enclosure to simulate an animal roaming like they would in the wild. There’s a lot of little things keepers and volunteers do to enrich the lives of the animals.  It kills me when I see people saying zoos are pure evil, when they do more for conservation and awareness than most people would realize.

76638	0	a	Trophy hunters are unsurprisingly some of the most (temporarily) wealthy amount us. They typically are addicted to hoarding money, have had an unnatural and often undeserved affluent lifestyle, and all family members/children/significant others are weighted (in the in the mind of the narcissist) on their ability to individually contribute to their narcissistic fantasies. Objectifying others, while disregarding the individual is decidedly narcissistic.   So, potentially deadly animals restricted  to them for execution, in a controlled setting (usually with fences)? The manufactured weakness and vulnerability are crack to the narcissist. They will send you pictures of themselves beaming like a school kid  who has finally been selected to star in this year’s play, next to a limp lifeless beast, with eyes which once held fire, and teeth which were the mortal end of many creatures who came before.

76644	0	a	Fun facts: Most primates tend to be the closest we can get to having straight up conversations with non humans thanks to sign language and the primates ability to learn them.   The most interesting part about talking to primates, the thing that separates us most from them, is that they have never asked a question. A similar situation can be observed in very young children, under the age of 4. They tend not to ask questions at early ages, but by the age of 4, the brain develops enough that they begin asking questions.    And it's not like the idea of questions is completely foreign to either of them. Primates get asked questions all the time, and they reply with answer all the time.   So the thing that separates us from animals is that we ask questions.

Alex has many achievements, like asking a question, understanding the concept of zero, inventing words, being able to distinguish and use  “I” and “you” within a language structure. Being able to from very simple but grammatically correct sentences like “Wanna go ....” “wanna eat....”. But imo the most impressive part is how smart he was compared to other parrots within the same study. Alex was a part of a large study group.

When the handler says that famous line, an homage to the original moment, the audience is amused... momentarily. ""Ha, I remember that reference!""  Then as Caesar screams that single word, with such conviction and rage, everyone is dumbstruck. The rest of the apes, the handler and most important of all, the people in the theater everyone falls dead silent. A cinematic masterpiece.

He was normally very obedient, but when baby toes were in the house, no matter what we did, he could not resist incessantly licking those toes when we weren’t looking. He looked so guilty but couldn’t stop himself. We finally gave up and the babies loved it.  He died 4 years ago and I still cry sometimes missing him so much.

Don't leave them unsupervised with a baby but make them feel loved and welcomed and that nothing has changed for them except that noisy creature you brought home.   I feel that most dogs in a good, happy, safe home are quite happy to allow new members into their family as long as they are not suddenly made to feel like second class citizens in their own homes.  Dogs, I think, need to be treated very much like older siblings when a baby comes home.  Mommy and Daddy still love you very much and you are a good boy :)
76720	0	a	This makes me so happy and sad at the same time.  My wife and I had the same moment with our twins and dog, she loved them and was always around for playtime and to be a pillow for them to sleep on, she would give them kisses when they cried and watch over them while they slept.  But unfortunately as she aged the vets believe she got severe early onset dementia or Alzheimer's, she began acting erractic and bit both of my twins so bad we had to take them to the hospital and because of this we had to put her down but when I went to see her at the vet after the rabies tests were done on the day we were to put her to sleep she was her normal self, happy to see me and jumping and I help her close is my arms as she licked me one last time and I cried into her as she stuck her tongue out when she fell asleep for the last time.  I miss my dog and these moments and I'm sorry if this comment isnt meant for here but I miss her and I just wanted to talk about her one more time and tell people that she was a good girl.  Edit to my comment: My apologise for just putting a sad story and not following up with some positivity!  Also to follow up, she was in quarantine for 7 days, which I thought meant they were running tests, I guess they removed her brain after she was put to sleep. My apologies for not making that clearer.  As for happy, she used to go into my boys rooms at 8 am every day and sniff their feet until they woke up, it got to the point where they started getting up and waiting for her. She would also just follow then around while they scooted around on their little 4 wheel baby scooters and chase them down, when they would stop and turn around she would look at them and then run away and wait for them to chase her.

76722	0	a	I’ll be a downer too, but it seems like this dog is a bit anxious. Whale eye, little tongue flicks, all signs of anxiety. That being said, hopefully it’s just that these parents know their dog better than anybody and I’m wrong. :)   It took my pup a little while to completely be comfortable with my baby around and we made sure to have only supervised, positive interactions/associations between the two. Two years in, they’re total bros now (and still always supervised).

She followed my daughter around when she was a toddler and let out a huffy little woofs when she would fall. Sometimes my daughter would just go to sleep on the dog and I would find them in a big pile on the living room floor; a little tiny girl and a massive beast sleeping. We would go outside often and joke that we could probably leave her out there with the dog, nobody would mess with her and our pup would let us know if we were needed. Rotts live too short of lives however and I feel your pain. We miss our good girl all the time.  Thanks for reminding me about the toe licking.

God I miss that sweet pup.

Uma [our gsd] went along, as she was super protective of kids.   He started shooting, and she nearly bolted.

If they were arguing or something, he would run up to them and get in there as if to calm down the situation. My cousin's came to stay for a few weeks and the youngest who was only 3 or 4 at the time, when we would go for walks he would stand right beside her the entire way. Off leash, just walking right next to her and following her wherever she went. The funny thing is that he was about the same height as her, so it was like she was walking with this giant dog.

76782	0	a	Ours did something similar, though it was with a friend’s baby. She has an issue with jumping up or getting too excited when people come over and we’ve gotten her past most of it with training, but she still gets super bouncy as Boxers do. A friend brought over their 3mo old in a car seat and our dog treated it like a revered diety. She would only approach it by belly crawling over and kept looking at us with watery eyes like it was the most beautiful thing she’d ever seen and wouldn’t let us near it until they left.  Kid turned out to be an asshole, so she may have just been protecting us. Either way, good dog.
76783	0	a	My friend has an aussie mix that absolutely loves herding us. Whenever we're walking around with the dog it's constantly circling back and making sure everyone stays together. I can only imagine how adorable it must be watching one herd toddlers.

I need to be there so I can ask the kids to give him a break when he's uncomfortable (which never happens. But I'm there just in case).

I choose to not put myself in that position by keeping them separated until he's older and knows how to interact with animals besides squealing, chasing, and flailing his arms at them.

I was actually a couple of weeks pregnant at that point, I am worried about what the future holds.  My dog clearly does not think I am parent material, and she was pooped after a few hours...

76813	0	a	dogs have an instinct to treat any living thing of a certain size as a pup. there is an age delineation with toddlers of a certain height that they stop treating them gently and can in fact begin posing a danger in play because they will treat them as adults. of course, youd need to have a big, powerful dog that isn't well trained to pose such an unintentional threat.

That little bastard would swipe your keys if you set them on the table or counter and walked away from them, promptly hide said keys, and then climb up on to a bookcase and sit there, never moving with the most smug little look on his weasel face while he watched you tear apart the apartment for your missing keys.

76876	0	a	Mine will climb on the suitcase and hunch and meow and look generally pitiful whenever we take it out of the closet. She will hide in it if it’s open and give you stink eye when you pass.   The nervous ankle biting and tremulous crying starts as soon as she sees us stacking clothes or folding the baby play yard. She will sit on any coats or backpacks stacked by the door too. It makes it so hard to concentrate on packing. She knows what she’s doing. She will start laying on and covering your shoes too. Anything to make it difficult to leave.

76878	0	a	Our recent kitten is slightly scary.  A few days after we got her, she was already using one of her cat toys to explore under things she couldn’t fit under.  When we put her in a cage we had for my aunt’s dog for a while to help the (older, but much more paranoid) other cat get used to her, she pretty quickly worked out where the latch was for the door, and was trying to get at it from inside the cage. She couldn’t, it was too awkward, but she definitely knew how it opened.  Recently she’s taken to following my parents when they go for a walk. When she saw them putting on coats, she rushed out the cat flap in the side door, over the gate and round to the front for them to come out it the front door. She knew we’d stop her from going out th front door, so she went round.  She’s too smart and too fearless. Fortunately, she doesn’t like going outside much without one of us with her, so we’re not too worried.
76879	0	a	One of my kitties has figured out that rattling my keys means I'm going outside. So she follows me out and does her toileting (she hates doing her business indoors despite fresh, clean litterboxes)  and I stand guard and protect her from predators (other cats, that bastard blackbird and possibly hedgehogs if it's dark) whilst she poops.   The other stripey kitty has figured out my keys have a laser torch, when he hears my keys rattling he comes running up and begs for a game of chase the red dot.

76883	0	a	My cat figured that out with the suitcase as well. I've been living in a different state than my boyfriend and cat for the last 4 months since I landed a new job, and so I've been going back monthly to visit. After the 3rd time she figured out that when mom puts the suitcase in the living room, it means she's leaving again. She sits on it and meows furiously. It makes me so sad.   BUT, this next time, she's coming back with me (cat on airplane being a whole other set of issues I'm sure). We're moving next week. So even though I still travel every other week for work, I'll only be gone for a day or two at a time rather than full weeks at a time. 
76884	0	a	A horse did this to me once. I delivered hay in a truck and dropped it in the field for it. He stood in front of me when I tried to leave. In my mind I was like, “Haha! Dumb horse! It’s a field so I’ll just put it in reverse!” Nope..he thought of that and ran around to the back. It was about 5 minutes of me going backwards, forwards, sideways and the horse calling my bluff about running it over, before I got out of the truck. The horse then showed me that I was supposed to feed it and then I was allowed to leave.

Now they have their own glass on the counter in the bathroom. One cat started stealing wash cloths out of the hamper. I bought more wash cloths and now on laundry day swap ""hers"" for one from the hamper. She always gets excited to get a fresh (to her) wash cloth. Many of my window shades are permanently up about a third of the way because the cats like to look out the windows. And then there's the feline sized blanket my mom crocheted for one of my cats for Christmas this year so that she (the cat) wouldn't be upset when I put her (again, the cat's) favorite blanket away for the summer.   Similarly, my sister's family's dog love rocks. She won't chase a tennis ball or stick that you throw but will wear herself out chasing rocks. So, every time I visit I bring her a new rock. For Christmas, I wrapped up three rocks in a box and she thought it was the ultimate bestest present ever in the world.    My family's pets are weirdos. But they're our weirdos.   "
76912	0	a	It's a bittersweet reality really... one of my beloved felines used to hide toys and small rocks or the dogs kibble in my shoes... only my shoes.... so I got used to emptying my shoe before putting it on. After he died i would catch myself doing it and be so sad. Now my son hides rocks... cat kibbles.... small toys .... in my shoes and I have to empty them.out and it makes me smile and think of my fluffball.  Other things I do for current cats.... cover all plastic wrapped items like cases of water so the licker doesn't lick it until he's sick. Or ensuring there is a kitty friendly staircase up to our bed and window sills etc for my little old lady cat.   The... this is my life now.... for my cat..... happens too often
76913	0	a	I was this kid in school. I felt like such a burden to my teacher and classmates but I couldn’t have ever learned otherwise. If it’s like my family, the answer is either: we can’t afford glasses, we can’t afford a second pair cause our daughter lost the first, or we’re just neglectful and don’t realize glasses are not optional for our child. The first time I had glasses on and saw how sharp the clouds truly were was unforgettable and life changing; literally a new world.    Thank you so much for accommodating your students!

76917	0	a	I’m throwing up. I hate you for making me notice this.
76918	0	a	Love this. I grew up in a rural town with a good deal of property around without other homes or major roads. There were 3 farms within a mile of us though and they all had plenty of cats- None of which really took proper care of them. They would have kittens, the kittens would get sick and be in the middle of our little back road basically dying (horrible I know). My family and I really couldn't stomach this, (as would be the same for anyone with a heart) so my mom would collect them from the road, nurse them back to health and try to find them good homes. We however could not do this for all of the kittens she saved, so we ended up with plenty (to the point where we just stated numbering them instead of naming them). They were mostly all outdoor cats, because you just can't have all of those cats in the house, but at least they got fed, fixed, and proper medical attention when they needed it. We even had a cat hotel (as we called it), which was an old shed that was fixed up by my dad specifically for the cats so the cats would have somewhere to go to get out of the weather if need be. Anyway, I say all that to say this. When it was time for breakfast or dinner, my mom would go outside and do her here kitttttyyyyy kittty kitty thing (hard to type a rolling tongue, but I'm sure most of you know what I mean) and it was quite a sight to see 20 something cats come running out of the woodwork from all different corners of the property ready to get their breakfast and dinner.   Sorry for any typos, tried my best but mobile is a pain. 
76919	0	a	We had the same situation at my home.  My mom recorded herself calling for the cat so we could play it back through speakers to get the cat inside.

76921	0	a	I loved reading this. We had to put my cat down on Monday after having her for 17 years and it’s so nice to hear about other people’s experiences with their kitty. My cat used to have a collar with a bell on it so I’d know where she was at (master at sneaking up on you). One day I heard the bell then I didn’t. She had taken her collar off and hid it (under my bed). She did it every single time until I gave up. The collar is still under my bed years later.   I miss her so much.   [EDIT]: This is [Tally. ](http://i.imgur.com/K0y3C75.jpg)    And when I’d tell her [to stick her tongue back in. ](http://i.imgur.com/mKxwnWo.jpg) She’d do a little huffing noise (like I was annoying her) then turn her back to me lol

76925	0	a	i started sleeping through some alarms a couple years ago. then one morning i woke up a little early, but stayed in bed until the alarm went off, only to see one of my cats jumping up and swiping at my phone.   effectively turning my alarm off. then she laid back down next to me and went back to sleep.   now i set multiple alarms.

76928	0	a	So, I raised a kitten for my ex (long story but she didn't have time or resources to take care of it for a while there)... A little orange tabby tomcat. Very smart.  If I didn't wake up by 7:30am to feed him breakfast and find a box for him to play in, I got my NOSE bitten you guys. Hard. He even drew some blood a couple times. No scratches, no meows, no nudges, just a bite on the nose while I'm deadass asleep. I have no idea how he seized onto that idea. Nobody taught him that and he wasn't very mouthy otherwise.
76929	0	a	My cat does the same thing! Occasionally I’ll use my phone alarm as a timer for the oven. I’m just trying to make dinner and he thinks it’s cuddle time! I feel awful about leading him on like that so I’ll hold off on my dinner for a few minutes to give him some love.
76930	0	a	When I started having to work in an office, my two big boy cats became my littlest nopes. As soon as my alarm went off, both would snuggle up and place their paws firmly on my chest. “Nope, Hooman - just nope!” - I did the same as the OP, and they loved their ‘extra’ half hour cuddle.
76931	0	a	When I was in kindergarten, I was a tiny kid (smallest in my class).  We had this big black-and-white cat who would sit up on my chest so I couldn’t sit up.

It used to be that the relationship was merely parent and child, but now once children mature they become friends and hang out and do stuff together. I know my parents are my best friends and my older sister says the same thing.

I felt so different from others and this experience helped me feel just like everyone else.

Whereas before, young people were just little money machines, now children and teens are allowed to develop in their own right.

77021	0	a	I have a 15mo old and I turned 27 today. The parents in my age group.. it just makes me happy. It makes me worry less. We are shackled with so much bullshit but our hearts are still light. I don’t know if I’m concerned about overbearing parents- don’t forget we’re the “everybody gets a trophy” generation... a concept our parents implemented and now mock us for on a daily basis.  It will be even better I think when Gen Z starts to have children. Anger and hatefulness exist but they’re being cast aside for something more. I don’t know, it just renews some of my lost hope.

77027	0	a	Exactly. Even for the previous generation I'd say like only half the population had a real close bond with their parents. I'm 21 and it seems like most people my age do everything with their parents first and then friends second. You'd think that with phones and technology that it would drive a wedge but it seems familial ties have only gotten stronger which is awesome. Purely based off of what I've seen but it really gives me hope for future generations to be more caring for each other which is what the world needs right now.

Think of it like this: When elderly and/or unemployed people want to get out of the house during the day to waste time or get away from (or deceive) their spouses, they go to the park. Several such folk often play board games (like chess, checkers) together on park benches or picnic tables, returning daily to settle the previous day's score.  Eclipse is just a furry-person that goes to the park every day to play doggo-games with all the other furry-person regulars.

If he goes in somewhere and doesn't get a treat? No problem--he'll just sit there politely with a derpy smile on his face, tail going a-mile-a-minute until he gets one.

There are hundreds of stories of dogs going to the school gate just at the time their kid gets out, or waits expectantly at the door when it's almost time for the owner to get home, ect.

The good thing usually ends when a random jerk tries to take advantage inappropriately, or complains unnecessarily.  It does my heart good that sometimes, people can just be neighborly and allow a harmless exception.

77149	0	a	Seattle person here. I once had a man wearing a domino mask and a knitted cap with fox ears tell me I smelled good at a bus stop. Also at a bus stop a woman was wearing hypodermic needles in her hair like chopsticks. We once evacuated a bus because someone was shouting death threats, like everyone​ tiptoed out and got onto another bus, then the new bus driver had to shut the doors of the newly boarded bus so they couldn't get on. Our bus once passed a fully dressed my little brony talking to a tuba player in lederhosen. I can't count the amount of times buses have honked at someone literally dancing in the street.  Yeah, bus culture is weird here. But I'd still swoon over a bus riding doggo.

77211	0	a	“As many of you know Cinder was relinquished to our hospital last week. We are fortunate that Purina has offered to help us with her care. We will be fundraising for our Good Samaritan fund - stay tuned for the details. This fund is used exclusively to pay for veterinary care for clients who could otherwise not afford it.   It is important to feed a prescription weight loss food to a pet that is this overweight because it is balanced nutritionally to avoid essential nutrient deficiencies that can happen on a weight loss program.  Many people have wondered why we are subjecting Cinder to the underwater treadmill. Cinder has arthritis in multiple joints and is carrying an extra 10 lb of body weight. The water provides a reduced weight-bearing environment that increases functional use of limbs without marked weight loading and resultant discomfort to  joints. She's still in the process of becoming acclimated to this treadmill and the water level is lower than we would like just so she can become used to the process.”   EDIT; I’ve set up a YouTube channel where I can post regular update videos for anybody who is interested in Cinderblocks continuing weight loss journey. The channel is “Cinder Gets Fit” on YouTube. Only one video has been uploaded but I will add more soon! 🖤

It seeps into the lawnmower parts or something and when I turn it on, it smells so bad I want to (and do) cry.   I’ve tried to trap it (humanely) 18 times over the past 5 years to no avail, it is clearly intellectually advanced.   Please come take it away. PLEASE.

Corn Gluten meal is literally pure protein and yes, it is in fact digestible by cats; it is digested in the same way as Fish Meal.  Ahh, but of course- they must be paid off by big pet food.

One otherwise normal day, I went to drag said garbage can out to the pickup area.   There was a baby possum all cozy on top of the garbage bags.   So me, being a conscientious animal appreciator, took said can out towards the woods in my backyard. I gently lowered it down so that the opossum baby could scamper away. It did scamper away, but not before HISSING AT ME LIKE THE UNGRATEFUL AND RUDE BASTARD IT APPARENTLY WAS

77330	0	a	I'm a Grinch when it comes to babies, but this one warmed my cold heart.
77331	0	a	"How old is that baby?  I'm using my alt account to say I am crying, but not because of how cute it is, but because I am so tired and jealous. My baby is 2 months today, he has the same dino onsie. It's been such a struggle. He hasn't smiled yet (he's close though) and either he is sleeping or crying. Some days are better than others, but the colic... My husband and I are broken. I want to be able to laugh and play with my baby but it feels like I'll never get there. I'm praying to see that level of play and interaction in my son someday , but right now I'm in hell. They say it gets better... I just want him to smile. And to sleep. And to interact with me. And not to scream for hours.  I love him so much, I just want him to be okay, not miserable. We're all miserable right now.  I know all babies are different and my son is at the peak age of fussiness, but seeing GIFs like these reminds me of how I thought motherhood would be vs how it is, how lonely and tired I am, how scared I am for my husband's sanity, how my baby is nothing like this baby.   I would kill to have this moment with my son.   And I can't stop crying.   EDIT: Wow, thank you all for your love and support. So many hugs!! I feel less alone right now, thank you internet humans. It's tough, since we don't have any family in state, and I'm alone with him all day. Although logically I know it's a newborn phase and it will be over soon, having *so* many positive replies has given me some hope on this dark day. I don't usually post ""poor me"" replies, but this gif was like a punch in the stomach and I had to get it off my chest. Everyone says it gets better, I have to believe that. Thank you for reading. "

I was sitting there watching him play with a snack and out of nowhere he develops a skill that no other animal in the world can do.

77343	0	a	As a new mother to a now 7 month old. This.   It’s amazing watching babies learn the most basic things. 
77344	0	a	A book I once read (*Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?*) mentioned that as an example - if a family is at the kitchen table and the father suddenly starts floating towards the ceiling, the baby just looks at it, sees it, and treats it as yet another thing way out of its comprehension it's facing every day. But the mother would go absolutely batshit crazy what's happening right now. Obviously the book then goes down a very different route from that thought but I've always liked that little story due to the many implications that come from it even if it's not a groundbreaking new idea.
77345	0	a	People should save this and watch it when they start to feel gloomy.
77346	0	a	lol pregnant crying is real. When my wife was pregnant she cried about anything. Such as  1 - She couldn't decide if she wanted to make herself a ham sandwich with mayo or butter.  2 - I took a bite of a cheese string without peeling it first.   3 - She couldn't decide if she needed to cry or not. Spoiler: she did.  4 - There wasn't enough hot water for her to take 2 separate baths half an hour apart  5 - I finished the leftovers in the fridge while she was out with a friend. She had left me a note asking me to finish said leftovers. I apologized profusely.

And the random crying when you look at the baby and he/she is just so wonderful and you start crying.... The most weepy year of my life. The happiest too. 
77350	0	a	Watching Bird Box with my wife over the weekend, at one of scenes near the end involving the kids I hear my pregnant wife say “I’m so fucking pregnant!” and I look to my left and she’s just bawling haha.   I didn’t think it was that emotional of a scene, but hey I’m not pregnant!
77351	0	a	Did it grow three sizes today?
77352	0	a	Pediatrician here   You are doing fine!    Most babies will have spontaneous smiling at birth (as in randomly) but don't develop a social smile until about 4 months of age. At 2 months a baby's  vision isn't even that great, they can fixate on an object but don't really respond to smiling.  A social smile is when a person smiles and then they smile back.   This baby looks about 4-5 months but hard to say without examining him.   Moments like this make me  glad that I can use my training to help parents like you !
77353	0	a	Colic is absolutely soul crushing and you aren't alone in your feelings. One of my kids cried nonstop 22 hours a day for the first year of his life.  I honestly didn't believe that I'd ever be happy again.   Things got better, I swear. Be kind to yourself, and if you can find someone to hold your crabby mcscreamface for a while so you can sleep/eat/breathe/cry etc, LET THEM.  Best of luck to you. I hope in a year all his colic seems like a bad dream. 
77354	0	a	Take it easy! That baby is at least 3 months old. Some have it easy, some don't. I can't say anything to make you feel better except that your time will come. They can't be babies forever, and there's literally no correlation between unhappy baby and unhappy child / adult. Some babies are just assholes, and sounds like yours is just your run of the mill prize asshole! Our little asshole started smiling at 8/9 weeks, and we were also super nervous. He's now 14 weeks and can't stop smiling. That first smile will happen for you, and when it does, you'll realise that all those nights trying to pacify a douchey child is actually worth it! 
77355	0	a	"Oh, I wish I could hug you. I have been exactly where you are. Twice. I can tell you from personal experience and from anecdotal experience with all of my mommy friends that 12 weeks is just about the point where you are past the very worst of it. That is usually the magic number after which baby sleeps an hour more and then another hour etc.....And very very slowly your baby will pay you back in daytime giggles and even some play. You are SO close. Hang in there. Also, talk to your PCP about getting some help for postpartum anxiety/depression. It is EXTREMELY common and most of us get/got help way later when you really need it right away. The PPA/PPD is accelerated and intensified by your insane lack of sleep and all the worry that comes with a baby that just won't stop crying. Your anxiety levels are likely nonstop. Getting some medication to help your brain retain the serotonin levels.   As for the colic......my youngest cried nonstop and was only happy when upright and snuggled into my chest and no other chest. It was so much pressure and so exhausting. She was hysterical if I ever put her down or handed her off, even to her daddy. We couldn't figure out what, other than the attachment, was the issue. Well, it turned out to be silent reflux. It's crazy painful, gets intensified with every feeding and makes baby not want to lay down, let alone sleep, ever. Talk to your pedi about it. I wish you much strength and the best of luck!   .....try not to punch everyone who tells you to ""enjoy every second""."

77358	0	a	My son is three. There are definitely things I don’t miss about the newborn stage, like middle of the night feedings and screaming since he can’t communicate what he wants, but I do miss the snuggly baby stage. I also miss him staying where I put him instead of climbing the counter, getting the strawberry Nesquik, and dumping it out on the floor so he can lick it up like the dogs.

77360	0	a	Also amazing is after you have more kids, the new baby will learn \*better\* and faster from the older one. My youngest of 3 is a month younger than his cousin. Mine can walk, my sister's baby not walking yet. We got together for Christmas and \*bam\* older cousin sees baby walking and starts walking.  Kids often dont really \*understand\* they CAN do a thing until they see another kid do it. Then its like a switch is turned on. Just \*believing\* something is possible makes learning actually happen, it seems.
77361	0	a	My son doesn't understand size and shape differences yet. He's got these cups that are designed to fit inside of each other in a stack, and while he understands they stack, he can't figure out why they only work in one direction. He'll spend a minute trying to fit a giant cup inside of a tiny one and then freak out about it not working.  I thought that sort of ability to compare size was instinctive, put apparently not.
77362	0	a	This is so well said. It’s literally the thoughts that they can’t say out loud as they discover this amazing new thing for the first time. 
77363	0	a	Honestly, this is me, as a 27 year old man.  I grew up a 5 minute walk away from the Long Island Sound and about a 20-30 min drive from the Atlantic Ocean. In the summers, from ages 3-18 or so, I was in the water almost every day.  This past year, I started working at a company that’s about a 10 minute drive from the Long Island Sound, but on the Connecticut side. Last summer I went swimming every day after work, after barely getting in the water for nearly five years.   Every time I went swimming, there was always at least one moment when I’d suddenly feel keenly aware of the way that the water bends around my arms and shoulders, and would just feel compelled to stare at it. 20+ years later, I still feel the same inexplicable wonder at how beautiful water is. It was a feeling that I’d totally forgotten and, when I lived on Long Island, had totally taken for granted.   I know it’s pretty inconsequential, in the grand scheme of things. But water is remarkably conducive to relaxation. Doesn’t matter if your a toddler in the sink or a grown ass person on an empty beach after work.

One day I heard whispering in the hall and then my 9 year old come into the room and give me a hug. I told him it was sweet but I just wanted to be alone and he goes ""I know you do. Dad made me come in here to make sure you're okay. He said he doesn't know what to do and he doesn't want to get yelled at again.""  I also bawled my eyes out during a parent teacher interview when the teacher said my kid had friends. I knew he had friends but for some reason that sent me into ugly crying mode. I just kept pointing to my belly and blubbering ""it's this fault""."

Its the same thing for language, motor and social development.  If you have any questions about your child's development make sure to bring it up with your pediatrician during their well visit.   Good luck to you !

77396	0	a	I agree! I found it very wonderful. Hes not super touchy either so to see him spend the whole pregnancy trying extra hard to make me happy and comfortable was really special. I really appreciate all he did.  Then again, one week when I was really down he thought he should bring home a kitten. Cause obviously I would want something else to care for (and be allergic over). Thank God he didnt, but the thought was nice.

77414	0	a	This is awesome my dad was a mailman and always kept treats in his mail truck for the dogs on his route. Years after he had retired I was having x mas dinner at my cousin in law and a older neighbor lady that was now alone since her husband passed away was joining us and she kept saying u look familiar too me and we couldn't figure it out since am pretty sure i have never seen her. Well later on she said o I got go back home and let the dog out and the kids wanted to go over and play with dog since my daughter was one and am a animal lover I join them. The dog was waiting at the window and was getting all worked up as we were walking up. She opens the door dog dodges threw the kids and is just going nuts on me running around me and jumping. I look at the older lady and she is tearing up saying that's it you look like the last mailman we had I haven't seen her act like this since he stop delivering here she loved him it was the joy of her day. She literally went thru like depression when he retired. We then figured it out after she showed me a picture she took showing my dad and dog that my dad was her mailman. My dad and I  would stop over from time to time to visit and take the dog for a walk. Unfortunately about 2 years later the dog passed away. But she was so thankful she said seeing her dog being happy to end meant the world to her.

77429	0	a	When I was a mail carrier I would hang with the good dogs on my route and give them treats. My favorite was Sassy. She would see me across a very busy street when she was outside and start howling. It was a long relay so it took awhile before I got over to her. When I did, she would come great me and we’d hang out for a minute while she enjoyed her treat. I miss that dog. 
77430	0	a	When you make a quick visit to someone's house and then leave, dogs tend to think 'I successfully scared that unsavory character!' and will keep doing it.   If you greeted the dog every day with a treat and some pets the dogs are gonna love you forever lmao. I used to be drinking buddies with a postman, who kept a wholesale-sized back of milk bones in his truck for exactly this reason! 
77431	0	a	I'd like to add that it was also done gently and purposefully. He didn't just toss the package without a care.

Within a couple minutes one was purring and the other was playing tug-o-war with me. We played that little game all the time. She loved it.    Then we adopted a kitten. The gf was super excited and sat with him in the bathroom for hours. The cat was meant to be hers so I stayed away and let them bond a bit. I went in to see our(well, my cat now) kitty. The moment I sat down he curled up in my lap and went to sleep. My ex was pissed. She adopted him, he adopted me.    I have absolutely no idea why. Animals just typically love me.

77472	0	a	I got myself a Basset Hound when I left my parents home, previously I had a German shepherd which I trained in my teens. Their character is quite different, one being a Hound and the other a Shepherd. On holidays at my parent's I took them both on a hike.   The basset, as per usual tries to go in front tracking small prey ,which he does sometimes, even though I don't hunt, and he just stands there looking at the rabbit/mice when eventually he gets one out of hiding. That day he went and ran way too far.   So I told my long-haired German Shepherd to go fetch him, he starts running and cuts right in front of the Basset's way looking at him. The small-legged Basset stops, looks at him and then tries to pass under the shepherd's watch, the shepherd barks at him and then the Basset comes running back to me.   From then on, everytime the Basset would look like he would get away from near me,  the German Shepherd would run in front of him and bring him back.  Genetics and instincts are something amazing.

77482	0	a	Aww. I had a gf years ago who had an old arthritic dog and and old cat with a bit of dementia. The dog barely moved unless you asked him where the cat was. He'd somehow get up and no matter where the cat had gone,  indoor or out, he'd have her at your feet in short time. It was the sweetest damn thing I've ever seen.   Edit: glad folks like this, still gives me the warm and fuzzies too. Few answers:  1) dementia cat: no official diagnosis, but would get lost and we'd often find her gazing off into nothing. It's what we called it. She also stopped grooming herself but would still groom the dog... She had issues.  2) gf was just slightly crazier than the cat, her parents very much so. Took a bit but once I realized it I ended it, thought it took a few months for her to stop calling and acting like everything was fine...  3) it was decades ago, the cat and dog would both be over 30, so they've likely both passed away.
77483	0	a	My sheltie would protect our cats. I grew up on a small family farm and we always had “farm cats” who lived in the barns or sheds and who were “our” cats even though they were semiwild. Most would let you hold or pet them but you couldn’t bring them inside or even put them in a car to go to the vet without them freaking out.  But our dog knew which cats were allowed and which weren’t and she’d protect them other cats in the area and chase the unauthorized cats off. If our cats got into a fight with an “outsider” cat, then our dog would either break it up or else the cats would run to her for protection. 
77484	0	a	Dogs must love controlling cats lol. My cat used to be allowed outside, but he kept getting beat up by one of the neighborhood strays so I keep him in now. My dog picked up on it pretty quick and now whenever the cat tries to ninja his way out a door, the dog is right there stopping him in his tracks.
77485	0	a	I just had the worst walk ever with my husky. Ever. She acted like a fucking adolescent teenage girl the whole time. If I tried to walk one way she pulled me the other. I wanted to go to the wooded trail walkway, she tried to pull me to the rich houses that are next to it so she could shit on their lawn while they shoot daggers at me as they're going out to their cars to leave for work at 7am. If I tried to pick up her poop, she waited til I was bent over and then yanked the leash. When we started heading home she walked 5 feet behind me until I smacked her butt and told her to walk in front of me and stop being weird. Most days she's slightly a pain in the ass... this morning she was trying to piss me off. I wish I had a helpful husky. And I'm gonna tell her all about this, that some huskies aren't a pain in the ass.

Best part us after a dozen escapes or so, you don't need to go get the dog. We can just step outside and say ""find the kitten"" and the CAT sprints back inside, because it has learned it cannot escape the dog. So we trained our cats to come back inside peacefully."

77535	0	a	It’ll be a year tomorrow since Weez went to the vet to begin his weight loss journey - comprised of monthly weigh ins and consultations. He’s officially lost six pounds and feeling like a new cat. 20lbs to 14lbs!  Edit: I’m trying to get through the comments! Weez has been eating Royal Canin Satiety Support for the past year - a mix of wet food, dry food and treats. his original plan was 1/4 cup three times a day and now he’s on two 1/4 cup servings a day. I sometimes reserve some of his dry food to throw down the hall for a late night snack or he’ll get a bit more food if he’s still hungry. slow and steady wins the race! pro tip: my vet recommends lots of cat nip! it’s low calorie and gives the feeling of eating a treat.  he gets weighed every six weeks and they review his progress and mealplan. for exercise, I mostly throw food or treats down the hallway but I’ve also taught him to catch them in his mouth (or maybe it’s the chonkiness?) so he’s always moving! he also loves toys featuring feather on strings and wire, laser pointing (for two minutes before he’s annoyed), and he especially loves Target scratch houses. gotta get those reps in.   best of luck to all of you with your own chonkers out there trying to lose weight! it isn’t easy; Weez went through a few different diet plans before we found something to keep the weight off. his brother is so slim and eats the same amount, making it really hard to try to have one cat gain and one cat lose.   thank you for all of the love! I assure you that Weez will get a headscratch and cuddles for each comment. he’s a very good boi who loves giving kisses and cuddling up to his people.

77556	0	a	While I have not had to so drastically reduce the weight of a chonker, some common tips are to try feeding them in separate rooms so one of them doesn't steal food. Wet food is also good for weight loss for cats because they get more full on water as opposed to just a bunch of crunchy calories. 
77557	0	a	Tip our vet told us for cats who are very food motivated and not very willingly mobile: don't feed them by just putting food in their bowl. Toss individual pieces down a hallway or across a larger room. They run to eat the piece, run back to you for more, lather, rinse, repeat.

I only feed him the amount on the bag (his sister gets the same and they both hork it down, so no food stealing) and he definitely likes his 3 a.m. zoomies and he plays and has no issues getting to where he needs to be. I still wouldn't mind if he lost 2-3 pounds. Bah. (Meanwhile, otra kitty is 5 pounds sopping wet and doesn't appear to ever gain weight. Both of us secretly hate her for this but she's' too cute to hate for long lol)  Edit: thank you kind Reddit stranger! My first silver!"

77567	0	a	You can end the laser chase with a toy, so they get 'prey' at the end, but just using a piece of string with something bouncy is probably a better option.
77568	0	a	When I worked at a vet clinic, one of the vets told me the amount on the bag is actually about 25% more than the amount the animal actually needs. So take the amount on the back and cut it back by 1/4! Also free feeding is the devil. When my cat was a kitten I free fed her (she was a very sick feral when I first found her and was very underweight) but as she got older and especially after she got spayed she started chonking out baaaad. Probably was pushing 15+ pounds at her heaviest. So I took away the free feeder and now she gets 1/4 cup twice per day. She has since lost about 2-3 pounds. She also loves chasing the laser! Cats aren’t like dogs where you can exercise them for like an hour or more at a time. Cats tend to exercise in “bursts” of five to ten minutes. We play with the laser for 2-3 sessions per day and I think that also really helped.   Edit: yes i know I am very bad at math
77569	0	a	Do you know how many calories a cat is supposed to get? I’ve googled it and I get conflicting information so I’m lost. Trying to get my 14 pounder to 12 pounds with high quality wet food. 
77570	0	a	Check out catinfo.org.   I swear by that entire site, I got my 16 pound cats down to 12-13 pounds and my vet couldn't believe it.  She had tried for 3 years to get hers to lose weight unsuccessfully.  IIRC, it's about 10-15 calories per pound for a cat, so if your cat should be 10 pounds it's somewhere between 100-150 calories.  Cans and bags should have the calories listed, if not then it's likely online.  Do the quick math and only feed that much per day.  Eventually they will get to ideal weight. 
77571	0	a	Thank you for the tip! Did you have any problems with your cat waking you up begging for more? Mine taps my face while I try to sleep, and when I don’t give him more, actually bites me. He’s such a fat jerk but I love him.   Edit- cat not car, lol

77594	0	a	I read somewhere that this is a learned behavior from thousands of years of having dogs as hunting partners. The same way they understand humans pointing with their hands and other animals don’t, dogs learned various ways of nonverbal communication.  Edit: some dogs apparently
77595	0	a	More likely he's been trained to look at his owner, but he's really focusing on the thing he wants (the leash). My dogs do the same with treats I'm holding. They know they have to look me in the eyes before they get the treat, but they can't help looking at the food they want.  The aren't trying to point, but are simply splitting their attention between two things.

77612	0	a	> This is how Colt is trained to block my head during a seizure, because I have a TBI it is very dangerous for me to hit my head, I can literally die if I hit my head really bad again. This is only a reenactment, this is NOT a real seizure. And no of course I'm not really hitting my head in this video. This is just us keeping up with his training, I have to test him on everything that he knows often to make sure he still does it all reliably. He is trained to do this in a certain way that keeps both him and me safe, he will not get hurting doing this the way he has been trained to. I'm not actually there during a seizure so I would not be able to know if he did his job right or not. The middle video is basically a blooper, I laughed so hard, the floor was super slippery and he had a hard time getting his body under my 10lb head. The important thing that makes me super proud is that he never stops trying. He always looks back to make sure I am safe and keeps trying till I am. I am so blessed to have him. He has saved my life in many ways.   [Source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZskqSLnMDRQ&feature=youtu.be)

Clearing the area helps minimize the risk of the person hitting something while they are having a seizure, but in this case it seems that any impact to the head would be more detrimental because of a TBI.
77652	0	a	"You can touch someone who is having a seizure, especially if they are in immediate danger and need to be moved, but don't restrain them. You should clear the area as you mentioned, but also put something soft under their head like a towel or jacket to prevent head injuries. If you have training or feel comfortable doing so, you can check that their airway is clear (definitely don't put any objects in their mouth, and don't worry about them ""swallowing their tongue"" cause that's impossible). There's no stopping a seizure for the layman, so the goal is to protect the person from any further injury resulting from spasms."

77680	0	a	When I was in middle school I took place in FLL. Fll was a program to get kids involved in science,  one of the projects we did for competition was designing a purse for a girl who had epilepsy and a service dog. Due to the nature of her seizures she would just freeze and many people would not know something is wrong. The purse contained contacts on the bottom that the dog would press if he could tell something was wrong, making a sound asking people for help. The purse it's self was kinda shoddy as you can imange middle schoolers made it but it actuly worked very well with the dog.  
77681	0	a	Dogs can sense everything! I have a psychiatric service dog for ptsd and he can literally sense (via my changing pheromones and body language) when I'm having a panic attack and he will put pressure on my legs to help bring me back to the present, or he will bring me toys and force me to play so I can get out of my head, and if I cry he licks away my tears. Dogs are amazing. 
77682	0	a	Even untrained dogs can notice things. I'm diabetic and the last two dogs I've had, separated by about two years, could tell if my blood sugar was getting low.  That could also be because I tend to act drunk and insane when my blood sugar dips below 40, but they both would whine and whimper until I ate. 
77683	0	a	Just a question but is this not dangerous for the dog? From what I've read and heard the person experiencing the seizure can be very powerful and very dangerous to those around them. I heard it's best to move any obstacles around them so they don't hit anything and then back away. I've had a friend who almost broke his arm during an episode because he hit it so hard against a table leg.   Edit: wasn't trying to bring up dog vs. human danger levels, was just asking. Pretty cool that the dog is trained in a way as to not hurt themselves or the person experiencing the seizure. Another point against anti pit bull people!
77684	0	a	I'm diabetic too, my dog has woken me up from a serious low during the night and ran (opening two doors in the process) to get my mom. He had no training and very well could have saved my life that night.   Edit to add: nowadays he will lick me and cry/pant if I'm low or even if my blood sugar is high :) truly my bestest friend.

77698	0	a	Absolutely. My dog is untrained yet he's able to tell my dad when his blood sugar is dropping with barking. He might've associated the hormone levels changing with my dad beginning to feel dizzy and tired and sweaty. He's only done it when it was a major drop in blood sugar levels, but it did save my dads life. 
77699	0	a	Maybe? A lot more dangerous for the person having the seizure. Pit bulls are SOLID animals. Lots of muscle 
77700	0	a	>This is how Colt is trained to block my head during a seizure, because I have a TBI it is very dangerous for me to hit my head, I can literally die if I hit my head really bad again.   So it sounds like it's a case of human life > dangerous for the dog.  Most likely this is also a reason why a very sturdy breed of dog was used.  Pit-bulls are really good at staying calm and on task even when hurt if trained properly. 
77701	0	a	Since they can sense it some time before it happens, they do warn the owner. Possibly barking, heavy licking, acting restless, lying on their chest, etc. so the owner may have time to find a cushioned area.  I think it does also depend on the severity of epileptic episodes. I know some people hit their head on the ground very hard and hit things in general, others just have a foamy mouth and stare blankly for some time. So if an owner is prone to serious epileptic episodes, they may have an alarm button somewhere in the house or on them to call for help. Service dogs can be trained to hit those buttons. The purpose of the dog is to mainly help the person receive help as fast as possible. 
77702	0	a	Yes, that's the point. If the person has a seizure, instead of violently banging their skulls against a concrete floor, the dog elevates the head, which helps stop the convulsing neck since they don't have the angle of range and provides a buffer so they are hitting the dog, not the floor. Yes, there is a chance that a human or a dog could get hurt doing this, but probably not as bad as someone slamming their head uncontrollably against the ground.

77710	0	a	"My husband had cancer and it came back a total of 4 times. The second time we noticed his cat laying on really weird areas of his body and refusing to move. Like his hip, while he was laying on his side she would drape over him and purr. After a while we thought it was weird and when we went in for a PET scan and labs he told the doc where she was laying and we all laughed it off as his cancer hadn't been in that area.  Well the pet scan revealed new tumors and his hip bones deteriorating bc of the cancer in his hip bone. Laughed it off again. Till it happened three more times. By the third reoccurrence of her laying on specific areas we simply called the doc, told him about her doing ""it"" again and immediately came in for labs and biopsy. Thankfully it hasn't come back since but JFC it scared the hell out of me and every time she decides to lay on us now I kind of worry.  He had Hodgkin lymphoma stage 4. In bones organs soft tissues and tumors EVERYWHERE. Curable, but took some work. His only symptoms? Pain when drinking (turns out it was tumor sites) and blacking out when standing too fast. He did lose weight, but it took four different doctors to even bother TRYING to find the cancer. It ended up being a spine doctor who was going to do a steroid injection for pain who found it. After that we had to convince several doctors he had it. It was insane. Finally managed to get in with a cancer doctor who ran the right tests and did biposies. First chemo, then it came back, so chemo again, followed by a stem cell transplant. It came back again and they did localized radiation. One more time and they did the localized radiation again. It's been four years since and so far he's a survivor! "
77711	0	a	Their pain tolerance is also insanely high. I loved working with them in clinics because a vaccination or blood draw didn't bother them at all and they required much less restraint than dogs with lower pain thresholds. We would always restrain just in case, but none ever struggled for me. The Germans and Rottweilers I worked with were always the biggest babies though, along with almost all the small dogs, pugs being a pleasant exception.

77713	0	a	You're forgetting that for thousands of years humans killed every single puppy that was too aggressive, bit someone, or unresponsive to training. If we bred humans the same way, the shitty ones would die out.   Dogs are easy to train because we bred out the bad ones, not because dogs are mythical animals.  That said, I adore dogs and we are lucky to have them.

77736	0	a	The owner was probably rushing to help the duck get back to his feet. Leaving a duck on his back for an extended period of time in a home is not a great idea - those feathers are coated in oil that helps the duck stay warm and dry in cold water, but that oils comes off very easily.  Losing the oil isn't detrimental for the duck, since he can just produce more. But once that oil is on the bedsheets it's a hazard for the human. If the human gets too much of that oil on his skin, it won't come off easily since showering will be useless due to all of the duck oil. He'll struggle for months or even years to get that shining coat of duck oil off of him, as water beads up and rolls off harmlessly.   On top of that he'll slide off of chairs and he'll keep sinking out of his driver's seat in the car onto the floor because it's very slippery. Extended exposure will result in him growing feathers and just becoming a duck all together which is known as a 'Malady' (a term often used to describe any bad situation now, but its origins are here).

I don't have the answers, and that's the point, I need to piece things together that I recognize, until I can make heads or tails of what's going on. I'm not the problem, the problem is the problem, and it'll be pretty darn fun to solve it because puzzles are fun to solve.

77973	0	a	That's sad, I love my puppers. But I know somewhere, and maybe it's just me, those dogs don't give a damn if they live. They want to help, it's something ingrained in them. It's why we call them man's best friend.  This is just my opinion

77977	0	a	This is correct! A S&R dog needs to keep their paw feet protected from extreme heat, cold, and poky bits.
77978	0	a	That is heart wrenching. Goddamnit.... dogs are the best.
77979	0	a	Worked with military working dogs closely for 7 years. Only a tiny number do what this dog does. You're correct. They also do it with drugs and explosives on longer searches as well.   But it's worse for these dogs because dogs have a chemical bond with humans and they feel emotion even if it's not a human they know. Just like we do.   It's a shitty job even for a dog but without them people WILL die. At least handlers love their partners and try to take care of them as best they can  Sadly this one will probably develop respiratory issues and need to be put down 
77980	0	a	"After 9-11 my sons were taken to a local landfill and buried many many times so they could be found. A few guys I knew on the job needed fresh people cause the dogs were getting suspiscious of finding the same smelly person. The boys would ""wake up"" to nudges and immediately lavish attention on the dogs to signal a good hit. As far as the respiratory issues, I heard some company is close to a mask eye guard system for dogs but the materials smells have caused issues my pal is retired now so I have no idea if its been worked out or prototyped yet."
77981	0	a	"Let's just clarify here. 9/11 dogs did not suffer from depression ""because they only found bodies"". Some did suffer from a decreased drive to search because they were not being rewarded by having successful finds. During training sessions, search dogs have positive finds and are rewarded each time. Occasionally, they will participate in negative training searches where no one is hiding, and then they are not rewarded. But the huge majority of training involves a positive find and a bunch of fun playing with the ""victim"".  Some handlers did hide helpers in areas near the site, in order to give the dogs a chance to have positive finds. At no time did anyone hide in the actual rubble for this purpose. That would be highly insensitive and unprofessional.  In addition, the dogs were subjected to tremendous stress with significant travel to get to NYC, an often-chaotic environment, lack of quality sleep, different drinking water, and a completely different routine. This stress took a temporary toll on the health of some of the dogs on site, and that contributed to lack of drive in some."
77982	0	a	I've always wondered how many people work for knowyourmeme 
77983	0	a	I have not done S&R like this but I am a firefighter.  People would be surprised at the amount of sharp debris that gets thrown around during an incident.  They even teach us to sweep the straight stream (water sprayed from an attack line) across the floor after suppressing the flashover at the ceiling to push debris out of the way so we can make entry without ripping up our knees.  I imagine this is many magnitudes worse in a collapsed building scenario like they're experiencing in Mexico City.  The dogs probably can't perform without some sort of feet protection.
77984	0	a	Yes. We absolutely do not deserve them. But they don't care, all that matters to them is loving us and sometimes part of our sammiches.   Edit: geez guys, I meant that from the dogs are too sweet for this cruel cruel world. 😊
77985	0	a	Not an expert in soft landings, though. Eh?
77986	0	a	This is not what happened after 9/11. The dogs were getting plenty of finds ,and were rewarded for them. The problem was, after a while, all the remaining finds were corpses. The dogs became visibly despondent. Rescue workers had to hide in the rubble so the last find of every day would be a living person. 
77987	0	a	You deserve them, anyone that says that phrase usually deserves.   Unfortunately about 50% of the population are morons and don't even deserve a cockroach as a pet.  
77988	0	a	We absolutely do deserve them! Over tens of thousands of years we have ~~bread~~ bred them into amazing companions. Some people are jerks and don't but the majority of us are better off with them in our lives.

78087	0	a	Carrot is so sweet you should call her Carrot Cake.   It's hard having an older cat and watching their health decline. My family adopted a rescued barn kitten who we raised as an indoor/outdoor cat in Eastern Ontario. Her health problems started around 17 but she made it to 20 and passed this year. As tough as it is for outdoor kitties, I'm so comforted to know she never missed out on an adventure. Once they've spent a lot of time outside, it feels cruel to restrict them despite the elements and dangers. Carrot is living her best life and no matter where it ends, she's happy you gave her that. <3
78088	0	a	You have no idea how much this meant to my mom tonight. Carrot has had a rough couple of days and it has been really hard. You should of seen my mom’s face when I showed it to her, she was smiling from ear to ear and I think it made her feel a lot better. Thank you kind internet friend 😊

78112	0	a	We went to the barn to feed her yesterday and noticed she was walking on her paw funny. It was bending inwards at a weird angle and she was favouriting it but then sometimes she’d be walking on it fine. It’s not broken and she doesn’t seem to be in a lot of pain but there’s not much vets can do especially with a cat this old :( she’s also 90% blind and deaf and doesn’t eat as much as she should. She’s like a miracle cat honestly because we live in Alberta, Canada and our winters are fierce and she just keeps trucking on.

Not your intentionally obtuse rewriting of it.) rings very true.   My family actively undermined my creative passions in favor of forcing sports on me. You ever see 500 families get together to stage a cooperative art show or kid's concert the way they will a swim or gymnastics meet? No. Schools and other community organisations sometimes put them on, but families in America for the most don't art together unless they have exceptional access or resources, which is why most successful artists in this country have some connection to the entertainment industry at birth and why working class kids struggle to get a foothold in the arts.   Can't get a full ride drawing pictures, so how can it realistically elevate you out of poverty?   Hence, for most working class American parents with no arts education themselves (It's always first cut.) and no industry connections, it doesn't make any sense to raise a kid to play the guitar well, but makes perfect sense to push them toward a sport with scholarship prospects, whether they like that sport or not.  Maybe that's not your experience. Consider yourself lucky. That doesn't mean working class kids in the west aren't discouraged from arts participation everyday for a myriad of class and cultural reasons. They are. I'm sure the same thing happens to poor kids in Europe and Central and South America, too.  Western families absolutely need to to realign their values when it comes to arts appreciation and participation, but western cultures also need to find ways to elevate our working class artists to the same degree we do our athletes, only hopefully without all the exploitation.

78220	0	a	I was a batboy for the Pirates in spring training when Guillen played for them (late 90s) and it was constantly talked about how incredible his arm strength was.  First time I met him I handed him a baseball card to sign, but I didn't notice they put a picture of a different player on the card. His name, but a different player. Everyone in the clubhouse thought it was the funniest thing ever.   After they settled down, he asked to keep the card. I was kind of disappointed until he gave me his bat and signed it. I still have that bat.

78314	0	a	It’s always sad to lose when you train your whole life, but losing to the fastest person in the world must make it feel better. Like, there’s nothing you could’ve done better to shave a millisecond or two off. You see a world record, you strive to be that fast and you know at least 1 person was capable of going that fast. Then you try to get as close to it as possible, and someone next to you beats that number, and you were good enough to compete against them, and be there for the feat.

I’m sure things weren’t great for her when she got there but this is a representation of a story that was widely told and believed.

That’s why in French the sculpture is titled “L’Enlèvement de Proserpine” (enlèvement = abduction) and not “Le Viol de Proserpine” (viol = rape in the Brock Turner sense of the word)

Your right brain controls the left side of your body and your left brain controls the right side of your body. Typically, for right-handed people, they are more ""left brain"" dominated.  For ambidextrous people, each side has a shared dominancy.  But!  The same brain distribution is also found in left-handed people - and left-handed people share a lot of other traits with ambidextrous people.  It isn't all unicorns and rainbows.  Often times people who are ambidextrous or left-handed struggle more with math, and they are also more likely to have ADHD and schizophrenia.  Also - people with synethesia (merging senses, like seeing sound) are far, far more likely to be ambidextrous or left-handed."

78456	0	a	Nah, haven't you played fortnite or pubg? The chute clearly deploys itself
78457	0	a	Two things:  1 - Wide angle lenses give you a much better experience with these sorts of visuals. It's easier to keep things in frame, and provides a more complete picture (you don't necessarily need a full fisheye, but a standard lens will feel very...cramped, and miss a lot of the action if you turn your head slightly).  2 - GoPro's generally have an ultra-wide angle lens by default. Skydivers used to use other cameras, but GoPro has become the standard these days.

It only deploys if certain conditions are hit such as barometric pressure and terminal velocity at the 1k mark. It’s for cases when someone gets knocked out or go unconscious and can’t pull themselves.

It’s more difficult than having someone land on your shoulders during a routine, because those are expected moves in a specific way.

78535	0	a	"For anyone interested, this just happened a week ago. The rider is Pol Tarres, a young star riding a Husqvarna. He cross-trains trials bikes, hence his skills hopping over crazy obstacles with ease. He's a gold-class rider, meaning he's among the best.  This specific lap is part of the ""Prologue"" to the 2019 Red Bull Romaniacs hard enduro race. The prologue determines the starting order for the 4-day long race through the Romanian countryside.  The series is ""WESS"" (World Enduro Super Series) and includes the Erzberg Rodeo and a bunch of really cool races. Something I find fascinating is that young guys like Pol are competing with veterans like 45-year-old Graham Jarvis and watching the two's strategies play out across the 4-day span is super interesting.   FYI, Tarres didn't podium, but Jarvis did."

78627	0	a	Absolutely beautiful form and smooth execution.
78628	0	a	And here I am struggling to bring the shopping in
78629	0	a	That's Dr Madeleine Leander, aka [MaddeLisk](https://www.instagram.com/maddelisk_workout/). In addition to being a calisthenics beast, she has a PhD in Math and was the 2013 Starcraft 2 female world champion.
78630	0	a	Oh, so she's an attractive Swedish woman with a PhD in math and she's good at both fitness and Starcraft? Excuse me, I have another bagel to eat while I cry.
78631	0	a	I can only get so erect.
78632	0	a	Hooooooleeeeeeey fuck. What a god damn beast.  She’s been more successful in 3 careers than I have been in one. O.o All the respect.
78633	0	a	My peepee confused
78634	0	a	Wait til you hear about Jonny Kim. Dude was a Navy SEAL, then got a doctorate in medicine from Harvard, and now he's training with NASA to become an astronaut at age 35. Makes me feel like a complete failure in life.
78635	0	a	Mine’s not. I love a woman that can break me in half.
78636	0	a	And wit till you hear about Johnny Sins.  The man is s doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, a construction worker, a pizza delivery guy, and so much more.  It’s amazing how dedicated he is to bettering himself.  Makes me feel useless
78637	0	a	But what if she breaks your dick in half?
78638	0	a	Did he fucking stutter?
78639	0	a	No but *I* fucking shuttered.
78640	0	a	That's really impressive. Ninja class.
78641	0	a	I’m so impressed he didn’t get caught in any queues at the barriers or anyone getting aggy with him
78642	0	a	What’s the point of even having public transportation if you can get to the same place in the same amount of time on foot? SMH, such a waste of taxpayer money  Edit: based on a couple of the replies, I’d like to make it clear, I am being sarcastic. This is not a serious comment. You see that dude laying on the floor panting after making that run, during low traffic conditions? Obviously there’s a reason to have public transportation. Jesus, guys.

78648	0	a	I mean he coulda just taken the train to that same spot.
78649	0	a	Looks like he just ran around anything standing in his way
78650	0	a	We are all public transportation on this blessed day
78651	0	a	no room for error
78652	0	a	Also, your train will likely be delayed because train traffic ahead, so you might even get on the earlier train!
78653	0	a	Yeah after the stairs I would have collapsed of fatigue
78654	0	a	I’m surprised he didn’t realize this. Truly a case of brain vs. brawn
78655	0	a	I brake for nothing!
78656	0	a	~~He made a small error right near the end.... You can see from the train view that he ran past a door he needed and doubled back, but still made it work.~~ scrap that, I see what he was doing now.   If I saw this from the train I'd probably be laughing my ass of over the whole thing before congratulating him on doing something really cool.
78657	0	a	is this is some sort of time travel
78658	0	a	That was like 30 stairs..
78659	0	a	*I will run through you*
78660	0	a	I am all public transportation on this blessed day.
78661	0	a	He doesn’t make an error, he’s just coming down the stairs so fast he uses the wall in front of him to stop himself, then runs onto the platform. You can see from his POV shot there’s nowhere else to go at the bottom of the stairs.
78662	0	a	How the hell
78663	0	a	When you realized they picked Dwayne because they don’t need to draw his hair
78664	0	a	Step 1: take a video of you drawing Dwayne Johnson.  Step 2: make it into a time lapse.
78665	0	a	Now erase the extra lines and that's how you make a circle
78666	0	a	Paper beats Rock
78667	0	a	I think its a slowish wheel and they have a pre sketch so theyre doing lines based on pressure. Still hella impressive
78668	0	a	I think there's a textured picture underneath of it. have you ever put a quarter under a piece of paper and drew over it? I think that's what is going on here.
78669	0	a	I bet they would still find a way to draw hair

78697	0	a	Idk, I think it’s staged. What are the odds there would only be red balls left from a game and they form the shape of a 6? C’mon. Fishy.
78698	0	a	6 or backwards 👌?
78699	0	a	Same
78700	0	a	You cant really because the initial ball is slightly forward so when the next ball comes, it’s stopped by a slightly smaller junction of the opening that was left behind.   This is so it stops perfectly in place.
78701	0	a	Same

78781	0	a	best way to prevent being hunched over in old age is to work out (e.g. do squats).  The reason it happens is because your spine/bones shrink as you get older. If you have strong supporting muscles, the effect is mitigated somewhat.

78844	0	a	I can’t imagine knowing it would turn out l looking even a little bit like them-or like people at all.  It made me physically nervous when he first started and it was so janky-looking. Definitely top talent.
78845	0	a	Hey! Give the guy some credit, he is clearly blind and did this all without his sight.
78846	0	a	No but it is the one on his phone he looks at for reference. Could even be the last picture she had taken with him that she might not have a physical copy of, until the woodcarving that is. Especially moving since she can now trace/feel their faces if her eyesight degrades.

78857	0	a	This is a little off topic, but...  I just got back from a visit to Yiwu City in China. Lots of factories there, and tons of pollution. We visited the huge marketplace there which has literally 62,000 vendor booths. Sixty-two THOUSAND. Each of these is just a showroom for businesses (not end consumers) to buy goods in bulk. There are maybe five levels, and each level goes on for literally miles. It's absolutely insane.  Everything you can possibly think of is there, for sale. Party goods, bicycles, clothing, ceramics, office supplies, paintings, hunting supplies, yoga stuff, inflatable rafts...EVERYTHING.  This place supplies the world with stuff. Alibaba was built around this place.  All this shit will end up in a landfill. And manufacturing this stuff causes so much pollution.  This trip really gave me some perspective. Mass consumerism is kind of disgusting. THIS is surely helping to fuck up our planet.  EDIT: [Photos of this place](https://imgur.com/gallery/7MkQhoB)

That's still a huge accomplishment. And we shouldn't rely on celebrities and rich people to do all the fundraising/work. We all need to do whatever little things we can to help.

78863	0	a	Lots of comments about his personal pollution, which is unsurprising, but the reality is this isn’t an issue that can be solved at the individual level. Leo’s personal pollution doesn’t even make a minor dent, most of it comes from industrialization, mass production, and meat consumption.   The only thing that’s going to fix climate change is a aggressive investment in closing the last few gaps that separate renewables from fossil fuels in the market, namely efficiency and storage. Addressing these concerns ends the question of whether climate change is real or it matters, because it just doesn’t make economic sense to keep spending on fossil fuels even without a moral argument. We’re VERY close to solving some of these, in some cases renewables are already cheaper before government subsidy of oil. 100 million dollars goes a long way to solving these problems.

78866	0	a	Living in a place like Alberta Canada, I can tell you one of the reasons. Right now everyone believes our economy hinges on our oil and gas, so we have angry citizens begging for our jobs back while treadeu is pushing for going greener (which is good I should add). As an Albertan who wants to be responsible I'm starting to realize that unfortunately we're going to have to make sacrifices to save ALL OF OUR planet. I really don't know where our economy is going to be in a few years but I'd much rather have a planet to pass on to my kids. 
78867	0	a	Even worse China isn’t anywhere near as strict as the rest of the world, US included, when it comes to pollution management. China and India, two of the worlds biggest polluters, hardly follow any regulations to reduce their pollution. It doesn’t mater what the rest of the world is doing about it if China’s pollution is wrapping itself around the globe as we speak. Did you know pollution from China reached the coast of California in the US several years ago? It’s not slowing down.  It’s scary.

78874	0	a	Pollution management that isn’t marred by corruption is definitely very very important and as an Indian citizen I have seen personally that our government isn’t doing enough. Things are pretty bad in my country right now, especially in the cities.  On the other hand, I saw that you mentioned China and India as being “two of the world’s biggest polluters”. However, when it comes to things like CO2 emissions, [the US exceeds India in absolute numbers and consequently also exceeds it per capita by a pretty wide margin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions). The US itself has a long way to go in restricting its own carbon footprint.

78888	0	a	This is good. She messed up by committing insurance fraud, but her heart was in the right place. I feel like the punishment fits the crime. Honestly, it's the healthcare industry that forced her hand. If our system wasn't so screwed up she wouldn't need to risk breaking the law and the student could've gotten taken care of for free.

78894	0	a	What I don't understand is where was the student's relative? Did they just go away somewhere & leave him alone sick? Why does she have to buy him clothes & clean his house?  if he's a minor who isn't getting medical care & needs a school superintendent to buy his clothes, why isn't child services doing something? There's a whole story here we're not getting,
78895	0	a	I can’t believe this is the country people claim to be the “greatest country in the world” yet these are the hoops some people have to jump through to get health care. It seems that personal health really is a privilege.
78896	0	a	The people in the education field that actually care in the United States are the ones that get shit on and fired for things like this. If you are empathetic and caring you are most likely in fear of doing too much and being punished, possibly losing your job.

78910	0	a	"I didn't check the linked story, but since I got a first hand recounting of the story over lunch, I know.  He was living with his grandmother due to his parents being, let's say indisposed.  She first took him in for care but was denied as she was not his guardian.  Since she couldn't get a parent to help, she went this method.    This district is poor.  The teachers frequently will be giving kids things they ""forgot"" (ie dont have) like gloves and coats.  She is apparently an awesome person, recently appointed to this from being the principal of another school.    I was really worried when the story was first relayed to me, because stories about teachers and felonies rarely end well these days, but in this case I think the court showed appropriate leniency and humanity.

78913	0	a	As if insurance companies care about PR.
78914	0	a	They refused treatment because she was not his guardian. That part makes sense. Otherwise we'd have people taking children to medical centers to get the child well after fucking up to keep it hush hush.  But if the child went alone, they'd be taken in. Unfortunately, it also means a call to CPS.   It was a lose lose situation for the child. The superindendent did everything she could and beyond.

78925	0	a	This is likely one of the lowest allowed sentences for this. She did a great thing but it involved something illegal in the process. You can't just do illegal shit to help people.

78942	0	a	So, I'm a North Dakota resident and I wanted to give some context on this.  The state legislature voted this in for one purpose: They want North Dakota residents to stop pushing for full legalization. It keeps going on the ballot and they want it to stop. This decriminalization is supposed to be the state's version of a concession in the hope that it will slow the legalization push to a crawl.  The chair of the biggest legalization organization in the state has already publicly said he will not stop pushing or trying to get it on the ballot. Legalization has quite the minority support in the state because there is a large conservative constituency that is against it.  So while it may seem like this is pretty progressive for North Dakota, it only sort of is. The end goal is to head off full legalization in what has been a big fight between the semi-urban and Native tribal pockets of liberal voters in the state.
78943	0	a	North Dakota governor, whispering: Marijuana is now decriminalized.
78944	0	a	NORTH DAKOTA QUIETLY DECRIMINALIZED MARIJUANA. Not so quiet anymore huh?
78945	0	a	I mean North Dakota is not known to loudly do anything?
78946	0	a	*This is different from marijuana legalization. Under decriminalization, criminal penalties linked to marijuana are removed, but civil penalties, like a fine, remain in place and sales remain illegal.*  So not a crime to have it but still illegal to sell it.  One step at a time.

78955	0	a	This isn't why they decriminalized it. I'm a North Dakota resident. The goal of this was to try stifle a very loud legalization movement in the state. It's a concession to get them to stop putting it on the ballot every election. The chair of the organization pushing for legalization said it is not going to stop him.
78956	0	a	I mean, it's probably going to keep going on the ballot and it will continue to not pass. There are two things a lot of North Dakotan voters hate:  1. Liberal platforms  2. Change  Last year, a ballot measure passed to add language to the North Dakota Century Code that literally does not change the law.

78965	0	a	No, it was also state law here anyway.
78966	0	a	Because they pay: employment tax, income tax, sales tax, property tax, gasoline tax, and probably dozens more.  It wasn’t that long ago that Americans sort of took issue with being subjected to taxation without representation.
78967	0	a	> Why would non-citizens be allowed to vote?  You could be a legal non-citizen (like a permanent resident) who lives in a municipal area and pays taxes. Voting in the municipal election allows you a say in the community where you live and pay taxes.

78991	0	a	Followed by a change in health care plans.
78992	0	a	Ok. That's fair. But compare how many Mercedes or BMW you see on the roads with how many Porsche. Mercedes and BMW might get less profit per unit, but they sell a lot more. Not sure if the ratio is bigger than 3.5:1 but I'll look into it.  Edit: https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/company/porsche-deliveries-2016-sales-record-13310.html Porsche sold 237778 cars in 2016  http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Mercedes-Benz-climbs-to-the-top-of-the-premium-segment-in-20.xhtml?oid=15205636 2.083.888 is the number for Mercedes  So even if Mercedes has a lot more profit, Porsche gives bigger bonuses.

78997	0	a	It really grinds my gears when the good things a company does are dismissed as publicity stunts.   Yeah motherfucker, and you only donate to charity to alleviate the slight sadness from a commercial about starving children.   Publicity doesn't diminish the good act.
78998	0	a	That's the good thing about Germany, like the Netherlands and Finland, it has a compulsory two-tier board system for companies, where half of a supervisory board is elected by shareholders, while the other half is elected by people who represent employee interests. It then elects the management board, which leads the company, but always needs the approval of the supervisory board. Quite a good way to ensure that employees won't get screwed over, imo.           
78999	0	a	Kmart too, they hire some of the hardest working people I've met and treat them all like shit with patronising <5% discount cards, shitty bonuses that have to be spent in store, the list goes on.  EDIT: Aussie Kmart, TIL USA Kmart is dead or dying.

79006	0	a	I worked at Kmart for a day once. On my first night they had me fronting shelves for six hours straight. I was in charge of five isles and was told to report to the manager when I finished with every one. I finished and when I told the manager, she then walked me through each isles pointing out every single thing that was askew or not fronted. Thing is, people were shopping the whole time so when I would fix a shelf customers would take something right after.
79007	0	a	In Kmart's defense they just announced that they have substantial doubt they will even continue as a going concern. Sears will most likely cease to exist within the next five years.

79015	0	a	I don't think anybody would say it's a one for one type relationship. But I think you could make a case that terrible corporate culture has ruined Kmart. It Ruined Sears. And when the two merged they weren't any better off.   A symptom of terrible corporate culture is treating your employees badly.

Apparently corporate would not let them ban her so she carried on with this stuff for more than a year while I worked there until they started printing an extra copy of every one of her receipts so when she went to customer service and ""lost her receipt"" they'd say no problem, lets see which one it is lmao."

79032	0	a	We had the cheese guy. Nobody knew how he would do it but even with a camera on the cheese aisle permanently he used to steal $100+ of cheese a week. Those big cracker barrel bricks.

They sat him down in the back room while waiting for police and just let the ice cream melt in his pants.

79037	0	a	I think the guy means almost everyone probably realized the store was closed so didn't even bother to try and get into the store.  Like on Thanksgiving in the US, everyone knows which stores are closed and which ones are open. And even if they don't know a store is closed, if they pull into the parking lot and they are the only car in there, or they see all of the lights off and no one inside, they'll probably just turn around and leave. It's not like thieves go around to stores that are closed just checking to see if they are open on accident.

I’m not super informed on the subject but legalization seems to have generated a massive amount of tax money, drug overdoses have gone down and crime didn’t increase. Only thing I can think if lobbying from things like the pharmaceutical industries and others? I’m learning more about politics but not as informed as I should be.  Edit: thanks for all the replies, interesting stuff. I can’t reply to them all but I’m reading them!
79053	0	a	> In 1977, New York decriminalized possession of 25 grams or less of marijuana, to an infraction with a $100 fine.  This is just them pretending to do something so they can pander to special interests by stopping legalization efforts.
79054	0	a	I got pulled over a few years ago on 684 with less than a gram of marijuana, the cop didnt care about that.  But he arrested me for having a weed pen that was basically empty.  I guess it was classified schedule 7 - the same as possession as heroin.  Fucking. Bullshit.  It wasn't actually mine - it was my wife's, which was in her purse.  But i wasn't gonna let her get in trouble for that - she was applying to get her master's and I didn't want it to ruin her chances.  So I took the bullet.  After 6 months I went to court and after a year probation period it was put under seal.  Still had to spend thousands on a lawyer and had to go to a drug counselor for that whole period.  I also lived in CT at the time and had to travel to Brewster twice a week for the counseling - about an hour away.  And this is as someone who is a white male - POC get locked the fuck away.  The war on drugs is so fucking stupid.  Edit: don’t talk to the cops y’all  https://youtu.be/d-7o9xYp7eE

Possession of marijuana, in any amount, in a public place (a definition open to wide interpretation) is still a criminal misdemeanor in new York. The bill removes the ""in a public place"" part. Possession of up to an ounce for personal use will universally be a civil offense, not a criminal one, if this law is passed."

When they’re searched, they find weed on the person(or the person’s backpack, container, purse, etc. ). NYPD  takes the weed out, thus making it a misdemeanor of possession in public viewing.

Apparently he took the lump sum of 282 million and idk what the taxes are like but lets say he ends up with 170-200 million dollars. He could spend 150 million dollars on lavish stuff, and then still have 20-30 million left over that would make him enough on interest to survive a pretty luxurious lifestyle.

79145	0	a	He’ll live a good life in that almost all of his needs will be met, a bunch of people will be serving him to make his life easier, and he doesn’t have to work ever again or do anything he doesn’t want to.  But when it comes to the important factor of love and relationships, he will always wonder if people like him for him or for his money. He will have trouble finding a fulfilling relationship because the ones who are genuinely attracted to him for him will be lost in the sea of hot gold diggers and sugar babies. After getting burnt by these girls, each time he meets someone new who he’s really attracted to, he’ll always have a suspicion that they are just after the lifestyle that he can provide for them.  Soon he’ll be in his thirties and spiraling down into depression as he’s stuck in this limbo of dating and still playing the field, just because the turnover rate of girls is about one or two new ones per week. No long lasting meaningful relationship is ever formed. There probably were people who like him for him, but he mistakenly thought that she was another gold digger, or he pushed her away with his “gold digger tests”, or he didn’t find her as attractive as some of the models/gold diggers he slept with before.  And this is an ongoing problem with everything, because the money has made him jaded. Things that were acceptable once before like a small TV or small house aren’t adequate anymore. Everything will taste worse than the seven-course meals he ate at those three Michelin-starred restaurants. Every experience will feel lame compared to the crazy things he’s done when he traveled the world and splurged. Every car he drives will feel slow and cheap compared to his Lamborghini’s and Tesla’s. He has done it all already in his 20s. He has spoiled himself.  He wishes he could tell people about his depression. But nobody can relate. Some tell him that he has no right to complain because others are struggling to pay their bills. They all just tell him to appreciate what he has or to give his money to them. He makes a strong effort to do that, but it still doesn’t help his loneliness. And talking about it only backfires. Nobody has any sympathy for him, and it isolates him more from the world.  He sometimes wonders if the money is a curse. He constantly worries about people robbing him or stealing from him. He has frequent nightmares of people breaking into his house. So now he sleeps with an assault rifle and pistol next to his pillow. It didn’t help. The nightmares still haunt him. He just had one this morning and it woke him up. And now he’s on his phone, sitting in his bed, and typing some long reddit comment with no satisfying ending. Because that’s the curse of the hedonic treadmill; he will never be satisfied.

He took care of his immediate family, and proceeded to waste the rest of the money.  I truly hope this kid has a good head on his shoulders, and a good family behind him. History is against him, but I'll root for him to do some good as he says he wants to."

79156	0	a	It’s better to get it in a lump sum in general due to inflation and opportunity cost of using that money to invest, regardless of tax implications.
79157	0	a	Take the lump sum *if you know what to do with it*.  Big difference. 
79158	0	a	It basically amounts to whether or not you think you can get a better rate of return over x number of years compared to what the lottery pays. Most financial analysts will suggest you take the lump sum, because if you invest the lump sum in a basic S&P 500 index fund you are going to do better over 20 or 30 years than the lotto payout.
79159	0	a	This rule needs to be abolished in those states since the advancement if technology makes it so easy to find people nowadays.  I understand people want to know that a person actually won it instead of a lottery official scamming someone but I'm sure something could be thought of to verify the lottery wasn't rigged.

79174	0	a	Typically, the lottery actually invests the funds and pays out at a rate equal to or greater than inflation as time goes on when doing yearly payments. Opportunity cost is debatable. Though he may now have the opportunity to buy into something for $200M, that might not be worth as much as being able to buy into something for $10M 20 years from now. Having a yearly income is a great way to ensure that you're not flat broke in five years, like almost all lotto winners are.  
79175	0	a	Yeah this is one of the first thing they teach you in economics classes.  You can invest the lump sum and get dividends which ultimately can get you more money than even the long term payout.

79200	0	a	There are ways around that. Like claiming the winnings through a trust or LLC. That's why step one is ALWAYS tell nobody and get a lawyer.   Winning the lottery is a lot like getting pulled over: keep your mouth shut and lawyer up.
79201	0	a	I would wait to claim it, grow my hair and a big beard then claim it in another state. After the photos I'd immediately shave my head and beard, change my name, split it into $20m chunks and put them in different investments that are inaccessible to me for a variety of times. Some within a year, some 3 or 5 then one in 10 years, one 15, etc. THEN, sure I'd come home and pay off my parents mortgage, buy Rolexes for my friends with the understanding it's a 1 time gift and that drinks or whatever will always be on me and that if they ever ask again it will be probably be the last time they speak to me.  As exciting as it would be to try to turn it into a billion dollars or help save the world I figure at least this way if you screw up you get some do-overs. 
79202	0	a	Iirc lotto wins are required to go public to claim the money in part to help demonstrate to others the lotto is not a scam. I could be wrong though...or it may depend on the state.   Edit: lotto not loot, though I guess that kinda worked.

He ended up settling out of court (paying these people off!) rather than go through court, even though it was a BS claim.  Shane is about to wish he was never a millionaire.

Others have pointed this out, but itd be impractical to have her read every book. I was being over the top. But a good little series of quests involving bringing her a few books that she reads to you...I think thatd be absolutely wonderful.  I'm a nearly 40 year old guy and I'd sit in this game (preferably in VR) and enjoy storytime with grandma and probably break down and cry.

79236	0	a	I've been waiting for this tech to come to gaming so that I could use it for role playing purposes but eventually we'll reach a point where you read like a 1-page document specifically designed to pick up how you pronounce sounds so that the game can synthesize your voice and use it for all the MC voice lines.  The same can be done for an NPC like this, theoretically. Obviously, a real voice actor would be best because they can fuse emotion into their lines but for something like reading every book in Tamriel, I'd be more than happy with this.

And when I say super wealthy I’m talking about billionaires. I don’t think most people truly understand how big of a number 1 billion is. A middle class lifestyle for everyone could be the norm if the super wealthy worked together and all pitched in a bit. This is why everyone’s mad about billionaires donating to fix Notre Dame.

79266	0	a	I remember seeing something on TV once about a company who essentially did away with middle management, and where they would usually have 8 very well paid managers and several dozen poorly paid workers, they had 2 managers and used the money saved to increase the workers’ wages instead. The workers all knew their jobs and began self-managing and managing each other and because they felt their wage was more than fair they worked enthusiastically and were reliable. The odd one or two who would be lazy were quickly singled out by the two managers remaining because they stood out amongst their hard working peers.  In places where you have, say, 10 sales people and 4 managers, if you’re short staffed by 2 employees you’d expect two managers to step in and basically fill their roles for the day but often they have absolutely no interest in doing that, and instead crack the whip even harder over the remaining 8 staff.  Any boss who rolls up his sleeves and works with his employees will have endless respect for it; it’s the ones who hide in their office that piss everyone off!

79273	0	a	I just had my first real taste in management. About 20 people, I get to run the project my way and at the end of it we delivered a superior product only a week over schedule.  Anyway, I walked in expecting to be not like a real boss but like a 'cool boss'. And it was cool. Everything was moving steady as we got set up and organized the first couple weeks. Identified a problem child right away but was able to mitigate her dead weight in productive ways.   Then the honeymoon period ended abruptly, somewhere near returning from lunch on like a stupid day like a Friday, and my problem child went ballistic on a new hire on his first day.  When we spoke about it her rebuttal devolved into a half-racist rant and why she shouldn't have to hold their hand on unfamiliar tasks.   So then I'm the bad guy because despite giving my new team the loosest possible amount of leash, one person created a situation that had to go on paper and as a result I immediately had to drop being cool and become the policy enforcer.   The point of the word vomit is my biggest lesson is I tried to be cool but habits of individuals and the pressure of the bureaucracy have this disgusting way of distorting even the most idealist minded manager.
79274	0	a	- Support your team on the regular. Cover a shift. Pick work off someone else’s plate when you know they’re getting behind.  - Be open to trying new ideas or making changes. “This is how we’ve always done it” and “we can talk about it another time” are not appropriate responses. They’re ways of saying “No.”  - focus on outcomes, not input. If Bob is 15 mins late every day but gets everything done and nothing was negatively affected, then let it go. If it’s causing an issue, the response shouldn’t be “you were supposed to be here at 8am!”  Instead it should focus on the outcome: “we were all waiting to start the meeting until you got there.”      Edit: [Some of y’all getting real salty about Bob...](https://media.giphy.com/media/KFzibPznpsR69ShEuH/giphy.gif)
79275	0	a	I've had so many amazing managers. I just feel bad they have no upward mobility and their only reward except for bland praise during staff meetings is that they aren't allowed any time off without absolute mutiny occurring while they were away.
79276	0	a	Yep, if you pay people shit then you should totally expect a shitty work from them. It's the #1 reason some supervisors go nuts over having to constantly be behind workers to micromanage them. Because people aren't going to give a fuck about their job if you pay them minimum or near minimum wage. Can't blame the workers here, you get what you pay for.  **Edit:** I'd add that I live in China where I see this everyday, workers give absolutely zero fucks about their job because the minimum salary here is so low in comparison to how expensive stuff has become in the last few years, China isn't nearly as cheap as it used to be, it's probably even more pronounced here than back in the US  I have a trade office here and I pay my staff way above what the local market says they deserve, I also pay excessively generous commissions for my sales team, the results are striking. I get motivated people who are really involved with the company, who will go far and beyond to meet their targets and generally optimistic mood and faces.  Of course my company is small and even extremely small compared to Disney, but I don't see why it wouldn't bear the same results for large corporations.

79293	0	a	It is and it isn’t uplifting in that the middle class continues to be squeezed from both ends. In that laws and acts of goodwill help poorer families, while affluent families can simply pay tuition. What about the middle class? This current system is a recipe for further income disparity.    Or is it just churn of two segments of the population: the group of low income folks who can take advantage of provisions like this and switching places with a group of middle class people who cant who sink into lower income. Net zero.

79295	0	a	If your family makes under 60k at some elite schools, (Princeton, Stanford, Duke, and a few others), you don't pay room & board either.  If your family makes under 100-120k, you still don't pay tuition.

79297	0	a	So those who make $60K are shit out of luck because they make too much money? That's why things like this aren't fair. The difference between making $56K and $60K is not enough to cover college tuition. So the person making $60K is going to be with around $40K because they have to pay for their college, while the person making $56K gets a free ride and still has $56K?

79313	0	a	> turn down jobs because they would lose welfare benefits.  This is called a benefits cliff and I'm currently trying to climb myself (and my family) out of one at the moment... it sucks. I recently got a job that resulted in a $8k annual raise, however my net usable income is significantly lower now because of a number of factors, one of which is the loss of benefits.  First we lost housing assistance completely. This was the biggest loss of usable income. This program had helped us immensely. My wife and I lost medical but our children are still covered (my employer offers medical but we pay a bit out of pocket out of it and there are larger co-pays). We lost energy assistance.  On top of that I am required to contribute to retirement, which seems good because my employer contributes 2 times my contribution up to a point, but I won't get access to that contribution unless I stay here for three years and at this pay that simply is not possible.  I roughly calculated that while I'm getting paid an extra ~$600 per month gross income, I'm actually netting $500 less now.  This essentially means that I'm netting $6,000 less per year because I got a job that pays $8,000 more... it's getting hard to meet basic necessities suddenly when before we were actually able to save from month to month.  All of this adds a lot of stress to my daily life. I spend a significant amount of time budgeting and worrying about money. I just had unexpected expenses for my wife's car that needed to be covered. Fortunately we have some in savings but right now I can't see how we could possibly replace that money spent because we just don't have any extra cash. I fear that all of this is impacting my health as I've started experiencing anxiety attacks and it's impacted my overall mood.  It's an awful place to be.  I'm resolved to climb out of this gorge, but right now it really sucks. I love my current job, I love doing research and working on projects that benefit the environment and humans alike, but I simply don't get paid enough and I'm looking for work elsewhere because we simply can't afford to keep living like this.

79326	0	a	Benefits cliffs can be fairly large. [Using the Guardian's (clearly such a conservative source) example](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jul/20/benefits-cliff-minimum-wage-increase-backfire-poverty), going from $15 an hour to $15.50 an hour loses $9000 in childcare benefits.  To overcome that loss of $9000, the worker would have to get a raise to $19.50. This is without accounting for the tax rate. So you're looking at a 33% raise there to make up for lost benefits.

I live off campus so my living expenses are lower, ~$7000/year. My total cost of attendance is going to be ~$15,000 for the year if you include the living expenses.  My little brother will be a freshman next year, so he's required to live on campus in the dorms by rule. That means he's required to have a meal plan. His room and board are going to cost him ~$12K, plus the tuition. So he's looking at ~$20,000 paid directly to the university for his freshman year as an in-state student.

There are of course special circumstances but they're few and far between.   If I consistently work longer, people assume that you're not prioritising correctly, or are just poor at your job. In the UK (and no doubt other places) its worn like a badge of honour.

But since my boss didn't see me working, I must not have done anything. Even if I provide a list of things that were done, I still get weird looks and treated like I've taken a day off.  Being able to work remote is also great when you're sick, because you don't lose pay or have to use vacation/sick time and also don't get anyone in the office sick.   There is a large segment of managers/executives/owners in this country who cannot wrap their heads around change of any kind and these are the same exact people who can't believe anyone is working unless they're sitting in the office.

79399	0	a	As a Chilean living in Chile, I can say that the Tompkins moving here was one of the best things that could happen to my country. I have mad respect for them and their work.
79400	0	a	"Chilean here - my 2 cents on the subject, if they are of any use to someone.  1. I am *very* grateful of the fact that someone like D.T. took interest in doing this. By spending a substantial amount of his fortune, he probably shaped how my country will look in the future—think about it: my great grand children (and more) will probably get to enjoy the beautiful landscapes I've had the pleasure to enjoy myself.  2. When he first moved to Chile and started buying considerable stretches of land, the authorities pushed back with several would-be-frictions, which luckily were completely unconstitutional—so ""can't stop me"". Dick move on our side, sorry about that.  3. After he died his wife made *the* ballsiest move—it probably was something ongoing, though—and gave away these huge stretches of land, which *no* government could refuse to take and jump into this protective project without looking stupid. She forced us to commit with the preservation of our lands for future generations. Hats off to the Tompkins.  This is an incredible investment that will most definitely pay off. Not now, not in 10 years, but maybe in 20 or 30. I think I speak for most of us Chileans when I say: thank you."

79406	0	a	"Patagonia is maybe my favorite company on the planet. They are doing so many things right. 90% of their textiles are recycled or Bluesign approved and they are literally inventing new manufacturing methods to minimize their own environmental impact, while still donating a portion of their revenue every year to grassroots environmental organizations. Last year they donated 100% of their Black Friday sales to small grassroots environmental groups around the country, even though they had 5 times more revenue than they had anticipated.  They are providing people with living wage jobs, providing consumers with sustainable, responsible goods that are made to last, and donating literally millions of dollars to environmental protection every year.  They will repair or replace ANYTHING with their logo on it for free. I bought my girlfriend a really nice down vest for Christmas last year; it got ripped badly during a long hike, and they had it completely repaired and back to us within 3 weeks.  They also recently started a program called [worn wear](https://wornwear.patagonia.com/) to get rid of unsold merchandise, and re-sell gear that people returned under their ""100% satisfaction guarantee"". They basically wash everything and sell it for 80% off. I paid $39 for a ~$200 down jacket that someone returned, and it came with a mint in the pocket. lol  They truly care about preserving the planet, and they really put their money where their mouth is."

79410	0	a	Doug Tompkins (NorhFace  founder who gifted the land) spent some years looking at the factories and mills making the clothing line Esprit, he formed with his wife in the 70's or 80's and he felt such guilt (over the incredible pollution mills and factories cause) because he was already an avid outdoors person. He dedicated his life to help undo and prevent more damage.  He'd always been into hiking and mountain climbing and redesigned I think invested some gear out of necessity and it became a company. I think the dome shape tents came from him? 
79411	0	a	Douglas tompkins was a cool guy. I'm Chilean an he appeared a lot in the news, defending the south, he was very vocal against the energy plant projects. Poor dude died of hypothermia while kayaking.

79414	0	a	I bought my son a North Face backpack in 5th grade for about $100. He used the same backpack until he graduated high school. It is still in good enough shape to use and was only replaced because it didn't fit in laptop real well. That was the best priced backpack I could have purchased.

79424	0	a	EVERYONE involved is beyond brave. To think that experienced divers said this was treacherous. Hell, even a Thai SEAL died on the same route. These boys were weak and malnourished and didn't know how to swim a week ago.   The boys have one diver in front guiding them and holding their tank and one diver behind. Through pitch dark passages with as little as 15 inches of space. The biggest fear was that these kids would panic and drown not only themselves but possibly their diver. Huge props to everyone involved. It's been amazing to see everyone from across the world come together. 
79425	0	a	I still can’t believe they managed to find them.   Imagine being lost in some massive cave system, waiting and waiting for days not knowing anyone was looking for you and then all of a sudden a diver pops up 
79426	0	a	This is awesome. Weren't they saying like 2 days ago it was going to take forever just to get one out? Saying it was like a 5km cave dive? 
79427	0	a	The world is rooting for you!
79428	0	a	Anyone know how they are being rescued please? Did they teach them to dive? if yes, then what they have done is very impressive and I hope all of them get out safely.

79434	0	a	I can’t wait to read ALL are rescued! 
79435	0	a	Damn the mark Wahlberg or Dwayne Johnson movie about this next year is gnna be intense. In all seriousness tho  good to see their safe. Crazy story 
79436	0	a	>The death Friday of a former Thai navy SEAL underscored the risks. The diver, the first fatality of the rescue effort, was working in a volunteer capacity and died on a mission to place air canisters along the passage to where the boys are, necessary for divers to safely travel the five- to six-hour route.  Geez, 5-6 hour underwater dive through small passageways. How did the first person make it through? Was it a known route?
79437	0	a	Imagine how crazy it must have been for the first diver to find the kids. No signs of life, cave totally flooded, 99% chance you're just finding bodies. Squeezing through tiny holes, swimming for literally hours... And then from the kids perspective, you're trapped in the cave not knowing if anyone even knows where you are let alone if they'll ever find you, wondering if you'll die of hunger/thirst or if a flood will drown you in there first... The moment when the diver and the kids saw each other for the first time must have been insane. 
79438	0	a	I really hope at least one Navy SEAL is wearing a GoPro or something so we can someday see their route from their view.   Update: Thanks to those that pointed out that there wouldn't be good lighting in the cave.  I did read about that days ago that even a good flashlight wouldn't help much.  I completely forgot so thanks for the reminder.
79439	0	a	So far a very well executed rescue mission. Hopefully they can get the last 5 out safely when they resume operations tomorrow.
79440	0	a	Still waiting to hear everyone gets rescued. But these boys are going to have a tight bond for the rest of their lives like no other.
79441	0	a	What is this? Good news? That doesn't happen.      Finally, out of this shit storm this current world is facing there's something good that comes out of it.
79442	0	a	'Good news! we save 14th of them!'  '14? But there is around 13 of them! Who is the 14th??'  *Cue thai horror music*
79443	0	a	When all is said and done, I would really like insight into how they prepped these boys mentally. I find the psychological aspect of the rescue fascinating. Is there a Paul Holes of cave diving?
79444	0	a	I don't know anything about diving.  How can they drown a diver if they have oxygen mask on ?
79445	0	a	that video of them discovering them for the first time was insane. so the diver was putting up guidelines (literally) for other divers from the route, ran out of line and went up to the surface when he spotted them. The ''How many of you? Thirteen? Brilliant!'' is such an iconic quote already. Like he's super happy that it's all 13 of them right there, even with how fucked up the situation is  edit: the facebook link to the video on the thai navy seal facebook page  [https://www.facebook.com/ThaiSEAL/videos/1631228493667210/](https://www.facebook.com/ThaiSEAL/videos/1631228493667210/) 
79446	0	a	No kidding! And further more, it is pitch dark, so you might hear the water sounds as the diver surfaces... maybe it's a rescuer... or maybe one of your mates fell off the ledge. And, then, you see the first light you have seen in days. Incredible. 
79447	0	a	Because they've been working around the clock to drain as much water as possible from the cave, dramatically reducing the amount of diving required, and they've found a way to lead inexperienced boys through the cave without actually training them to dive.  Basically a lot of experts working extremely hard to make the impossible possible. 
79448	0	a	They pumped a shit ton of the water out and thankfully it hasn't rained again. 
79449	0	a	Under promise, over deliver. Lower expectations so that when shit goes south, nobody's blaming anyone for making promises they couldn't keep.
79450	0	a	Fuck yeah humanity! We can do amazing things when we want to. All these people working so hard to make the imposible happen. 
79451	0	a	I heard they could mostly walk except this one small section. They pumped A LOT of water out of the caves 
79452	0	a	Somewhat to dive, but not as much as to not panic, which is arguably more impressive for the timespan.

79458	0	a	Less of it is flooded now than it was before (around the time the boys were discovered). The topography of the cave was somewhat known. The first person to find them was one of the world's greatest cave divers who was called in to help. He was putting in a line for other divers to follow & he surfaced next to the ledge where the boys were.  Here's [an article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/03/meet-the-british-a-team-divers-at-the-center-of-thailand-cave-rescue/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c88f234897f4) about the two top UK divers who were called in to help. They are civilians and they are volunteers.
79459	0	a	You won’t see much. It’s muddy, dark, water. 
79460	0	a	Personally hope that the development of that thing will be helpful for future rescue situations. 
79461	0	a	Something changed. They were able to pump enough water out of the caves to significantly reduce how much diving the boys have to do. This makes the trip go faster and reduces the risk. The less time they spend underwater the better.  Additionally, the heavy rains on Sunday haven't raised the level of water in the cave like people expected them to. 
79462	0	a	Two of the world's top cave divers found them. I believe they are British. 
79463	0	a	The world's best cave divers came in (Rick Stanton & John Volanten) from the UK. They have done other risky cave diving rescue (& recovery) missions.  The boys' bikes were at the mouth of the cave. As rescuers entered the cave, they found hand prints and later found the boys' gear (shoes, back packs) which confirmed they were in the cave and which direction they went at a fork in the cave.  The topography of the cave has been roughly mapped before. They rescuers knew the rain flooded the lower parts of the cave and knew generally where the higher ground was - so they pressed into the cave hoping the boys were sheltering on higher ground. And, they were!  ETA: Here's [an article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/03/meet-the-british-a-team-divers-at-the-center-of-thailand-cave-rescue/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c88f234897f4) about the expert divers.

79465	0	a	It's a cave people walk through all the time. They got flash flooded outside of season and the water never went away, they had to keep going deeper to get out of it.

79469	0	a	That's actually helpful, swimming through a two-banana gap sounds way more intense than a 15in gap. 
79470	0	a	I feel like being stuck in a cave for 10+ days probably already prepared them.
79471	0	a	That's something I was amazed by as well. It must be so difficult to get easily excitable 11 year olds to swim through 15in passages in zero visibility without panicking. 
79472	0	a	Yes sadly.
79473	0	a	Panic, Rip off their mask, flail and pull out a tube of someone else.
79474	0	a	You can carry only limited amounts of oxygen in tanks. If a diver gets disoriented enough and loses the guide line, it is conceivable that they could get lost in there until the oxygen runs out.   If a diver panics, they could try to rip their mask off or knock someone else’s off (although one of the most basic things a diver learns is how to retrieve their regulator (the breathing apparatus) if it gets knocked out of their mouth).   Also, the rocks are hard, possibly jagged, and with poor visibility, it is possible to ram into something hard enough to get injured. The likelihood increases with decreasing visibility (more flood water, struggling resulting in more silt and mud being kicked up), faster currents, and a panicking passenger who could be flailing about desperately.   And finally, there are all sorts of lines floating around—the guide line, air hoses to the regulators, and various tethers. Getting disoriented and spinning around could result in getting tangled up in the various lines, which could prevent breathing or prevent them from exiting the submerged area. And with such poor visibility, you couldn’t even begin to untangle yourself. 
79475	0	a	The RELIEF that all of them are relatively safe and together, that they’re all alive, that they’re moving and speaking just... such relief.    ETA: the boys seem dazedly surprised that people from the UK are there. They’re in for a shock when they find out the world came out to help them
79476	0	a	"Jeez. 10 Days in that place and then some guys just pop up out of the depths. Unbelievable. The diver who said, ""You are strong! You are very strong!"" just made me lose it."

79494	0	a	Diazepam may have been a contributing factor. 
79495	0	a	Yeah, I think read that they are using very small doses of anxiety meds for them not to panic and before even going making them comfortable with the oxygen masks and the water.
79496	0	a	They were probably like, “wait, how fucking far does this cave go?!”
79497	0	a	I’ve been feeling very...meh about the world lately. The headlines are always full of all kinds of horrible stuff. I’m not happy that those poor people were trapped in that cave, but I’m so glad to see how so many people from around the world have pitched in to help. Restores a little faith in humanity, yeah shitty stuff will still happen but there are plenty of good people in the world who will risk their lives to help others. 
79498	0	a	One of the neater experiences I had (it's not that neat--I don't get out much) was snorkeling in cenotes and seeing cave divers below me. You see a light down below and then watch all these people swim into view below you. It's kind of beautiful and surreal.
79499	0	a	There will be a movie no doubt. 
79500	0	a	It really is great how much effort they are putting into this. But take a step back and think about it at a larger scale and you get a strange perspective. Like they're probably spending so much money on saving these 13 boys, meanwhile 13 boys have probably died from lack of adequate healthcare or housing.   (This isn't specifically related to Thailand, I know nothing about their politics, I just mean this as a general point.)

79509	0	a	>“Small section” is still the length of 20 Olympic size swimming pools  No it wasn't that long - that would be an entire kilometer. The worst section was 400m at full water height (and it's come down considerably), which would be 8 swimming pools. 
79510	0	a	Their coach was also a monk, and has already taught them to meditate so hopefully that helped lot during this.

79520	0	a	Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the coach had some food and water he rationed out at the start. Now your body can go about 3 weeks without food so after running out they would've just gotten hungry. Now the part I'm not sure on is how much water they had since you can only go about 3 days without it. My guess which is just speculation is they would have had to drink cave water. All the possible diseases you could get from that are a terrible thought although given the choice of that or death by dehydration it seems logical to me that they must have to survive 10 days. Or the coach had enough water to keep them all alive that long but that's unlikely for a trip that wasn't planned to be overnight.
79521	0	a	And theres no way it won't be incredible. Reality has already written it like a movie script.

79562	0	a	Exactly! When I first heard the news I was so sad and confused as to why the coach would take such a risk. However, just like you said, I read more and more and saw that the coach had good intentions. I read an article yesterday that said the parents supposedly wrote letters to the team and the coach and told the coach that they would never blame him for this. I’m sure he’s incredibly angry with himself, but he’s the only reason those boys are alive right now. I hope the media isn’t too hard on him, he sounds like a fantastic guy in an unthinkable situation.

79577	0	a	Something jarred in me when I saw this come up under ‘Uplifting News’. Peter Wang could have gone to Military Academy, but now he never will. He died wearing his Junior ROTC shirt, died doing what he believed was right, because he saw beyond himself. Peter Wang dreamed, and realised things about the fragility and precious nature of life that so few ever see. And now by the merit of that same fragility he is gone and his dreams are gone. I have the upmost respect for the US Military Academy for the way they treated the situation: by them, no greater honour could have been given to Peter. I hope they are proud of their son, for the incredible and selfless action he took, but no amount of pride, and no medal any army can award, can bring their son back. He will never see that medal, never go to the training academy, never again fight for what he believes in. Peter Wang knew a bravery few of us ever see, a bravery I dearly hope neither you nor I will ever have to know or see, so please let’s celebrate that but let’s also not forget the horror of what just has happened, because let me assure you neither his parents nor the friends he saved ever will. I’m not here to talk to you about gun laws or terrorism, or tell you what to do or ask you to sign something. I’m just here to beg that as a society we never forget what has happened here, because both Peter’s bravery and Peter’s tragedy need to be remembered. I beg that we do not let this happen again, as a boy just older than Peter who sees in the smile on the picture on his memorial everything I could ever want in a friend; everything a parent could ever ask for in a child and everything we could ask for in a young man. Honour Peter, and let the gratitude for what he did stay with us forever, but please never let any fifteen year old boy make that sacrifice again.

79594	0	a	Every time I hear about this story I tear up more than a little. Peter Wang was certainly a hero, but all I can imagine is what his parents are going through right now.   They immigrated from China, and I can only imagine their reason for immigrating was to have a better life for their family. This is the dream that almost everyone who chooses to leave their home for a new country has, so I would guess this family is no exception.   Since I’ve heard no mention of Peter Wang having any siblings, I imagine also that he is an only child. (Since he was born in China during the one child policy, I think this is a fair assumption.) So then he was not only an only child, but the oldest and only son - a hugely important role in Chinese culture. Who is going to take care of his parents when they grow old?   This all happened on the eve of Chinese New Year, which is the biggest holiday of the year for Chinese people. Imagine if this whole incident had happened on Christmas Eve, what an extra agony this would have been for the rest of the parents. Losing a child is horrific no matter what time of year it happens, but having it right before a major celebration just adds an extra layer of tragedy.   This kid is rightfully being celebrated as a hero,  but I don’t know how much consolation that is for his parents who had so many hopes and dreams for him.  These parents chose to leave behind their home and country so that their son could have a brighter future with more opportunities.   And it turns out that the only opportunity America brought him is the opportunity to die for his country.

79614	0	a	"I just went through Active Shooter training at the hospital I work at and they explained that this is actually the wrong thing to do. Teachers have learned through years of tornado drills that students should be kept under their desks, quiet, and to wait for instructions. This is why 12 out of the students killed in Columbine were killed in the library. The librarian told them to quietly hide under their desks where they were promptly executed. It's not her fault, she was only doing what she knew in a desperate situation.   Unfortunately, 90% of the students in the first room at the Virginia Tech massacre were killed because they attempted to hide under their desks when the murderer started shooting. The following rooms attempted to deny entry of the killer by barricading the door. The subsequent rooms he shot had less casualties as people attempted to deny entry. Even with failed denial, the death rates were lower in the rooms that people tried to deny or defend. The last room had no casualties because the students laid on the floor foot to shoulder and blocked the door. The killer fired through the door but didn't shoot low enough, and couldn't open the braced door. There were no injuries or casualties in that room.   1. **Avoid** the shooter. Run. Scream. Windows, doors, exits. A 15 foot drop and a broken leg is better than sitting under your desk waiting for your turn to be executed by a coward.  2. If you cannot avoid the shooter, **DENY** the shooter access. Barricade doors with chairs, desks, other heavy objects. Whatever is near. Make it difficult for the shooter to reach you. Remember, police response time has been on average 3 minutes from the initial call. The vast majority of active shooter events have taken place in 3 minutes or less. If you can prolong the time it takes for the shooter to reach you or other victims, you are a hero simply by hiding.  3. If you cannot avoid the shooter and you absolutely cannot deny, then **DEFEND** yourself against the shooter. Position yourself advantageously against the shooter if you hear the direction they are coming from. Prepare to attack from the sides or behind. The weapon is your target. If you cannot avoid or deny, do not allow that shooter to take your precious life with that gun. They have no right to take your life. Get angry. Close the distance to the shooter as quickly as possible. Incite groups of potential victims i.e. ""He's going to kill us! Get him!"" to attack the shooter and quickly grab control of the slide of the gun (if a handgun) if the slide cannot reset, the weapon cannot be fired again. Without a gun, the shooter is worthless. The power is the gun, not the shooter. Get the gun, get the power. Keep in mind, this is your last resort. Only defend if you cannot escape or deny the shooter access to you.  http://www.avoiddenydefend.org/"

NRA used to advocate both sides of gun legistlature, and their mission was to equip and train people so another civil war will not drag on as the civil war did. Their logic was poor training was what led to the length and death toll.  But... that was over 150 years ago.  What they've become is a cult devoted to guns, near as I can tell.  It's spooky honestly.

For water pollution, that number increases to 393 times  Washington state had a study on the effects of banning plastic bags and switching to reusable. After the study they found that switching to reusable was much much more destructive so they stopped their initial initiative to ban plastic bags state wide.   IIRC, the information from their study found that the people pushing reusable bags were the grocery chains themselves because of how much extra profit they gain from selling them. It was quite a disgusting find and instead of doing anything about it they just concluded that there’s no need to ban plastics.

(Correction: Kroger has been acquiring other regional chains without renaming and apparently is quite large now.  I don't believe any of the competing chains are close in size)  I'm almost positive that Walmart has a significantly higher market share in the grocery business than Kroger, but I guess might be excluded as it is not just a 'supermarket chain'

The 5p bag charge in the UK (5p per each single use carrier bag) dropped our bag usage from 7.5 billion in 2015 to 0.5 billion in 2016, probably less still since.

That's great that he recognizes that, and sees these people as those he feels he should educate on reality!  >Daryl said: 'I was very well prepared for the meeting in terms of knowledge of my topic. I have just about every book written on the Klan and I've read them all.  That doesn't sound like an easy task, even if the books were not written by prominent racists. It's awesome that he prepared himself so well, and was able to sway so many of those people.  This man's actions are extremely amazing, not just for what he did but how he sees the world and music itself!

79678	0	a	I grew up in a white neighborhood.  We had a black family that moved in down the street when I was seven. My cousins would come over a say racist shit about them.  One day we saw one of the black kids playing and my cousin told me to go call him the N word. I was a young and impressionable kid so I said I would. I rode my bike down the street to do the task. When I rode up to him on my bike we made eye contact he smiled and said nice bike. I said thank you and forgot all about my racist cousin. His name was Aaron we became good friends he moved away when I was 12. The thing that stuck with me the most was thinking my cousin was an idiot not whether Aaron was black or white. The racist people I have been in contact with usually have a problem with themselves's not the people they are discriminating against.

Plenty of people have enough of their own problems to deal with that they don't have time or energy left to deal with other people's/society's problems, and that's fine.  Especially when it comes to not dealing with them in a way that puts themselves at danger like this black man dealing with KKK members.  ***BUT***.  This is how you change people's minds.  Insulting and demeaning them isn't going to work nearly as well as kindness and persuasion, as showing them that they're wrong rather than simply telling (or claiming).  In today's political climate it's a rather important message, especially for liberals.  I say liberals because they're the pony I'm backing, the one I want to see have a bit more success than they did this year.  Jumping straight to calling anyone worried about immigrants or refugees racist is easy, but it's not going to change minds.  You need to be able to engage in these topics in meaningful ways or else you just make things worse by dismissing and insulting them.  If someone can't openly talk about immigration issues in certain places without being called racist, they'll just go to the places they can.  And the actual racists will be all too happy to engage with them about immigration and refugees.  If there's no reasoned counter-point people will find themselves getting sucked in by the racists.  Because, are they really racists?  ""I was called racist just for asking this question, it's probably the same for them"".   Little do they know that person talking to them is also saying ""Only white people can support western culture"".  So no.  You personally don't have to take responsibility for convincing everyone who disagrees with you, but at least don't be a dick.  Don't just insult and demean those who disagree with you, because it just makes it all that much harder for those trying to convince them to agree with you."

79683	0	a	> how can you hate me when you don't even know me?'  We tend to fear the unknown. I see it often with views of transgender people--NPR posted an article a while back that interviewed a few people in a rural North Carolina town who wanted nothing to do with transgender individuals and likened them to pedophiles. Needless to say, none of them knew a transgender person.  I can imagine it's similar for racist individuals who have only heard about stereotypes (built on fear).

79700	0	a	Having grown up with my grandparents I could say I was pretty racist too. I'm not white, so the notion that only whites can be racist is bullshit.   Two years ago I moved to the middle east to work, at the time I was pretty progressive. Alot of my racist view points had changed and I was beginning to understand the world but what really opened my eyes was moving here. I work day in and day out with about 6 or 7 muslim arabic guys then go online and read how dangerous Muslims are. It's a crazy thing, fear. These guys are just as normal as me and you. Some are shitty, some are good. The one muslim guy told me the other day he really likes Trump.   We need to step out of our echo chambers and expose ourselves to the things we fear and attempt to break these stereotypes. Trust me, its worth it. 
79701	0	a	"> Also, why isn't the burden on white people to come collect their racist folks?   This sentiment in and of itself is racist. The idea that because two people share a skin color they're responsible for each other is really silly when you think about it. he whole point of what this guy did was being the change he wanted to see in the world. I's not the responsibility of black people or white people to ""fix racism"" it's the responsibility of the people who want it gone from the world.   It's funny that this thread is full of people whining (I don't mean you here) about ""Why is it our job?"". Unlike you, those people don't want to admit that they don't want to do it. They want to shift the responsibility. No it's not fair, no you shouldn't have to do it (and you don't). But we live in an imperfect world with imperfect people. If you want change, it's up to you."
79702	0	a	Also, you can't really do that online, in social media, or anywhere else but real life.  EDIT: everyone thinks they can just sit in their computer and closed minded bigots will open up to them. The medium is the message. You're fooling yourself into justifying the energy you put into social media. I've loved the computer since I was 12, which was very long ago. I've had plenty of 'real' relationships here, and I'll tell you, none of them translated in any rational manner into reality.  Sure, I learned how the disconnect works, and of course, one can swim between. But there _is_ a disconnect between online and real life.

Some of the comments I've read up until now, some seem pretty dismissive that there is an actual problem. ""People just blowing things out of proportion."" This isn't Tumblr, some people live this stuff, they don't just make it up for retweets, likes and/or upvotes.   And yes, the media blows it up. Yes, some people blow it out of proportion, but never the less, there is an issue between peoples of different ethnicities, there is prejudice in this country and there is such a thing as systemic racism ingrained in our society.  Only by working together, collectively can we root out this ugliness and move towards a better more cohesive unity.   The reason most people are so frustrated about it, is when they voice their concerns, they are dismissed. Well it's their right. Maybe you're just taking things too seriously. Stop being so sensitive. Well what about so and so in this country suffering this, where is your bleeding heart for them?!   Not actually addressing the issue is one of the issues persons have when bringing these things up. To some of us, the issue is real, because we experience it, we live it. But trying to convey it, we've tried talking, so what's next after talking? What's next after frustration of being ignored by your friends and family WHO AREN'T RACIST, but who also brush you aside?  What then are people supposed to do?  I love that this man's method work. I loved that he touched so many people and forced them to turn their hate in on itself. It's beautiful, it's hope. I don't deny that, but there are reasons that the issue is so loud, and it's not simply the media's fault. When we as a people start hearing one another and working towards a resolution as we should, instead of looking for reasoning to dismantle or discredit the actual problem, then more situations like this can occur. "
79725	0	a	I agree with you in principle, yet whenever I try and put this into practice I end up feeling ridiculous. The other day I typed out a response to someone calling for genocide of all Muslims; carpet-bombing villages and civilians indiscriminately would surely end further terror attacks! I pointed out that, even morals aside, this makes no sense, from a logistical or historical perspective, that there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, that even if you could crush that kind of ideology (never achieved on that scale ever in human history) you'd create a power vacuum that would likely lead to further war, and that the vast overall reduction in human suffering we've achieved in the modern world has been through interlinking cultures and peoples more, not through poorly-thought out blitzkriegs on vast swathes of humanity.  Then I deleted it, because what am I going to do, convince him? By arguing I'm implying that he has an argument. It's wrong to kill civilians. Waging a war against a religion isn't just wrong, it's phenomenally stupid. So I said nothing.  You may well be right, that I need to type these things out, again and again, if I believe them so much. Perhaps it is arrogance of holding these truths to be self-evident that causes such division. Nothing is self-evident. We have a  responsibility to make it evident, and explain why. But goddamn is it depressing.

In fact, more often than not, when you write people off for something they believe, they take the position of the martyr and see your unwillingness to listen as more evidence that they are right.  Refusing to engage people you disagree with is more invalidating to your own beliefs, imo, because you're not willing to hear them questioned, let alone to defend them.  I would have agreed with you more than a year ago, but in the past 14 months, I made close friends with a group of people I could basically describe as conservative. We disagree and debate often, but we love debating and we love each other. And I'll admit I really, really disliked a few of these people before I got to know them. I can't tell you how glad I am to know them now.  And it's because of them that I've come to think the worst thing people do in this country anymore is simply write each other off. We hear someone express an opinion we dislike and we associate with that person a whole plethora of other things we don't like and never give them a chance to get out from the corner we've painted them into. I just think this is one way we hold ourselves and our values a little too highly. Values are important, but not so important that we should close ourselves off from anyone who may disagree.

He talked to a bunch of local farmers about taking the rejects off their hands for a discount, turns out pretty much all the farmers didnt even bother harvesting the rejects, and my chef struck the same deal with all of them, if we pick them we can have them for free, so every year after harvest season my chef got together a bunch of volunteers to go out and pick the rejects, solving both the problems of unsellable produce and starving elders."

For some of them we would have to mix a thickening agent into their drinks (coffee, tea, water, juice) and the spoon feed them.  This product skips a step and gives the person the ability to feed themselves again. I hope the inventor wins a goddamn Nobel prize for this.  
79773	0	a	Having dementia is no life to live. My grandma has that and it is so sad to know she is a shell of the woman she use to be.   Next month is her birthday and as a family we celebrate with her and every year and every food she thinks we are trying to poison her. I wish there was someway to help but I really don't know what more can be done. 
79774	0	a	The man even designed the BOX to make it easy and enticing.   I love the look on his grandma's face when she sees the delightful box of pretty colored candies he brought her.   What a great guy. He not only helped his own grammy, but countless others. 
79775	0	a	This is genius. I hope it can be produced at a pricepoint to help even the less advantaged.  One of the things that made me realise my mom was much further in decline than had been communicated to me was the trouble she had with getting water and drinking from a cup. Every single thing that made it difficult for her would have been addressed perfectly by these.
79776	0	a	"Does anyone know if these are available for purchase online? My grandmother has dementia and has had to go to the hospital due to dehydration. She no longer buys ""real"" food at the store anymore, instead buying candy and ice cream. My sister has to sneak actual meals into her cart. I feel like these would really help her."
79777	0	a	Reading the article made me realize just how debilitating dementia can be. Besides not recognizing your own needs or how to satisfy them. There's a point about the box having a clear lid so the person knows what/where they are at all times, and being able to open (and keep open) with a one-hand movement, because multi-step operations (put down box, open lid, replace lid, use two hands to pull off lid rather than tilt up hinged lid) are more than can be handled.  But what really got me was that, in the video, the grandmother takes one, and still has it in one hand while asking/reaching for another. Not knowing she already had one. Of course Grandson offers the box and she keeping eating them, still holding onto the one she took earlier. Very interesting.   (Also, for those asking the same thing - doesnt seem to be flavored, but the jellies are 90% water, 10% gel and electrolytes, to better combat dehydration. The color/shape alone seems to be appealing enough. Really well-thought out and executed!)

79785	0	a	Yep, my mother works with brain-injured adults, and this looks like it could be a real game-changer for hydration, the thickening stuff sucks to deal with, and the patients don't care for it.  The only issue I can see is that the people who don't need it will probably get jealous of the one getting the 'candy/treats'
79786	0	a	My husbands uncle recently had a stroke and fell right into the depths of dementia. He’s angry, hateful, and violent. He kicked a nurse in the face yesterday so he spends most of his time in restraints and medicated. He doesn’t recognize his wife or children anymore. It’s absolutely horrible. I wouldn’t wish that life on anyone. 
79787	0	a	I’ve been through this with two family members. It’s really rough!  I think the best thing might be to let her go. That means comfort care and having a “DNR” filled out. If she is really gone and no longer has any quality in her life, you could have your family agree to make sure she doesn’t get antibiotics.   That’s what I will want for myself if I ever develop dementia.   
79788	0	a	It can be very different from person to person. I’ve been taking care of my mom for 16 years. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 18 years ago.  Now, she barely recognizes me, sometimes still remembers her own name, can’t do anything without help, but she’s a happy and friendly person for the most part, loves to listen to music, and she’s not suffering at all. Every now and then she even manages to surprise me with an unexpected quip or ironic remark, while most of the time she’s barely able to produce a short coherent sentence beyond common phrases or words.  And she’s not abusive or verbally aggressive.  I’ve seen her go through all stages so far, with ups and downs, but in her case, she’s having a good life. She’s 91, old and frail now, and taking care of her is really exhausting. My own social life is basically dead, but I wouldn’t say hers is no life to live.  The mileage can vary a lot between dementia patients.  Edit: I would say that the one thing that helped most in managing the worst problems was the fact that she’s lived and still lives in a very stable environment (at home). And gradually I practiced a lot of everyday life things with her. One thing that was also vital was to accustom her to being touched pretty much everywhere. She was not the type of person to touch others a lot or being touched. But now she likes a good hug, and she doesn’t feel uncomfortable if I clean her or change her clothes etc. Years of conditioning and doing the same things over and over, slowly adapting to changes... I believe that’s one of the keys to make a lot of things potentially easier. And this is one of the things that old-age homes mostly can’t deliver, of course.  Also, learning to let go of feeling under pressure or thinking things have to get done in a certain time limit is important. Feeling under time pressure is poison for both sides. It took a little while to not feel annoyed anymore if I have to explain things 5 or 6 times if necessary. Patience gets you pretty far.  As long as the person you take care of isn’t the aggressive kind, of course. But even then a calm demeanor can be helpful.
79789	0	a	That's what makes this something great imo. The eatable water isn't new. 
79790	0	a	Except it now costs $30 a day instead of 3 cups of tap water.   There must be a better container system for plain water, because this will be prohibitively expensive for most people.  Cheaper than an IV, I suppose.
79791	0	a	You can just make jello and decrease the sugar. It's the same thing and used as treatment just for this type of thing.
79792	0	a	My mother had dementia and died from it. The last month or so she began to stop eating, but drinking slowed down first. We tried things like ice cream, pudding, then moved on to Ensure and an extra rich protein drink. That wasn’t as different as I thought I guess because her stomach was empty.   I agree the color of these jellies would entice her to eat them but as with everything else it’s part of the process. It has its place. Sadly at the end she stopped taking anything by mouth. Since I had a DNR in place she received palliative care only. Her death was peaceful and painless.

And that's ***exactly*** what they got - as that it was (and *IS*) a roaring success.  Don't believe me? Here's the words, right from the horse's mouth:  “You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”  - John Ehrlichman, who served 18 months in prison for his central role in the Watergate scandal, was Nixon’s chief domestic advisor when the president announced the “War on Drugs” in 1971.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nixon-drug-war-racist_us_56f16a0ae4b03a640a6bbda1  https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/"

79815	0	a	Kids go through unhealthy phases, and it is *very* important not to take the easy route.  That said, my daughter (2 years old) currently only wants to eat mac and cheese, cereal, or hotdogs. She will refuse anything else, even when complaining of hunger. We held out for a week before we finally caved and bought a pack of hotdogs, which she ate ravenously. She's also refusing to poop, and we've resorted to stool softeners.  Sometimes when parenting, you have to accept that what is *best*, and what *actually works*, are different things.
79816	0	a	Funny how this response only ever comes from people who have never dealt with a child who outright refuses plain water and will simply just go without instead when other options are taken away. My 10 year old daughter refused water to the point of a getting a kidney infection. Should I have poured it down her throat?
79817	0	a	No, it's entirely gelatinized, it's essentially a jello jiggler with a coating that makes it not slimy (and a healthier ratio of sugar/electrolyte).  And the reason to not give them to everyone would probably be price.  You can give fluids by IV to everyone too, but if you can drink from a glass, that's a really expensive/unnecessary way to get hydrated.  People with brain injuries have weird reactions to things, both things they get and things they don't get.  Some of the patients who didn't smoke would get upset when ones who did got cigarettes and they didn't.

So many are quick to blame the parents but problems like this can arise from food and drink at school, friends and family (especially events like Birthday Parties and such), and even from watching TV.  The show [Caillou](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2mzfyj/comment/cm94vtr) is notorious for teaching children bad habits and I have seen several people complain that their children never threw temper tantrums until after watching the show.  I've heard the argument ""just don't give what they want, you're the adult"" so many times and it sounds good on paper until they try it out for themselves and their kid is literally starving of their own volition and possibly needs a trip to the ER.  Sometimes a compromise has to be reached before progress can be made - and that's true for a lot more than just parenting."

79873	0	a	"Depends what you mean by television. From a British point of view, I don't know how bad American terrestrial channel shows are. In Britain, our channels make both really good stuff and bad stuff. Take ITV for instance, made Broadchurch which is an amazing murder mystery drama starring David Tennant but also made stuff like I'm a celebrity, which although can be entertaining is ultimately shit TV.  However I think the main distinction is shows which have come out of not so traditional channels (or at least I think so) like HBO and AMC, as well as Netflix, which are currently making some absolutely amazing shows. I cannot contain my excitement around shows like Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, OITNB, House of Cards, Game of Thrones and particularly at the minute, Westworld. Their actors are sensational, their writing is captivating, their visuals are stunning. So although it was always unwise to refer to ""TV"" as one entity, I feel like it's particularly unwise now. The gulf between Westworld and American Idol is huge. The idea that TV entertainment has run its course because X Factor, American Idol etc are failing is wrong, which is good, because I feel like millennials and especially now generation Z members want good exciting TV which I suppose is more film like, but that's a different discussion  TL;DR Popularity contest shows dying doesn't mean TV is dead, it's just changing and imo definitely for the better"

By question, I mean I asked my pediatrician and he was very stern on it being non-optional. Two arguments ended up convincing me it was definitely the right decision. A- ask anyone who has seen the devastating effects of these illnesses and they'll always choose to vaccinate. B- you read some articles on the internet, you didn't study medicine for 8+ years and then some.   Some friends of ours are, so far, choosing not to vaccinate. Their son is 5 months old and has never seen the pediatrician. They used an anti-vaxxing midwife, who they've continued to check in with. I was pretty post-partum-y and I know better than to pressure a new mom, but their decisions bother me on a level I don't even understand. I also know from my personal experience with a doula in a birthing center, the medical attention they deem relevant to a 'natural phenomenon' and babies is pretty off from the norm. My doula had instructed me to opt out of some vaccines too.   It's like this polarization, babies aren't super medically needy, but there's medical direction that sets them up for success. The point I wanted to make and failed is that, despite all these articles making well-intended parents out to be bad guys, I'd like to support my friends in the right direction and I don't know how to.

If he gets measles because his daughter was exposed at school, best case scenario he never walks again, but it's far more likely it would kill him.  School in our district have nut-free classrooms for kids allergic to peanuts.  If only they had nut-free classrooms for kids at higher risk of death from anti-vax nuts.
79905	0	a	I know that being an anti-science moron is kind of popular these days, but when that behavior starts to bring back lethal diseases that used to be well under control, governments need to step in and put a stop to it.  Humanity's capacity for stupid is nearly unfathomable.  This is one of the key reasons we simply must have governments and regulation.  As a species, we are not wise or compassionate enough to live in total independent freedom.

All because I got my shots as a baby -- because I got older instead of dying from a preventable disease.

79911	0	a	If I remember it correctly in France you can't get into school without being vaccinated. 
79912	0	a	It's important to remember that vaccines are not 100% effective. We simply depend on high enough vaccination levels to prevent the natural spread. So it's possible for a parent to be responsible and get all of their kid's vaccinations on schedule, and then have their kid get sick and die just because some other parents didn't vaccinate their kids, allowing the disease to spread.   My kids may have their vaccinations, but if I hear that someone doesn't vaccinate, then they end up on the no-contact list. 
79913	0	a	That's the cruel irony of it.  People afraid that vaccines will harm their children are endangering children who are *actually* harmed by vaccines.  
79914	0	a	My grandmother got shingles in her 80's.  She survived a world war, an abusive marriage, manual labour jobs that ruined joints that weren't already ruined by rheumatoid arthritis and never in my life did I hear her complain. She said if her shingles ever came back she would kill herself.  She had permanent nerve damage too. Shingles are the worst.  
79915	0	a	Something else that's worth pointing out.  Not all viruses are nice to children. In fact, most are just as deadly to children as they are to adults.   So it's not an option to skip the vaccination and get the disease instead, like some people seem to believe.

Doctor at the quack shack on campus promptly escorted me out the secret back door and told me DO NOT STEP FOOT on campus for one week.  I went back to my apartment and had hallucinations about people visiting me and putting cold rags on my face.  I still have a few scars.    Get your babies vaccinated!!

79921	0	a	I agree! The biggest hurdle is that I have no idea how to (politely) change their minds. I'm in a Facebook group for local moms and I see anti vax posts EVERY day.

79932	0	a	It's SUPPOSED to be that eay in most parts of the USA. You have to provide proof of immunization each year to the school in order for your child to attend.  The problem is, all you have to do is say you object to it on religious grounds, and you can get away with not vaccinating.
79933	0	a	It's also super important for babies that are too young to get vaccinated, and the elderly and immune deficient. In Australia, babies can't be fully vaccinated for whooping cough (pertussis) until the are 6 months old (needs 3 separate shots). I imagine other countries would be similar. Mothers can be vaccinated during pregnancy, with a 91% chance the baby will receive immunity. Whooping cough is often deadly in young babies, who can cough so much they can't breathe, and organs can shut down. This is why vaccines are super important. [Source] (http://immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/IT0146-cnt)  It is recommended that close family contacts such as parents, siblings, grandparents and frequent visitors are vaccinated before the baby is born. There are cases where a sibling's unvaccinated playmate passes the disease on to a newborn and the baby dies. I cannot imagine anything more heartbreaking.

There are laws, government, courts, police etc. You don't have the freedom to murder someone and get away with it, or take someone else's property etc. The solutions being discussed in the article are not allowing unvaccinated children into public schools or day care centres, holding back their child care rebates, or fining them. The aim is to make it more difficult to not immunise your children and reduce the spread of diseases, not to forcefully inject anyone against their will. 
79941	0	a	Seriously. These parents are not only showing their kids that they would rather have them suffer and potentially die from a preventable disease than be autistic, but also, they're showing other autistic children that their state of being is far worse than potentially dying from an awful disease.   It's horrible on multiple levels. 
79942	0	a	I probably have mild Autism. I'm going for a screening in a few weeks. I definitely prefer it to being dead, mangled, paralyzed, or really any major symptom of the various diseases for which I've been vaccinated. It'd be a good trade, if it was one at all.

After brushing her teeth and hair, she turned around to find her bed completely engulfed in flames.  She made an attempt to extinguish the flames herself by throwing blankets and pillows on the fire.  The smoke and heat were so overwhelming that she immediately got disoriented, gave up fighting the fire, and decided to flee.

I just wish that being humble and having integrity didn't also mean you go under the radar. But it's kind of a catch 22. He's a great example though.
80061	0	a	He's the *county* mayor (of Salt Lake County), not the mayor of Salt Lake City. Just a clarification since the title wasn't clear. I live in Salt Lake City and county and I can confirm he is a good guy. He's also a Democrat in a state dominated by Republicans.

After I left I realized that Mormons who love and live their religion are some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. My issues are not with them but with the leadership and the organization itself and I think Mormons deserve better. You deserve to know that you are amazing and that you need to stop being so hard on yourself.    This mayor is a great example, if he is indeed Mormon, of Mormons that put in the extra effort to really live like Christ might have.

If you do something like this and say ""Michael Jackson's birthday is ..."" and then check to see if anybody else has it, it becomes the predictable probability where for each individual, they would have a ~1/365 chance of having that birthday (given that birthdays are assumed to be distributed evenly enough throughout the year)."

At the time, a young man, in my early twenties, I took the statement to be a cynical criticism of our attention-hungry nature, ""look at me and all the good I am doing,"" which was a way more Rand-esque interpretation of the passage than His Holiness the Dalai Lama could have ever intended.  Now, after years of thinking on it, I see that the meaning was a lot more straight-forward. If you are going to be known for something, to take pleasure in something, why not make your self useful to the people around you, and do some good while you are at it? You lose nothing by showing compassion. You can have your pride, and your strength, and your wealth,   and your giant booty, but you also get the added pleasure of knowing that you made the world a slightly better place."

Gave it up twice. But once I figured that out, it took off.  First, I lied about knowing HTML to get my first job (there was an opening for online editor for a series of magazines), and set out to learn that as quick as I could.   Then I started seeing CSS, so I found out I needed to learn that. Sat down and would design an email or something (I was learning Photoshop at the time, too), then built it.   Then I wanted to be able to do some things in WordPress, so I realized I had to learn jQuery. Found a free online jQuery course and could not understand a word. Worked late every night trying to take the course and understanding nothing. Practiced a lot of HTML/CSS instead.  Tried jQuery again, could not understand it. This about year 2-3 out of college.   Decided to try PHP a few months later. Found a $10 online course on some MOOC site and even though my company had summer hours (work 8:30-5 M-Th and you can leave half day on Friday), I would stay after on Friday's and take the courses and practice. Started dating my now wife (who had one kid) whom I completely credit with all my success.  3 months later a project came up to do a complete database migration for a legacy project from MSSQL and Cold Fusion to PHP/MySQL. I said ""I can do it"". Boss strangely let me work on it. 4 weeks later I had learned enough MSSQL and PHP to complete it (working through a virtualized Windows instance that I had set up because we used macs) to major kudos from my company.   Asked if I could do more work like that I could do. They said sure, we have 17 websites on a decade old CMS that need to be moved to WordPress, can you do it? I said of course. Researched what software people were using now a days (2015) to manage development for multiple environments. Realized I had to understand version control to work at the top places and to deploy rapidly, so I learned Git. Learned about Vagrant and system administration that way. Because I could never remember how to do things, and I was working on a lot so I had to work fast, I began writing automation scripts for everything. Also, girlfriend had our first baby, so we were taking care of that, her parents got divorced and her mom got breast cancer, so I was helping with that stuff. Also, there's another 7 year old in the mix that was in a million activities that I took her to.  A friend suggested I apply at (my next place of work) because she said they always need devs. Place ends up being one of the top 5 marketing agencies in the U.S. (which I found out just prior to the interview when I was researching the company; gotta be prepared for those interviews and impress them with how much you want to be there). Interviewed with one of the VPs and that was it for my first interview and he basically offered me a job (he didn't know what; just wanted me to work there) as I walked out the door. We talked about migrations, virtualization, managing development and automation, and I asked a lot of questions about their technology. Interviewed with a few other people just to find out where I was going to work. They hired me as junior DevOps guy in late 2015 and I happened to work with and get mentored by a very brilliant sys/db-admin/developer.   Started day 1 realizing I knew nothing about what they wanted me to know. Began learning real automation (Chef, Terraform, Vagrant, Vault, Consul), system administration (Nginx, MySQL, MSSQL, Redis, Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows), more relevant languages (Golang, Python, Ruby), security (SAML, encryption) as well as IAAS and building highly available apps and services (AWS, Azure, DNS, Networking). A lot was learned through day to day work, but a lot was just keeping track of software that had come out, practicing with it, installing it, running it, breaking it, integrating it, and then proposing uses and discussing how we can benefit or if we should avoid it. A lot was learned as well by seeing something,  realizing I didn't know it was well as someone else, and digging in to learn as quick as I could and taking any projects that were going to be hard or scary or were going to use technology/languages/tools that I wasn't an expert at. This was all 2015 to 2017. During this period, I was also raising our daughter, taking care of hers (she was in 3rd grade), bought our first house, got married, and took care of her mom (cleaning, house work, repairs) because my wife got really sick and couldn't get over there (still is very very sick and bedridden).  Company was kind of falling apart in the web/digital space so I started looking elsewhere. Found an amazing place that I thought I would never get an interview at. Sent over my resume anyway. Got an email 45 minutes later and had a phone interview that evening. Interview with recruiter then with DevOps Principal and Chief DevOps Architect and got a job offer.  That's my story. If I can do that while raising an infant/toddler and a 2nd-4th grader, taking care of a sick wife, cooking all the meals/doing all the laundry/doing all the yard work/doing all the house work, coaching a sports team, coaching some friends in olympic weightlifting, buying and repairing an older house, and taking care of a sick older woman (and my mentally handicapped brother), you should be making six figures within a few years. If I can do it in 5, there's no reason a healthy, young, single person can't do it in 3. Good luck!  Edit:  > in the job interview process how were you able to demonstrate the skills you learned to potential employers  To answer this: My resume included a breakdown of major projects I had taken at each company, with a description of software used, things learned, mistakes made, etc. I had real examples of ideas I had taken from inception to delivery and the impact they had on operations.   In the interview, I never spoke negatively about the place I was leaving. They helped make me. Sure, it's miserable there at the end and that's why I was leaving, but it might be miserable when I leave the place I'm interviewing at. Your future employer will also be your former employer one day, and if you're shitting on your former now, you're going to be shitting on your former in the future. And they don't need that. I spoke a lot about technology I used and why; languages and technology I had to learn and why/how. How I worked with other people to get it done. Be the person you would want to hire if you were in charge of the department so that you do have things to say when you're interviewing. Then the technology you learn, the projects you take, the times you lead and the times you follow and take directions, come out naturally during the interview and you become everyone's greatest asset. Then everyone wants you to work for them."

80215	0	a	Why do I think Trump will soon remove the ban?
80216	0	a	Okay, so, the ozone layer is a layer of the atmosphere made of, well, ozone. Ozone absorbs UV light, which is the type of light that can damage your cells- meaning it gives you sunburns and skin cancer. The Sun puts out a huge amount of UV light, enough to destroy most life on the planet. Luckily, the ozone layer protects us. The problem was that a few decades ago, companies started using CFCs, a special type of gas, as a propellant for spray bottles, among other things. It didn't take long to realize that CFCs react with ozone and destroy it, but by that point, there was already a giant hole in the ozone layer. The use of CFCs was outlawed worldwide, and because ozone is actually created when UV light hits the air, the hole has begun to slowly heal over.  Climate change is different. It concerns greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide, which reflects infrared light. Infrared light turns mostly into heat, and things that are hot shine infrared light (which is why old lightbulbs put out so much heat- they shine mostly in infrared). This means that sunlight can get into the atmosphere, but not back out, so the temperature slowly rises. Part two of the problem is that, as the temperature rises, the ice at the North and South poles begin to melt, releasing methane gas that was trapped inside. Methane is a *much* more powerful greenhouse gas, and this can cause a feedback loop where the ice melts more, releasing more gas, making it hotter, making the ice melt faster.  There's a lot more important stuff to consider about both issues, but hopefully this gets the basic gist across. Please tell me if you have more questions.
80217	0	a	A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.  EDIT: Jesus, [it's a line from the South Park episode](https://southpark.cc.com/clips/104229/the-media-takes-notice). I didn't think I'd get so many lame insults and irrelevant Led Zeppelin jokes for making this reference, but lesson learned.

80219	0	a	Don't be ridiculous. There would be no benefit to bringing them back. We have better, cheaper alternatives now.
80220	0	a	That was the best ELI5 I've read so far, thank you very much.  I was always under the assumption that the greenhouses gasses and the ozone layer were somehow correlated but I was obviously wrong.  So basically one could say that the ozone hole was a big problem but it's a problem completely removed from climate change, yes?
80221	0	a	Did it make you feel like cryin, or did you think it was kinda gay?
80222	0	a	We have lots of better, cheaper alternatives to coal too.  But Trump ran on a pro-coal platform.
80223	0	a	Yup. It was a very big and immediate problem, which is why every nation in the world agreed to stop using them. Climate change is just as big of a problem, but it's on a much longer timescale, so we don't notice it's effects as much.  It should also be noted that CFCs are one of the most powerful greenhouse gasses around, many thousands of times better at trapping heat than CO2. Unfortunately, CFCs were replaced with HFCs, which are just as good at trapping heat, the only difference is that they don't destroy ozone.
80224	0	a	But Coal has a large civilian community who want it. It's popular to run for it in communities. This not really.  Edit:Yes, coal is not the future. I don't identify with it. Just a lot of people are very very supportive of it. That is why trump ran with it. Disenfranchised communities see coal dying as a tradegy, he can translate this into votes.

Not whooping cough, but just coughing constantly, super high fever, unable to keep food down, etc etc. I had sent her an audio clip of a child with whooping cough not long before, with a message something like ""this is the sound of a child dying of a preventable disease.""

80310	0	a	Now, I say this as someone who is really against wearing fur or even leather. I just naturally find it creepy, and don't like doing it for vanity. But I don't claim to be a vegetarian or actively involved in animal rights.  But I do think there's an odd dichotomy how we look at things like fur farms as categorically different than mass farms for animals raised as food. I absolutely agree that fur farms shouldn't exist and the animals are treated terribly. But food animals are definitely not treated great and is a much bigger market.   I'm not against this legislation, it's probably a step in the right direction. But it just smells to me  like it's a token gesture to take the focus away from the more prevalent food producing industry.

Their living conditions are quite similar to caged hens.  **Edit: I was speaking about fur farms in general, not specifically those in Norway. Since I don't yet speak Norwegian I'm not able to google information in Norwegian, but [here's an article in English](http://www.newsinenglish.no/2013/08/27/fur-farming-under-probe/) about similar living conditions found on a fur farm in Norway.**  Edit 2: [Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/7qip1a/norway_announces_total_ban_on_fur_farming/dspm2s8/?st=jcg8mssh&sh=249995e4).  Yes, fur farms are supposed to follow certain laws. Yes, some of them probably do. But not all of them. It's very difficult and expensive to regulate them, as well as trust that they follow these laws. Hence why mistreatment is often exposed via undercover animal rights groups who film (before you automatically dismiss any evidence that comes from animal rights activists).
80317	0	a	Which is why fur imports should be banned along with production if you decide to go this way. 
80318	0	a	You know that furry part of the hood on many parkas?  Fox, coyote, etc.  I don't dare imagine how many coyotes had to die for the jacket I'm wearing today.
80319	0	a	Should also add that the ban will, in any case, not be in place before 2025 at the earliest.  
80320	0	a	Thats because its not really profitable if you take properly care of the animals. Switzerland had it right tho, either you do it right, or you dont do it.  So people dont do it.
80321	0	a	Fuck, legal in most the US. I hadn’t even thought about fur in so long, I didn’t understand the title at first.
80322	0	a	You would think that the farms would adapt and start to keep the animals and kill them in kinder ways since this hurts the reputation of fur being terrible and bans like in Norway.  But maybe they are not thinking the long term or assume there would be negativity regarding fur in any case.
80323	0	a	My father is a mink farmer who lives in Denmark, and i can tell that this is absolutely a lie. In Denmark mink are killed by gas, which makes the mink sleep rather fast and die during that sleep, giving them the least physical pain possible.
80324	0	a	And as a forth Norwegian I should probably add, this is will just stop Norwegian fur farms, which has been held to atleast a minimum of animal welfare standars.   Now we open the marcet for foreign fur-farms (who do as they want without us having any possibility to regulate the conditions) to up their production to import fur to Norway. But I guess it's a nice symbol policy atleast. 
80325	0	a	The farmers have promised and promised to start treating the animals nice.  But it never happened. So now it's been enough shit. The farms are running deficits without subsidies. Now the money goes. And so will the farms.  They will not technically be illegal in many years. They will just die due to lack of profitability.
80326	0	a	The problem is that even though we have rules and laws preventing these inhumane ways, surprise visits always end up uncovering disgusting neglect and mistreatment.  The same goes for the meat industry, really. Just recently there was a report in national news showing horrifying scenes from three different pig farms in Rogaland, as a result of authorities showing up without prior notice.  But sadly, the meat industry is virtually immune to slaps on the wrist now, and nothing ever comes of it.
80327	0	a	As a fifth norwegian I feel obliged to also inform that I'm norwegian.
80328	0	a	> Doesn't this mean that it just shifts the production to other countries where they treat the animals even worse? >  > Seems pointless unless the sale of fur itself is banned (or the same restrictions are applied for both local and imported products)  Doing the right thing is never pointless, even though there's much more work to do. It's not only with fur that there's a big discrepancy between what's allowed in a country (for example Switzerland) and what can be imported. Today, there's almost no possibility (says the importer) to prove the history of a product. In all honesty, they don't care and are not pressed to do this effort.

80389	0	a	This is an important distinction between Obama and Trump that goes unremarked upon:  While Obama was a fantastic president, Top 15 easily, he was not a perfect president. He made errors, he made decisions that were ethically questionable, and there are a couple issues he probably didn't do enough to address when he had the power to (even taking congressional interference into account). Those mistakes shouldn't be ignored, but the reason we are willing to overlook them, the reason we are able to look at his presidency honestly and with reverence is that he never gave the impression he was operating in bad faith.  He was a good man, an honest man, and man with a true desire to make things better for Americans. He proved that every moment of his life before and during his candidacy, in the way he spoke and the things he choose to do. So when he slipped up, we gave him the benefit of the doubt. We knew he was trying, we trusted that what he was doing was what he genuinely believed was the best course of action for *us*.  Trump is the polar opposite. He doesn't get the benefit of the doubt and he gets no credit for acts of good will on the very few occasions he makes them. He's a walking example of bad faith. If you behave the way he does, no one will ever assume you made a genuine mistake. They will always assume you're doing something intentionally, for potentially self serving or evil motives, or you just didn't care.  That is the importance of being a respectable person. You build trust, and that trust cushions your mistakes. Even Bush Jr had a degree of good faith cushioning, though he burned it up. Trump has no cushion, only a bed of spikes.  Edit: wording
80390	0	a	I always kind of jokingly say that he is my favorite Republican. Cause I do like him but he wasn't ever left enough for me and I don't really see how he's actually a Democrat aside from in the context of a fucked up Overton window.

80395	0	a	Yes Obama's presidency demonstrated his humanity and also showed that like all humans he is fallible. There will never be a perfect president. There is just no way that any human could keep all those plates in the air and never let one fall. But I too believe that he did his best and did an amazing job and his heart was in the right place.
80396	0	a	This is exactly how I always felt about the obama presidency put into words. As someone who identifies as a right leaning independant I disagreed with him often. But his approach always made it feel as the battle of opposing logic. Valid arguments to be had on both sides.   Not a battle of who talks worse about the other like today.
80397	0	a	I think the problem was with his campaign. He was very idealistic in his promises with an overwhelmingly positive message of hope. Which in a democracy like the US is very difficult to implement in a presidential term.   He quickly realized that pragmatic, incremental change is the way to go. He has said so himself in various interviews that his ultimate goal is to nudge the country in the direction towards progressiveness. The people who voted for him I guess had way too many unrealistic expectations because of his campaign.
80398	0	a	That’s because even the “evil” characters have some purpose and rationality behind their actions that you could silently understand. That’s the beauty of GOT bad guys is that you may not agree with them but you do understand. I understand why Jamie threw Bran off of the tower, if he didn’t he, his sister, and likely their children would be killed by Robert. I understand why Cercei blew up the cathedral, she did it to protect her family from outside influence and protect herself from being locked up. We see the worst parts of ourselves in these people and that’s where the connection is and we know that given the temptations and life they live we know deep down that we might choose similar path or actions as they do. I would 100% blow up the Sept if I was in as deep as Cercei was. The only one we all hated was Jeoffrey and we hated him because he had no purpose beyond being a twisted little shit.

Not flaming you here, but it does get annoying seeing Tywin be worshipped and praised as 'relatable' over and over. The guy ordered an enemy queen's genitals torn out. He forced Tyrion to watch his lover get raped by an entire squad of soldiers, made him fuck her after that, and then forbade him from seeing her (if my facts are right). He singlehandedly brutally destroyed The House of The Raynes by blocking the entrance of the mine they were hiding in, and sent water down through the holes to drown them all. He was selfish. He was cold to his family. He wasn't 'tough', he was just a sociopathic asshole. Again, I'm not trying to call you out specifically, I just feel like people don't see Tywin for what he was.

80425	0	a	Eh, probably not.  The aircraft itself is a fixed width.  Going forward, manufacturers could design around this, but that's a long way off.  So the issue is how many seats can they pack into a row.  Aisle widths are regulated for safety, so you can't shrink those.  So unless the plane width is perfectly divisible by the min. seat width minus the aisle width, there's going to be extra.  That extra could go to wider aisles, but that doesn't make sense, so it'll go to the seats.  In reality, most seating configurations already meet these requirements and nothing will change.  In the ultra-cramped configurations, they'll have to remove a seat from each row to comply.

The United case that spawned this they dragged the doctor off kicking and screaming, United just really fucked up.

Your 1980s clip implies that welfare recipients don't work or are encouraged to not work.   [Welfare recipients are often characterized as lazy, simply waiting for the next month's benefits to roll in. But nearly 73% of people receiving public benefits are members of working families.](http://mashable.com/2015/07/27/welfare-myths-debunked/#0P3VKXfKYZqR)  This message of demonizing the helped by welfare is the same ""welfare queen"" BS Reagan was pushing. It's the same one Republicans today love to push, insisting ""urban people"" don't have any work ethic.   Cutting welfare and food stamps from poor families won't put fathers back in houses. If you really think it will, you need to explain how exactly a family getting aid encourages fathers to move out.  Drug war policies of uneven enforcement (crack/cocaine sentencing disparity) ARE destroying the black family unit. I think you need to explain how foodstamps do the same.  All you are doing is parroting right-wing attacks on the welfare state.  Taking two basically unconnected subjects (drug war, and welfare) and and trying to pair t hem together to blame welfare.   Conservatives blamed rising unemployment numbers and expanding welfare rolls on expanded anti-poverty programs, when [the research](http://theweek.com/articles/449215/does-welfare-make-people-lazy) said that post-2008 unemployment and welfare use was due to a job shortage.  Caused by the financial crisis.   Republicans deregulate the financial industry, economy implodes, jobs are lost, people go on welfare.  ""AHA"" think the Republicans, this is the fault of welfare.  Same BS different day.   Way to piggy back destruction of the social safety net onto an article about the War on Drugs.  Go away Paul Ryan.   [Here's some more lies about welfare you can trot out next time there is discussion about an unrelated topic](http://mashable.com/2015/07/27/welfare-myths-debunked/#0P3VKXfKYZqR)   It's not two parties ""both trying to keep the black man down"", but one party is trying to destroy food stamps even though it [reduces poverty](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/us/food-stamp-program-helping-reduce-poverty.html)   >Combine this with a media that brainwashes the youth with a “gangsta” message worshiping money, violence and sex.  And why are you trying to blame the ""media"" for this. Do you think Ted Turner was just sitting at home thinking  ""yeah, but this music video should have more guns."" The elements of black culture you are talking about are basically a coping mechanism against centuries of discrimination. Don't blame it on the media, unless you want to blame it in William Randolph Hearst.

I can't help but think why wouldn't the hotels do this on their own when the rooms will just sit empty, when the weather is life threatening and I know power and water cost, so if nothing else, at least offer a very low rate.   Edit: As people have pointed out, with the homeless community is not that easy. Unfortunately with drug use, alcoholism, and mental illness it makes it difficult to put trust into them. Even paying, we have to have a credit card on file in case we steal or damage anything. So I can imagine hotels wouldn't take this risk, but I just hope they do at least offer the payee the best rate. 😊 After thinking though the reality I hope she doesn't get hit with a lot of ""check out fees"" from theft.  I know Kristen Bell spoke about her on her Instagram and gave $5k and provided a link for others. So hopefully, that will help with the cost. I also know Ellen is besties with Kristen and will probably have this saint on her show and hopefully give her money.  "

She explained that the people who live in this “tent city” were scared of leaving and the city taking all of their belongings.

80558	0	a	Declawed cats are surrendered to shelters quite often. They are more likely to bite because they can’t use a scratch as a warning sign so people will dump them. We have seen quite a few that end up on long term pain medication because of the arthritis that develops in their legs. It’s not illegal to do in the town I live in but I’m thankful to work for a veterinarian that refuses to do them.

80570	0	a	Piggybacking your comment to point out that declawing a cat involves cutting off the entire end of its toes, akin to removing a fingernail on a human by removing the bone from the joint at the knuckle above the nail.   It leaves the cat mutilated and makes it harder for them to move around, difficult if not impossible to climb and removes their primary defense, meaning they cannot run or warn, so they have to resort to attacking via biting as their only defence.   It's illegal in much of the world for good reasons. It's barbaric.  Edit : some people keep mentioning how I can defend spaying and neutering and condemn declawing, I will clarify this.  A cat with claws is its natural state and having claws usually causes the cat no issues whatsoever, however, removing the claws does cause a lot of issues SOME of the time. A skilled vet can minimise these issues, but it doesn't negate that fact that the only reason to declaw a cat is beause the human isn't willing to adjust their expectations of the cat.  Spaying and neutering prevents pregnancy, also prevents prostate issues, cancer, polycystic ovaries, and various hormonal ailments along with reducing aggressive hormones making the animal more docile. If done young this is usually and in and out procedure which the animal recovers from in a few days with no ill effects.  I train dogs as my job and also work with various other animals and work alongside veterinarians and animal psychologists. I have a real passion for animals and the short of it is, do not get a pet if YOU are not willing to adjust to that animals needs.  Additional information regarding declawing linked below as some people still refuse to accept what declawing is.   -----------------------------------------  [Wikipedia] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychectomy) article on what declawing involves.   [How is a cat declawed?] (http://m.humanesociety.org/animals/cats/tips/declawing.html)   The standard method of declawing is amputating with a scalpel or guillotine clipper. The wounds are closed with stitches or surgical glue, and the feet are bandaged.  Another method is laser surgery, in which a small, intense beam of light cuts through tissue by heating and vaporizing it. However, it's still the amputation of the last toe bone of the cat and carries with it the same long-term risks of lameness and behavioral problems as does declawing with scalpels or clippers.  If performed on a human being, declawing would be like cutting off each finger at the last knuckle.
80571	0	a	"I recently adopted a one-year kitty who was declawed. She'd been adopted as a kitten and in the few months between that and being surrendered back, the owners had declawed her. Didn't mention it to the shelter and the shelter didn't notice (frankly I don't have a high opinion of their awareness or medical ability), it wasn't on any paperwork, and since she had a bad URI at the store that served as an adoption location, they didn't know because she was lethargic.   I got her home, looked to see where she was in my clipping rotation, and... she's not in the clipping rotation. Thank god all of my cats are indoor only. I hate the idea that someone may have gotten her home and tried to make her indoor/outdoor.   No biting or litter issues but she doesn't like having her feet touched. She does enjoy ""scratching"" sisal posts, I guess they feel good. "
80572	0	a	I work at a shelter and this is so true. They also tend to have litter box issues because the litter hurts their feet. Some people can deal with the stuff you mentioned and adopt the cat, but almost no one wants a cat that won't use a litter box.
80573	0	a	I'm in the UK and it's the first time I've even heard of declawing a cat.  Here shredded sofas and wallpaper are just part of cat ownership and no one even thinks about it.  
80574	0	a	Put the pencil down sir
80575	0	a	The only thing I can think of is if the cat is hurting themselves. My friend just got a cat last week that was left in a barn to die. The poor little guy has some kind of mental issues. For some reason he can't seem to control his claws and when he tries cleaning his face, he ends up scratching it all up and it bleeds. The other day he actually got his claw stuck in his nose. They are taking him to the vet to try and find out if he is mentally disabled and to possibly declaw him because it's actually hurting him. I think cases like that should be excused for having the cat declawed as it actually protects them from themselves.

80581	0	a	Yep. Also, they tend to have very tender feet for the rest of their lives making using a litter box painful (all that digging and scratching) which they then typically associate the pain they experience in the box with the box itself. Then they avoid the box bc in their brains box = pain. So now you've got a cat who refuses to use a litter box. There are many alternatives to having your cats toes cut off. I used to work as a vet tech in a cat clinic. Our vet refused to declaw.

80589	0	a	You can just trim their nails as you would a dog. But yeah, declawing is a major operation and it's purely for human selfishness and unwillingness to adapt to the animals needs. I also knew a woman who cut her cats whiskers off to stop it roaming too far from home, this is also highly abusive to the animal and reduces its awareness of its surroundings.  In short, read up about any animal you want as a pet, they all have individual needs.

80600	0	a	When I was younger, probably 12 or 13, I was visiting my cousins who lived in a wooded area. There was a path that looped through the woods and led back to their yard that I thought I knew pretty well. I left the path at one point to go check out a creek nearby. I followed the creek a little bit and after a little while of meandering I quickly realized I had not been paying attention at all. I followed the creek back but couldn't remember where exactly I met up with it to find the path again. I started to panic a bit and tried to get my bearings. I was affraid to start walking unsure of weather or not it was in the right direction so I kind of just sat there for a bit trying to figure it out, with no real hopes of doing so. It was a little while later my cousins Golden came plowing through the trees towards me. Scared the absolute shit out of me at first cuz I didn't know what in the fuck was charging me at the moment. But it was just Ricky the golden coming to hang out. I was so relieved when I saw him because I knew it meant I wasn't that far out, and that Ricky could probably bring me home too, and he did. It wasn't anything major at all but I thought it was really cool that if it weren't for that dog I might have been a bit more fucked. Thanks, Ricky!

I was running around the property frantically, shouting for him, begging with God and making all sorts of promises to do *anything* just to get my baby brother back. I tripped and fell to my knees at some point, exhausted, and when I stilled in defeat I suddenly I heard little shouts of ""Momma!"" along with barks, and followed that noise under a fence and a 1/2 mile up the woods, nearly to our neighbor's cow pasture. Turns out all along, our little wiener dog had been following my baby brother and trying to lead him home. I've never felt such relief in my life.

80644	0	a	It actually kind of is a sense they have. [If you're anxious and worried, you probably leave a different kind of scent the dog can smell.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/3545435/The-smell-of-fear-is-real-claim-scientists.html) So if you're close enough for your dog to catch a whiff of your scent, and it smells you're anxious, it will come and find you and make sure you're ok.   Also, just to drop this in the thread, another thing dogs will do by instinct is stay with a piece of clothing if they end up actually losing you. If you lose your dog somewhere in the woods or a hike somewhere and can't find them for hours (And it's smart. We all know there are some special best friends out there)  go back to the spot you first lost them and leave a jacket or shirt or socks or something of yours on the ground nearby. Come back the next morning and surprise, your pupper will be sleeping on what you left because they think you will come back for it. Which is completely wrong of course, because you're obviously only coming back for them.   That a trick hunters taught me, and it worked for my cousin when she was freaking out on facebook in the woods after her dog chased a deer. She left her jacket and went to keep looking, came back an hour or two later and the dog was hanging out right by it.

80656	0	a	You know it seems like a lot of laws like these cane about as a result of lack of technology. Then enough time goes on and people forget while things around them improve. The resist the change because they forget why they originally created things and “that’s the way it’s always been”.   This feels like a law that was created in a time where it wasn’t very reliable to determine paternity. It’s pretty hard to argue that a child you gave birth to isn’t yours, but the father has no such protection. Thinking about it in this context, I can actually understand why the law may have been created the way it was.   Now obviously I’m on board with changing it because of how much more readily available paternity tests are. I just think people are too quick to bring out the, “How could you possibly think that?!” Outrage mentality. 
80657	0	a	Great to hear politicians are trying to change this. Currently, getting custody for men is mentally and economically so debilitating that dads are afraid to fight back.   r/MensRights and groups have been trying building awareness on this for long.  My friend in New York state who is kind of middle class needed to shell out 80000 in fees to get custody of his daughter even though his wife was suspectedly cheating.

80661	0	a	The logic is usually that the parent(s) doing the majority of the parenting prior to the divorce should be doing the majority of the parenting after the divorce in order to reduce the amount of stress/changes on the kids.  So if parenting prior to the divorce was 50/50 (e.g. feeding, bathing, taking to doctors appointments, etc), it makes sense to continue that arrangement going forward.  But usually women take on a greater share of the day-to-day childcare so that's how it defaults.  Also, it's worth noting that according to PEW, only 4% of fathers seek custody through the legal system, and of those, 1.5% of custody arrangements actually reach a legal verdict.  The majority of the time both parties reach an agreement on their own, or during mediation (with the majority agreeing that the mother gets primary custody).

We recently watched a friend lose all visitation rights in favour of a mother who spent the entire case skirting the edge of contempt of court \*, and had blatantly remarried to a drug dealer.  Some judges are fresh off the Ark.  (\* Not hyperbole.  The judge was constantly warning her, found no evidence for any of her accusations, but ultimately ruled as if they were factual because ""she seemed genuinely upset"".  WTF.  I guess fathers are not vulnerable to these 'emotions', because big boys don't cry.)"
80663	0	a	That's what happened with my parents with my brother and I, here in Michigan. He did everything the judge told both of them to do and she did nothing. He got full custody and she had to pay child support. Fucked up thing was, she never paid a dime and had a warrant out for her arrest. Though, I don't think they ever found her, cause it wasn't dropped until 3 years after her death. That's how I found out she died.   It was a huge shock when we got the news. My dad got the letter about the dropped warrant and was confused as to why. So, he did some digging and found out she died. He ended up buying all three of us her death certificate. Talk about a crazy way to learn about your mother's death. But, it didn't really affect me, cause I really didn't know her. I just knew she didn't love me cause I wasn't a girl. She would baby my older brother and just put me in my crib. My dad had to come home during his lunch breaks to feed me and take care of me along with one of my uncles.  Hell, even when my grandma wanted to hold me, my mom would say she just put me down for a nap. I'd be wide awake laying in my crib and still would say no. I never really understood why it was such a bad thing to her that I was a boy.  The worst about living with my single father is that I don't know how it feels to have a mother. The closest thing I had was my grandmother and she's gone, sadly...  Sorry about the wall, I didn't mean to have such a long reply lol

I'm also unsure what you mean by 'the ex-husband's house'.  If everyone lived there, it's the family home even if the husband was the one paying the bills.  When the deal is one partner works and the other stays home with the kids, you can't then turn around and say ""it's my house, I paid for it"" once that agreement ends.  [Also, it may make you happy to know that when men actually fight for custody, they get it at least 50% of the time.  The issue is that most men don't even ask for it.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_n_1617115)"

The centre was sponsored by Jaguar cars, and the jaguars had their own just-launching X-Type to play with. You approached the building and there was a massive leaping Jaguar symbol, with the Jaguar (cars) logo written on the centre, and large letters saying ""Spirit of the Jaguar"". Inside, an expert on jaguars gave a long, in-depth, informative talk about jaguars and jaguar habitat.  Then came time for the beast itself to be seen. We all went to the observation area and the big cat prowled out. A voice went up from the crowd - ""Look, look! It's a leopard!"".  Sigh."

If animals ""learned"" to recognize plastic sixpack rings as dangerous, this wouldn't be a problem, so making the assumption that they'll ""learn"" the edible ones aren't dangerous isn't logical.   Edit for clarification: a turtle would see no distinction between edible trash and inedible trash; it doesn't even recognize trash as trash. If something appears to have movement, it sees prey or predator. It will not learn that the shape of a sixpack ring equals food, just as turtles have not learned that the plastic they encounter equals not-food."

80726	0	a	I live in this guy's city. I'm seeing a lot of comments saying why didn't he use public transit, get a taxi, ride a bike, or catch a ride with a friend, etc.   Here in Birmingham our public transit is almost non-existent. We have a bus that runs in the daytime to a few stops, and that's it. It doesn't run as early in the morning as he needed, or to the area he needed to go.   The metro Birmngham area isn't bike friendly. He would have had to go through the highway 280 area to get from Homewood to Pelham, which would be suicide on a bike, especially at night. He probably didn't even own a bike, because up until his car had recently broken down, he had a car.   As to why he didn't call a cab or Uber, this guy probably didn't have the money. First of all, he lives in Homewood, which is a very bad part of town, so he's probably poor. Second of all, he was starting a new job, so he hadn't been working. That's probably why he couldn't afford to miss his first day of work and mess it up.   Why didn't he catch a ride? He had to be at work at 4am, first of all. Maybe he didn't have anyone who wanted to wake up at 2:00am and drive him all the way to damn Pelham on short notice. Since he hadn't started that job yet, he didn't know anyone at work he could ask. Since he and his mom had moved from New Orleans, he probably didn't have any family here. Since he lives in Homewood where a lot of people are poor, it's safe to say not all of his friends have cars. The thing is, sometimes on short notice, you just can't always find a ride.   I'm seeing comments from people who think the story doesn't add up. Why is it so hard to believe that someone could have such a work ethic? This guy had lost his home in Hurricane Katrina, so he has probably been through worse shit than having to walk 20 miles. I'd imagine an experience like that would toughen a person up and give them perseverance.   Edit: 3 words for clarity Edit: Let me clear something up about Homewood. There are two parts of Homewood. Because it's right on the edge of Mountain Brook, the rich part of town, there is a nice part of it where rich people live. That area is almost all, if not all, Caucasian. The other side of Homewood is the opposite and has some of the cheapest apartments you can find in the city, almost all African American. More privileged people probably don't even go to that side, so when they think of Homewood they think of the nice part. This guy was going to go work at a moving company, a blue collar job, and didn't have money to rent a car, so safe to say he was not one of the people who could afford to live in the rich part. And because of the difference in parts, if you Google the average house price or income, it's going to be high because the rich people who live on the border of Mountain Brook are going to throw it off. Most of the good part is homes. The bad part is mostly apartments. I've lived in Decatur Georgia and I'm not white so don't assume I'm some racist white person who doesn't know what a bad part of town is. It's not Bessemer or Ensley (which still aren't as bad as Decatur), but if you stay in Alpine apartments, your place is going to get broken into at least once.   Edit again: a lot of people are rightfully pointing out that a lot of rich people also live in Homewood. I'm also going to add that the article said he is a student at Lawson. Anyone who lives in Birmingham knows that it would be highly unusual for an affluent person to go to Lawson. Safe to say he is not one of the rich people living in Homewood if he goes there. He's got to be from the Valley Avenue/Greensprings side of Homewood. Pointing out that there is a rich side of Homewood means nothing when it's obvious by the details of his situation that he would not live there.

80743	0	a	"Your story adds up. I know because my dad dealt with something similar. He's a police officer, over 20 years. He said the single most heart warming call he can remember was a special needs man whose bike was stolen. The whole thing started when he was finishing up a call when an adult special needs man walked up to him holding a broken bike lock and looking devastated.   The man said to my dad, ""They told me at Wal Mart it was supposed to be unbreakable. But someone broke it and stole my bike....""  My dad, at the time, was busy with reports but couldn't turn the guy away. So my dad grabs this guys info and a description of the bike. It was a real tricked out bike too, real unique. Guy had spent some of the little money he had to paint the rims gold and just trick it out as much as he could.   Once the guy tells my dad where the bike was stolen, my dad already had a hunch. He knew of a homeless guy who hung around the area, did enough to stay on the radar but not enough to warrant any real attention.   My dad tells the guy he'll keep an eye out and if he sees the bike, he'll get it back for him. He gives the guy a ride back to his house and heads over to where the homeless guy hung out.   And sure enough, he sees the homeless guy with the bike. So he whips a u turn but the homeless guy saw him and ducked behind a convenience store, then disappears into a trashy motel area. My dad loses the guy but figures he'll see him again.   So the next day, in briefing, my dad lets all the other officers know about the bike and to let him know if they see it.   Later that evening, after the rush hour calls die down, he goes back to where he last saw the homeless guy with the bike. He doesn't see him at first so he swings by a local convenience store for a coffee.....and sure enough, there's the homeless guy with the bike.   My dad goes up to him and asks him where he got the bike....guy gives a spiel about finding it yadda, yadda.   Needless to say, my dad gets the bike back.   Calls up the owner and tells him to meet him at midnight at the same place he first told my dad about the bike  They meet up and my dad's like ""Guess what, I got something for you""  Opens up the back of the car, guy sees the bike, and just lights up with happiness. My dad said he gave him the biggest hug before he starts breaking down in tears.   Turns out, the special needs guy was taking the DART bus from Garland to Carrollton for work. For anyone who knows DFW, that's about a 40 minute drive on the highway. And then would ride his bike from Carrollton back to Garland to go home, usually around midnight after he was off. The DART didn't service the area he worked that late so his bike was the only way he had to get back home. He was worried about his job because his boss didn't like letting him off early enough to catch the DART bus back home.   Long story short, even in major metropolitan areas with extensive public transit, it doesn't always work out for everyone. The man was doing what he needed to do to get to work.  "
80744	0	a	The more i'm exposed to comments like this, the more I think that we're all being fucked by the Just World Fallacy. It's like people don't believe somebody could really have it *that* bad, and if they do, it must be their fault somehow. I think the root of it is the impulse to avoid pain. (The pain comes in admitting that sometimes, life just sucks for some people, and it's unfair.) Empathy is a beautiful thing, but it can be a double-edged sword. 
80745	0	a	I never know if it's non Americans or stupid ones. Either they think everywhere is NYC with subways and busses as far as the eye can see. Or they're moron Americans who have never used public transportation in their life and assume that because they saw a bus once on the way home from work that public transportation must be an option. I live in a relatively large city and yeah we have busses. But they're cash only (exact change too), have no time schedule, and just stop every few miles. I was going to use it to save money, not because I had to. Noped right out of there. If there's a 90% change taking the bus will make you late, it's not an option.

I ran out of money last Thursday, my paycheck was supposed to come Friday, and my boss didn't have it available until today. Yesterday, Sunday, I literally didn't have enough gas to make it from work, to home, and back to work just to pick up my check.  I almost just slept in my car because I didn't want to have to call up a nearby friend, admit all this, and ask him to spend the night at his place. People underestimate exactly how hard it is to admit to people, especially close friends, that your situation is terrible.

80774	0	a	Well that was about 25 years ago. I am doing substantially better. I live in a house and own my truck. :-)  Still pretty poor, but mainly because I work in my areas of passion rather than chasing money. I am in outdoor experience/education leading river trips (canoe/kayak). I work seasonally which gives me time to do long distance hiking and travel.
80775	0	a	In the end he came around and  volunteered to drive  on  field trips. One was for Astronomy (science credit) and the other for Physical Education; white water rafting and overnight observatory in [Goldendale](http://www.goldendaleobservatory.com/), the largest public observatory in the world (at that time). I think he realized how lucky I was to go on field trips that you couldn't take hundreds of students on. The science teacher had one requirement; any student enrolling in his class had to partake in his annual slaughterhouse field trip. My dad didn't drive for that one.

80792	0	a	For those that don't know, the US government offers free programs for destroyed currency, so if your savings get destroyed in a house fire, or your cash unfortunately get shredded by a toddler, or if the bills are just falling apart, you can send the money to the treasury and they will reimburse you for the old bills

80806	0	a	Lack of trust of banks, wanting immediate access, etc.
80807	0	a	It's just $1,000. That's not that ridiculous of an amount to keep in cash.   Edit: Relax people. I know $1,000 is a lot of money for some. I'm not saying it's not. It's still not a ridiculous amount to hold in cash. 
80808	0	a	"The shredder was probably just  left plugged in, which was a mistake. 2 year olds are more than capable of watching their parents do something and then doing it themselves.  The kid watched his parents shred paper and decided ""that looks fun, I want to shred some too!""."

80821	0	a	I don’t know if it’s mentioned in this article , but yesterday I read a story on this where the parents said they’ve been letting the kid help them shred important papers, and that it was an activity he liked doing, so he was kind of trained to shred. 
80822	0	a	this is such a bad idea.  Ive never seen a shredder whose opening was actually smaller than my 2-year-old's fingers.  What are they thinking letting them mess with it? Fingers go in there, theres no treasury service to bring those back.

80840	0	a	Just a quick reminder that the mods on r/gameofthrones deleted all posts even referring to Emilia Clarke's charity for eight straight days because of their petty dislike of r/freefolk. They were knee-capping a charity for the sake of their egos and are *still* lying about it, despite users literally having photographic evidence of their gloating about stopping posts about the charity.

80842	0	a	Never thought I’d see the day when r/freefolk is mentioned on r/upliftingnews
80843	0	a	I work in neurosurgery and aneurysm ruptures are absolutely catastrophic for patients and families. Take a 45 year old in perfect health and 3 months later they are going to spend the rest of their life in a nursing home with round the clock care. Maybe they can say their name or recognize their family, but the worst outcomes cannot. It’s not to say everyone ends up that way, some people walk out completely unscathed but they spend 2 weeks in the surgical intensive care unit and about 3 weeks in the hospital. But of the 4 aneurysm ruptures it our ICU now: 1 is proper fucked, 2 are still in the woods (intubated but no definitive long term damage on imaging) and could go either way, and 1 patient is near the end of the two week danger period and is doing well.  And our outcomes are actually better than the national average.   Shit is scary

80845	0	a	Something else should also be mentioned...  The mods of r/gameofthrones actively and aggressively deleted any and all mentions or topics of this fundraiser on their sub.

80856	0	a	Honestly most of the sub has been pretty clear about appreciating the work and passion of the actors and their work in the show. The hate has mostly been directed to the writers and various statements they made.
80857	0	a	Hope you don‘t take this personal, but I think that this description doesn‘t really do r/freefolk justice.  They were always pretty clear about their criticism and the fact that they were mostly mad at the writers (for obvious reasons). There were some minor jabs against some of the actors who defended season 8 but nothing that was really bad. For a shitposting page (sorry, guys) they were really disciplined and their anger was as targeted as humanly possible. After season 8, I expected things on the internet to get much uglier. I think its great that they are even using their popularity to do something good now. Regarding the first petition, I think it was clear to almost everyone that the goal was not to reshoot season 8, but to give that whole thing a catchy and newsworthy title. I have never seen anyone who took that request serious.
80858	0	a	Most, if not all of the criticisms I’ve seen on /r/freefolk go out of their way to praise the actors for their performances, along with the composer, costume designers, etc. Almost all of the criticism is directed towards the show runners.   In fact, the whole lighting complaint regarding S8E3 is the only non-show runner criticism that comes to mind.
80859	0	a	The hate is being directed mostly at the writers. The actors did the best they could with the shit they were handed.
80860	0	a	Before season 5 aired, the first four episodes leaked. People wanted to discuss them, but r/gameofthrones removed all the posts and started banning indiscriminately any who even referred to the leaks. Their sub is 100% spoiler free and they cited being anti-piracy, which is fair, even if some of their bans were a little draconian. So the people who wanted to discuss the leak created their own subreddit. Unfortunately, some people, many who weren't even affiliated with r/freefolk, began spamming r/gameofthrones with spoilers- which is really shitty. So, the ban happy mods of r/gameofthrones banned all mention of r/freefolk, even permabanning some people who just accidentally referred to the people *called the freefolk in the show*. Since then, they've operated pretty much independently of each other. r/gameofthrones is mainly GOT themed cakes or cosplays or artwork, and r/freefolk is mainly shitposting. But r/gameofthrones mods got worse, sometimes banning people who even criticized the show at all. Most of those critics ended up on r/freefolk, but stayed there, being banned and all. Then after r/freefolk started getting some bad press after complaining about the drop in quality in the show (which even critics agree with), an r/freefolk user, u/elle_ellaria, started a charity drive for Emilia Clarke's charity as a way of saying thank you, and that the criticism of the writing was nothing personal. r/freefolk really stepped up to the plate, and have now donated over $100K. As soon as the charity drive started making headlines, the mods at r/gameofthrones- in a move I cannot and will never understand- banned all mention of Emilia Clarke's charity. And here we are.

80881	0	a	"As far as I can tell, it's a few things:   * The freefolk sub was started a few years back due to what some folks viewed as excessive moderating on the GOT sub. The GOT sub was very stringint on posting possible spoilers, even if they were censored or blacked out. * Freefolk generally became a lot more rowdy-fun with plenty of memes and discussions of the show, critical and positive. GOT mostly became a place for users to share original fanart, themed baked goods, etc, but was overall more ""PC"" and less thought-provoking (at least IMO. I'd go to GOT for a celebration of the fandom and freefolk for dank memes and debate).  * GOT started heavily censoring stuff and eventually removed any cross-links from freefolk. * A user (Elle_Ellaria, I think) posted a link to Emilia Clarke's sponsored charity on freefolk and it took off to the tune of like 45k USD. The user also tried to post it on GOT but it was removed either by strict mods or just caught in a filter, there's still a lot of murkiness there.  * Emilia Clarke posted a thank you video to one of her social media accounts thanking Reddit and freefolk. GOT mods have been either denying they took down the original post or apologizing for not seeing it etc.  * Considering GOT has always turned their nose up a bit at freefolk and GOT had a significantly larger subscriber base until recently (I think freefolk surpassed them or is about equal to them as of S8, but I'm not 100% sure), a lot of freefolk users are happy to rub it in the faces of the mod team of GOT for showing them up.   The tea is spicy between the two subs at the moment. Anyone with more familiarity feel free to correct me, I didn't even know what was up until last night and I'm sure to have gotten some things wrong/biased."
80882	0	a	In all seriousness, it’s not a bad sub and some of the art is pretty amazing. But the mods are the shitty ones that deleted every post that linked to the r/freefolk donation page

To shit on absolutely everything /r/freefolk does, including charity, currently they are minimizing the amount of money raised by saying only .5% of the subs subscriber count has donated. 5000 people donating is still pretty fucking good.

I personally browse freefolk for the memes and asoiaf for serious discussion, although that's mainly become criticism alongside the sharp decline in quality of the show

Their in-game function is to allow capital ships (big expensive ships like carriers, jump freighters, and titans) to jump directly to the cyno from several systems away.  But, they’re often used as a symbolic/memorial gesture.

It was right outside a null station, and the hosting corp had plenty of defenders ready to handle any crashers; but nevertheless, waves of attackers came, killed cynos, got killed in return, and then came back to do it again.

It is typically expressed as an overwhelming emotional response combined with piloerection (goosebumps). Stimuli that produce a response are specific to the individual.  Frisson is of short duration, usually no more than 4–5 seconds, usually pleasurable.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

We ask the guy if they get to take food home, because its all wasted. He said they used to, but people started trying to sue for getting sick so the casinos stopped letting them take it home. Which is sad cause it was a ton of food left every night they just have to throw away. 
80973	0	a	McDonald’s in Argentina kind of does this... upon closing they put all the remaining burgers in a bag of a different color for the homeless to know which one has the food. It’s probably not the best system, but it’s at least better than throwing them away for real.

80976	0	a	Never been homeless, but I have been poor in college. My boy who worked at auntie annes used to mark the trash bag full of the cooked food with a sharpie before he threw it out when he closed up. He also used to double bag it. So grateful.

81002	0	a	Maybe not, apparently Windsor Castle is too valuable to insure, for example. For a place like this its main insurance is more likely to be the fact that it's so important it has government funding for things like this.
81003	0	a	"Governments often self-insure. That is, the government is big enough to pay out for potential losses, so they don't necessarily insure things.  Insurance is really for protecting you against losses that would seriously damage you financially. If the potential losses wouldn't do that, it doesn't make a great deal of sense to pay an insurance company.  ----------  Insurance underwriting basically (in theory) works like: Estimated risk + a profit margin + all of the insurer's overhead. You do not get some ""deal"" from the insurance company unless they screw up estimating the risk.  The French government's budget is ~1.4 trillion Euros, they can afford to rebuild the thing even if it costs an astronomical sum of money.   ----------  I'm sure whatever contractor was working on the thing didn't have a 10 billion euro insurance policy, so the French government is who it'll probably fall to."

81098	0	a	"The Cry of the Owl?  ""1701 it was when gales and storms ""vented their fury unchecked on Romney Marsh,"" a drear gobbet of bogs and drained pastureland in Kent. But to Tamazine , whose sheep rancher father has recently died, the marsh is home. To save the homestead for her flighty mother and sister, Tamazine  agrees to marry a distant cousin, shady Joslan Penrose, who has inherited the farm. It soon becomes obvious to Tamazine , and to the nice clergyman who loves her, that Joslan is a free-wheeling brigand who has thrown in his lot with the local ""owlers""--wool smugglers. But it is also obvious that Tamazine  is inexplicably attracted to Joslan--especially after he breaks his promise of marriage-of-convenience abstinence. And so, in spite of at first working hand and gauntlet with a pursuing Dragoon after the owlers, Tamazine  saves Joslan at the last. A fine flood, muffled threats and nightrides, plus a 20th-century introduction and envoi which posit a century-linking daydream--adding up to a nice little hoot from a comparatively new (Master of Asygarth, 1976) owl in the forest of romance."""

81118	0	a	">It takes empathy and the ability to create a 3rd person perspective in your mind to tell a story coherently, lacking this ability (namely empathy) is a symptom of autism. Otherwise you cant really check yourself and think, ""does this make sense to the other person.""  Just to clear something up in this linked reddit thread: [lack of empathy is ***not*** a symptom of autism](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-with-autism-can-read-emotions-feel-empathy1/). Most autistic individuals experience a 'typical' amount of empathy, in that some will be better or worse than others at empathizing, and the ability to emphasize does not correlate to one being on any point in the spectrum. In fact, for some, the opposite is almost true - they feel *all* the emotions of those around them and it is overwhelming.  Where the break down comes is filtering our own speech, communicating our own reactions back to those around us. We say something 'weird', we feel the discomfort it caused it caused the other person and then spend time mentally chastising ourselves for not anticipating the reaction and so avoiding saying the 'weird' thing^(I am autistic, in case it wasn't obvious at this point).  4chan OP may still be autistic though. Hard to say. "
81119	0	a	Op woke up at noon and didn't have a shower. But he had to take the water weight test.  His sister didn't shower either but she wore tight pants and a sports bra and did the thing the girls do at the ymca where they put their hair up but dont.  What's not to get?   He has 3 bedrooms    
81120	0	a	After reading many many comments, the (assumed and unsure) consensus is that OP’s mom made him go to the doctor to try a new method of weight measurement, on his day off from school. He was made more upset when his sister ended up enjoying it. The body suit made him uncomfortable, while his sister got to wear a sports bra, which must’ve been more comfortable.  That seems to be the best guess but goddamn if my head doesn’t hurt.
81121	0	a	The shower OP skipped did not take place around noon. So did his sister's. Seems pretty clear to me.

My mate shouted to the band between songs that it was my birthday and they should sing happy birthday to me, they did, and got my name wrong, i don't know how I expected them to know it though.  After this my mate then lifted me up to the stage and i got on stage, I only barely remember this, and was dancing behind the lead singer with some others from the crowd. Apparently I knocked over the singer's mic and he wasn't happy, again I don't remember that bit, but i got a signed ticket from the rest of the band after and they recognised me as the really drunk guy. I still have the signed ticket.   Good Times.

They describe the visualization as such:  > This animation shows the evolving distribution of 12-month average temperature anomalies across the surface the Earth from 1850 to present. Anomalies are measured with respect to 1951 to 1980 averages. The red vertical line shows the global mean, and matches the red trace in the upper-left corner. The data is from Berkeley Earth and the animation was prepared with Matlab.  As for why the 1951 to 1980 averages were chosen as a baseline:  > A baseline of 1951 to 1980 is one of the common choices in climatology. By WMO convention, climatologies are always based on at least 30-year averages. Any choice of a reference period is going to be somewhat arbitrary, and will often reflect the goals of how it is to be used. Often, when talking about climate change, you want a baseline that is far enough in the past that you can meaningfully show changes, but not so long ago that you will start having large uncertainties about what the baseline average actually was.  > When discussing local changes, the 1950s is the earliest decade that allows you to be more-or-less globally complete. The 1950s was the period when humanity first created permanent bases in Antarctica. Any earlier than the 1950s and you are going to have trouble defining what the reference temperature for Antarctica actually was, which makes it impractical for a local baseline.  > It probably isn't obvious from the animation, but prior to the 1950s the global reconstructions have gaps in Antartica (and other places as one goes even earlier). As a result the distribution shown in the animation actually sums to somewhat less than 100% of Earth's surface prior to the 1950s.

This means you could cut a unit-square-sized hole through a real unit cube and still have material holding it together.

81325	0	a	Somehow this looks even more infuriating from above than it feels to be stuck in one.
81326	0	a	Often caused by someone trying to change lanes.
81327	0	a	As someone who drove hundreds of thousands of miles as a service technician, I would always try to alleviate traffic by driving at a slow speed without touching my brake lights.   If I could stay at a steady speed, I theorized that unless someone else behind me screwed up I could reduce the possibility of this shockwave.
81328	0	a	That’s why you keep a constant distance from the car in front and drive at the speed of traffic
81329	0	a	You can help alleviate this problem by *leaving room in front of your car.* It makes it so people can change lanes without you having to hit your brakes and also gives you enough space so that if someone in front of you hits their brakes, you can keep coasting. If every car just allowed more space on the road instead of riding each other's bumpers, it would help issues like this a ton.
81330	0	a	imagine if people didnt drive like morons
81331	0	a	this is one of the issues that self-driving cars would fix... traffic jams would be non-existent
81332	0	a	I ride 66 to and from work every day in northern VA and these mini shock waves happen for basically the entirety of my 20 mile commute. It drives me nuts when i think about this gif when I'm sitting in that traffic.
81333	0	a	Yep. People really don’t understand how far back that effect goes. Then if multiple instances coincide, even more people try to change lanes because they think their lane is slowing down and don’t realize it’ll work itself out in a second if everyone stays put. Then suddenly you have a spontaneous traffic jam that doesn’t even involve a backed-up off ramp or an accident or anything.
81334	0	a	I think there was a study about this that determined exactly what you hypothesised. Keeping distance and not breaking does solve this problem.   Now if only they told you this in driver's education
81335	0	a	I saw a youtube video where a guy claimed he could solve any  traffic jam by doing this.  I try real hard not to hit my brakes in traffic.
81336	0	a	But that's far too reasonable
81337	0	a	In certain parts of L.A. they would call a person like you a sucker as car after car squeezes into that constant distance you are trying to keep and the cars behind you honk.
81338	0	a	Self driving cars, man. They be comin'. God damn I'm looking forward to leaning back all the way to the destination.  Could you imagine synchronizing that stuff? Cars communicating - default speed at 100 mph.
81339	0	a	That said, it would also help if people allowed each other to change lanes.  When I'm in a traffic jam, I always try to be courteous because it's the quickest way out of the jam.  I must admit that's hard when the other guy is acting like a jerk, but it's really in my self interest.
81340	0	a	The brakes really get me. If you're driving properly the only reason you need to use your brakes on the highway is an emergency.
81341	0	a	Imagine every single car talking to each other so they can thread the needle on intersections without having to stop.
81342	0	a	"Nobody should ""allow"" you to change lanes, but they shouldn't drive in a way that would keep you from changing lanes in the first place. Leave room, people!"
81343	0	a	Yeah, like those games where you try to get that car out of a garage by moving other cars around, solved by a computer at several gigahertz
81344	0	a	This is the other thing. Leaving the appropriate amount of room between you and the car in front of you means that if someone does change lanes and gets in front of you, you can slow down a minimal amount for a minimal distance while still driving safely. But people act like the distance they follow at 70mph is supposed to be the same as the distance they follow at 25mph, so when someone merges in front of them they have to slow way down.
81345	0	a	I need a subreddit just for all things microscopic...
81346	0	a	**Explanation** ---  This video shows a nice visualization of the transition from the nanoscale to the visible scale. It also visualizes different techniques used to write and see very small features. The following steps were used to write the features:  1. The first images you see with the Molecular Foundry logo, have features only a few tens of nanometers in width. That's on the order of a few hundred atoms. In order to get features this small, a high energy electron beam was used to hit atoms in a very precise way, resulting in the tiny grooves you see.^(*)  2. Next, you see a time lapse of the Berkeley Logo written using a different technique called [focused ion beam milling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focused_ion_beam). In this case gallium ions were smashed into the coin, [as shown in this diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Principe_FIB.jpg). Eventually this method traced out the Berkeley Logo.  3. Finally a simple optical microscope puts the other two images in context by showing how small of an area they occupy in the coin.  \* From the source I can't quite be sure if they stripped atom directly using the electron beam or if they used the beam to strip away a resist and then etched the surface as in [electron beam lithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron-beam_lithography)  ___ **Video Source:** [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oES1gpvT0I)

81363	0	a	Could have been many reasons. If they can’t obey orders perfectly, if they get distracted to easily, if they can’t behave near other dogs, if they’re two nice and playful, if they’re two mean and aggressive, if a mistake by their trainer was made midway or late during their training that might comprise them, if they were exposed to actual drugs and risked smell desensitization, etc. All these reasons can get a dog kicked to the curb from training. Besides how labor and expertise intensive their training is, the strict requirements to pass is what makes trained dogs, in any capacity, very expensive.  Edit: They’res’ you’re ‘to’ correction ya bastards.

It was highly unpleasant.  I rolled the dice and let them open it. My friend had sent our camp a bunch of trader Joe's candy, chocolate covered espresso beans, and some moldy blueberry muffins.

My buddy had some herb in his backpack. We saw a k-9 unit up ahead on the street, and we all sorta paused. Well, two of us did. The guy with the backpack walked right up to the dog. My other friend and I were staring, wide-eyed, at the situation. We were certain he was about to get busted. But as soon as he got to the dog, he bends down and starts playing with the dog. Like really playing with it like they were old friends. He got down in the dog's face and starts doing that ""Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?"" stuff and petting it all over. The dog, of course starts freaking out and jumping all over him because that's what it's trained to do.  The officer in charge of the dog had his back to him, and when he felt the leash tug, he turned around to see it jumping all over a member of the public and immediately starts admonishing it, telling the dog to get down and stop. The dog wouldn't calm down, so the cop eventually put him back in the squad car, looking very concerned at his dog's behavior. Then he turns to my buddy and tells him that he's not supposed to play with police dogs. Buddy apologizes and says he just loves dogs and he seemed really friendly.  After a few seconds we catch back up to our buddy down the block with our jaws hanging open. Instant legend. It's still one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in person."

It's conserved, meaning that it's a quantity that, if there is no outside influence, will stay the same for any object.   Since the mass of the sphere stays the same, and the radius of the sphere is decreased, the rotational velocity has no choice but to increase in order for the angular momentum to stay constant.

81438	0	a	I think the key piece of information you need that isn't obvious in this is that the blue gears aren't actually tied to the teal colored shaft normally, they're on ball bearings and spin freely when the collars (pink) aren't engaged to them.
81439	0	a	The engine is turning the green crank shaft at the top, that is turning the red shaft on the right which is then turning the blue gears in the transmission. Because of their different sizes, the gears turn at different speeds or rpm(rotations per minute). Those are positioned on the real drive shaft, which turns the axle and wheels, but they are not connected to the drive shaft so they spin seperately from it.   The pink gears are connected to the drive shaft, so when one of them engages with one of the gears being turned by the red crank shaft, it turns the teal drive shaft at that rpm.  When in 4th gear, the green drive shaft is engaged directly with the teal drive shaft so they are spinning at the same rpm.   There is also an extra orange gear that pops into place between the red shaft and the drive shaft gears when you put it in reverse so that it reverses the direction of rotation.   Edit, format, colors, typos etc
81440	0	a	r/restofthefuckingowl
81441	0	a	How did you get by in the meantime?
81442	0	a	Nah, automatic gear boxes are black magic that use unnatural powers and sorcery (and nested planetary gear sets).  Motor cycle gear boxes are neat though.
81443	0	a	Green shaft is the input shaft, coming from the engine. It's connected to the red lay shaft so they both spin as long as power is coming from the engine (ie the clutch pedal isn't depressed). The blue gears all constantly receive power from the the red shaft so they spin too, but they're on bearings so they can just rotate freely. Since the ratio between the blue gears and the corresponding gears on the red shaft are all different each blue gear spins at a different rate, giving different transmission speeds. When you move the gear selector you cause one of the pink shift collars to engage with one of the blue gears. The pink collars are all splined to the teal output shaft (note the grooves visible in the diagram) so when one of them engages with a gear it causes power to be transmitted from the input shaft, to the lay shaft, along to the appropriate gear, and from there to the output shaft via the shift collar. Reverse is a bit different because it has the orange idler gear, which slides in between the gear on the red shaft and it's counterpart on the teal shaft. Adding a third gear changes the direction of the teal gear's rotation, which means the car goes backward.  The equations are calculating gear ratio, which is basically the ratio between how fast the input and output shafts turn. Higher ratios provide more torque at the cost of lower top speed. In first gear the ratio is 4.125:1, meaning the input shaft turns 4.125 times for every 1 turn of the output shaft, which delivers the power needed to get the wheels turning from a standstill but doesn't let you go very fast. The ratios get progressively smaller up to 4th gear which is 1:1 or direct drive, so the input and output shafts spin at the same speed. 5th is an overdrive gear, meaning the output shaft actually spins faster than the input shaft; this allows for better efficiency but means there's not a lot of power available, so it's usually reserved for highway cruising. Most transmissions have a gear that is at or very close to a 1:1 ratio, as well as an overdrive.

81446	0	a	If you already know how something works then you’re not equipped to say whether it demonstrates it. Your brain will make connections seemingly obvious to you, that others simply aren’t equipped to know. It’s the same reason every writer needs an editor, to tell them when the thing they think is obvious isn’t coming across clearly (and a bunch of other reasons, of course). I, for instance, drive a stickshift, and I’m in the same spot as the person you’re responding to. I basically got how the stick’s movement engaged the different gears, but that gives me zero comprehension of how that modulates speed/revolutions of the engine.

The small oil droplets burn in the air. There’s more burnable surface area on the fountain of oil drops in the air than there is on the pre-water surface of the pot, so the fountain burns like a motherfucker!

Don’t use foam fire extinguishers as they contain more water than foam.  —————————  Original post:  Seeing as nobody has mentioned this yet, the safe(r) way to put out a grease fire is throwing a damp cloth/towel over the whole thing to starve it of oxygen.

81467	0	a	Story time folks:  Several years ago, this happened to me and my sister. We were in my dad’s apartment and we were fending for ourselves while he was at work. (We were between the ages of 18-20 at the time.)   She was frying pork chops are something and then I hear her call for my help. I casually walk over to the kitchen and see about a small fire burning on the stove.   “Oh shit!” I think to myself. “We need to smother this.” I start looking for a pot lid or something to cover up the pan.   Well as I’m failing my investigation check, my sister has filled a small Tupperware container with water. The next moment happens in the slow motion for me. I watch with pure terror as her extends her arm and flicks the contents of the container onto the fire.  You guessed it folks, the above gif is precisely what happened to my father’s kitchen.   I vividly remember standing and staring as the flames began to climb up the walls and across the ceiling. I honestly don’t know how or why the flames just abruptly stopped burning but they did. Thankfully no one was hurt.   My sister learned a valuable lesson that day about oil, water and grease fires. And we also learned that Mr.Clean magic erasers do a fairly good job of cleaning up the charred evidence of our fuck up as we proceeded to scrub down the kitchen walls.   TL;DR - My sister is no chemist and set fire to my dad’s kitchen via this method. 
81468	0	a	"I had a head chef do this once. He carried the buttery pot over to the dish tank slid it in the corner and hit it with a sprayer. A six foot, flame rocket out of the pot to the ceiling and took a 90 degree angle and started launching across the ceiling. We both went ""oh shit!"" He then walked over and put the lid on the pot ( what you're supposed to do, its smothers out the fire) and said ""Well that was stupid."" And we got on with our lives.  "
81469	0	a	"I saw a slow mo of what happens, the water boils(maybe flash boils) and forces the hot oil out of the pan and into the flame coming out of the stove, then the oil basically explodes for a lack of a better word.  Update: So, here is more accurate explanation of of what happens  from u/MultiFazed  Oil burns at much, much higher temperatures than water boils. And oil floats on top of water.  So when you throw water onto a grease fire, the water sinks below the oil and is flash-boiled to steam by the intense heat, which blows the oil out like a small explosion. This causes the oil to break into thousands of tiny droplets. All those droplets have a lot more surface area than the original pool of oil, allowing the oil to mix with oxygen at a greatly-increased rate, which speeds up the combustion of the oil so much that it transitions from ""on fire"" to ""exploding"" (this is the same general reason why a pile of sawdust is perfectly safe, and you could put a cigarette out in it, but a large cloud of sawdust in the air is an explosion hazard).  So the end result of throwing water on oil is a giant fireball of flaming oil droplets that will probably set your house on fire."

Plenty of rural spots mixed in between those areas too.  Research Triangle Park is somewhat centralized, but its spread out over 7,000 acres.  The amount of stop changes that would be necessary would be staggering and the commutes would be lengthened greatly.  It's just not feasible in many metro areas in the US.  Large cities, yes.

It's no coincidence people don't often ride public transit in these areas.  In dense cities, space becomes a major constraint, and it's no coincidence public transit is the best option. That's basically exactly what this .gif is trying to illustrate.
81506	0	a	> many cities in the US are not designed like cities in US  I thought so.
81507	0	a	During rush hours transports are packed, but 99% of cars are just the driver.
81508	0	a	What you're describing sounds like a horribly incompetent bus system.  A good one takes 30 minutes and departs every 15... while still sharing the road with other traffic. So consider something rail-based, and you'll get there in 15.
81509	0	a	That's because washing your ass crack is gay and I ain't gay
81510	0	a	In the US people with money all buy cars and commute into the city. So the population using the public transportation is lower class. Then the transportation network carries [blank] number of passengers and scales back to meet that demand. Suddenly you have a bus full of dirty people. No corporate workers want to get on it, and the cycle is perpetuated.  I've been on public transportation in Europe and it's outstanding. You just have to get everyone to use it. It's like a social network. But if you had tire and car companies conspiring to stop the social network from functioning.
81511	0	a	##Induced demand Induced demand, or latent demand, is the phenomenon that after supply increases, more of a good is consumed. This is entirely consistent with the economic theory of supply and demand; however, this idea has become important in the debate over the expansion of transportation systems, and is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity as a cure for congestion. This phenomenon, called induced traffic, is a contributing factor to urban sprawl.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove
81512	0	a	"> Yep, thanks to induced demand  I call this the ""bigger desk paradox"". You get a bigger desk because your current one has no space on it, and within a week the new one has no space on it either."
81513	0	a	Correct. In the case of congestion here are the main reasons widening roads and expanding public transit doesn't work:  * Many drivers who formerly used alternative routes during peak hours switch to the improved expressway (spatial convergence);  * Many drivers who formerly traveled just before or after the peak hours start travelling during those hours (time convergence); and  * Some commuters who used to take public transportation during peak hours now switch to driving, since it has become faster (modal convergence).  The issue of traffic congestion is a simple issue of supply and demand. Roads are in limited supply, yet since they are free the demand on their use is also high. The simple way to fix this is to increase the cost of using the road until supply and demand find an equilibrium. Increasing supply on a free product will only further increase demand.  This is where the idea of [congestion pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing) comes into play. The idea is simple really:  * The more congested the road is the more you charge to use it. When it's empty it's free when it's bumper to bumper you pay max.
81514	0	a	Yeah the problem with the US is that most people who work in cities don't live *in* the cities, they commute there every day so biking to work would be near impossible.

81519	0	a	I know no one likes this idea but I feel like it's unarguably the best solution**:**  Get rid of cars completely in densely populated cities. Eventually, with self driving vehicles, public/shared transit will be incredibly efficient and reduce pollution tremendously.  Issues like people not knowing how to drive, or the loss of jobs can be easily remedied, make learning how to drive a requirement for graduating high school and making a free program to show them how to drive available to ALL people. (Obviously an area to learn how to drive would be on the edge of the city.)  The loss of mechanical jobs or building cars would be partially replaced with making buses/trains/rails and maintaining them, and you could even add security guards to public transit helping make public transit safer while creating jobs.  Obviously some important personal vehicles will be allowed for ambulances, police, ~~pizza deliveries~~, out of state truck drivers, etc.  Some common replies I get to posting this idea is that there aren't enough buses for everyone, or that buses don't run near them. If we got rid of cars we would have to create more buses and extend their routes.  One issue I do see is the difficulty of grocery shopping, you wouldn't be able to buy a weeks worth of food and then rid the bus. I gots no real solution to this.  Edit: ; -> :  2: Pizza comment was an attempt at a joke.  3: This is all easier said than done, but that does not mean we should not consider it.

81530	0	a	The original French lead engineer was the same guy who did the Suez Canal which was dredged to sea level and doesn't require these locks to raise the vessel. For the Panama, it just wasn't feasible though because of the heavy rain and jungle in the area, and like most things back in those days, a lot of people died building it.   Another fun fact: the USA secured a 100 year lease on the canal. Jimmy Carter gave Panama ownership in 1977 in a treaty that required the canal always be neutral.

81540	0	a	This makes me wonder - are ships constrained to their current widths *because* of the Panama Canal? Like, surely we can go bigger (Oil tankers, etc), but for shipping container vessels, the extra trip around South America probably isn't worth the trade off for a bigger ship that can fit more cargo? ...or something?  Edit: A quick Google search makes it seem like it's in fact the opposite, that the canal is adjusting to the newer sizes of ships: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal_expansion_project

81542	0	a	"i remember talking about the cost analysis of the panama canal in grad school and sometime in 2050-70 it's going to be cheaper to dredge it to sea level than continue operating the levee/pump system. It's not cheap to constantly be raising and water like that, and building technology is a lot cheaper than it was in 1904. Panama Canal was the most expensive construction project in the history of the US at the time. The idea is already being floated around, it's called ""The New Panama Canal"", would likely cost 3.5-5 Billion, original canal cost $352 million in 1904 which is like 9-10 billion today.   "

81547	0	a	It takes a while. I sailed through in a sailboat once, and it took two days. The first day we went through the locks to get up into lake Gatun, and then we docked there on some bouys for the night. The next morning we sailed to the other locks, and went down to the pacific.  It was a really cool experience.   Some container ships and other commercial traffic go straight through and don’t have to spend the night in lake Gatun though.

81586	0	a	There's a penis joke in there somewhere. 
81587	0	a	If I recall correctly, it's because of the way it attaches itself to a host. The design actually makes a lot of sense from an evolutionary standpoint. And as small as these things are, prions are even smaller.  Here's why:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3ATevenphage.svg  It stores the DNA in the upper part, the lower part acts basically as a claw to grab on the host. The long body acts like a syringe so latch on, then bear down and inject its DNA into the host. From what I was reading, the life cycle of these things is like 10 minutes.
81588	0	a	Universe is 8.8x10 to the 26th power meters across. Planck length is 1.6x10 to the -35th power meters. Considering the average adult is 1.7m, we are definitely closer to the size of the universe than to a Planck unit.
81589	0	a	RNA actually, which then replicates DNA insde the host. It's a virus that infects a bacterium, in turn infecting a host. The reason it looks so complex at such a small size is due to the relatively low amount of genetic information passed along by the single stranded RNA. There is a debate among scientists as to is viruses are actually alive becuase they cannot survive outside a host and their only purpose is to infect and move on. Another crazy thing to look up is that humans carry a lot of viral DNA in our genetic code, reminants of the past 100k years of evolution and epigenetic events due to viral infection. Blows my mind.   Edit: was corrected about part of my statement. See below. 
81590	0	a	"Viruses are widely considered to be nonliving organic constructs, mainly because they lack metabolic potential (cannot generate their own energy) and they cannot replicate without hijacking a host cells machinery.  But what is ""alive"" anyway? All living things are comprised of nonliving basic components. Its the interactions between those nonliving components that culminate into a living thing. Viruses blur that line. "

The thing is, instead of a punch from a pizza maker, the force that made the Milky Way wobble was probably a smaller galaxy falling into it. That wobble will continue to propagate through and across the Milky Way, because there’s not a lot of friction between the particles that make it up, so the damping is quite negligible.

This is the wonderful work of 1ucasvb, who makes some of the best visual explanations for quite abstract mathematical and physical concepts such as [3D space-time warping](https://1ucasvb.tumblr.com/post/142605511227/in-einsteins-general-theory-of-relativity-space), [π vs τ](https://1ucasvb.tumblr.com/post/90194183753/what-are-your-thoughts-on-the-pi-v-tau-debate), [affine transformations](https://1ucasvb.tumblr.com/post/90187846623/affine-transformations-preserve-parallel-lines) or [the Fourier transform](https://1ucasvb.tumblr.com/post/44489240563/the-continuous-fourier-transform-takes-an-input?is_related_post=1), to name a few.  Please go check his awesome work and next time credit properly. Have a nice day!

81617	0	a	Same but with geometry. Turns out I was more of a statistics kinda girl.
81618	0	a	Exactly. I was hearing some things, like radians, and had no clear understanding of what it is, how and why it is an angle measurment... Rare are times when they explain it simply for everybody to understand.

81620	0	a	I was good with geometry, and aced stats, but calculus might as well have been advanced quantum theory.
81621	0	a	that's because most math teachers (at least in the US, in highschools) aren't mathematicians and likely don't have the rigorous math foundation of the higher maths or intuitive understanding of it themselves ... and then most math professors at the University level aren't taught *how* to teach. They're researchers.
81622	0	a	How manhole covers are 'SUPPOSED' to be replaced.  This technique must not be used in my town.
81623	0	a	Why do they need to remove the asphalt around the old manhole?  Also old manhole sounds dirty. 
81624	0	a	Come on, you know any city worker or contractor is not putting in this kind of effort. And I love how they just dump the old asphalt down the hole. Real nice. 
81625	0	a	Interesting! I've got lots of new manhole covers replaced near me in this fashion. Except they didn't do the last step of leveling it :/   Pretty much have to dodge around them when on my motorcycle. When I do, I pretend I'm one of those super bike racers doing crazy manuevers and it brightens my day just a little. So I guess it's not all bad. 
81626	0	a	They definitely do not perform those last few steps where I live.  The severe decline in quality of roadwork over the last decade or two really makes me sad.
81627	0	a	They forgot to show the 6 dudes watching them work.
81628	0	a	They forgot to mention that it takes 3 weeks and is done in only peak hours of traffic
81629	0	a	Yeah they just build up the new road around it and leave what's essentially a man-made pothole... 
81630	0	a	Totally agree. All our man holes near Toronto are about 3 inches lower than road surface. Drivers are constantly swerving to avoid them to save their car suspension
81631	0	a	New England plan for manhole replacement:  1. Dig out asphalt around manhole. 2. Leave current manhole cover alone. 3. Sharpen edges of the new pothole.  See? We replaced the manhole... with a pothole. Job well done. 
81632	0	a	 >old manhole sounds dirty.    They probably are dirty
81633	0	a	They are upgrading them and the newer ones are larger.
81634	0	a	 I work for an excavation company so I can help answer you. Typically, a Manhole consists of three components: the concrete base and sections, the frame (part the the cover fits into), and the cover (lid) [Image](https://ecode360.com/attachment/FA3294/FA3294-410o%20Pre-Cast%20Manhole%20With%20Pre-Cast%20Base%20and%20Invert%20Drawing%20No%2013.tif.png). This looks like an ad for a specific company for their frame and covers, but typically you'd only remove the asphalt if the asphalt itself has been damaged and you need to repour asphalt to seat the frame (so that shit don't move).   Fun fact: towards the end, the guy with the watering pot is spraying diesel, not water. makes it so the hot asphalt doesn't stick to the plate whacker.
81635	0	a	They've put in [a plug](https://i.imgur.com/q4DVCKi.gifv) beforehand

The cones that were there are just gone now, because people are so used to bullshit Bham roads, they've just been driving over it.

81673	0	a	"Okay I recent visited Hawaii, and I had made it a goal of mine to find a coconut to husk. I had really wanted to find one ever since seeing a dude eat a coconut sprout in Thailand. Apparently the insides of the coconut turn to a sponge cake when they start to sprout. Anyways, I wasn't able to find a sprouted one, but I did find an unhusked brown coconut like the ones in this video. And I'll have you know I had already known of this method to opening the coconut seen in the video, and even using this it took me 10 *#solid* minutes of struggling to rip the husk off the coconut. I mean I'm only 5'11"" and 140lbs, but damn to see this dude open one with his teeth in seconds was very impressive"

81687	0	a	>140lbs  Well, that's why
81688	0	a	Funny thing is, when they're brown like the one in the gif, the coconut water isn't all that great. The meat is good for cooking and whatnot. But if you really want good, sweet coconut water, you get the coconuts when they're still green. And you don't bother husking them, you just chop a hole in the top and drink it. Then you cut yourself a spoon shaped slice off the side, split the thing in half, and scoop out the meat, which is more like a jello consistency at this stage, but very sweet and very tasty. This brown coconut he uses on the video ain't very tasty.   Source: Lived in the Carribean (Trinidad) for a few years. Also saw this guy in Hawaii when we were there.   Edit: it's water not milk    
81689	0	a	It's definitely bad for your teeth. That's why humans invented tools.

81723	0	a	Semi requires the trigger to be pulled each time you want to fire the weapon. Fully automatic allows a continuous stream of fire as long as the  trigger is held down. 
81724	0	a	Thanks, will give it a try next time I’m on desktop, but right-clicking isn’t really the easiest thing on mobile
81725	0	a	What about fully manual guns? How do they work?
81726	0	a	You gotta have a secondary trigger for the clutch. Not very popular nowadays unfortunately.
81727	0	a	Manual would be like a bolt action rifle or a shotgun, every time you fire you have to eject the spent casing and load the next round yourself by performing some seperate action.
81728	0	a	what's interesting is, i'm 51 years old. up until i started seeing threads like this, i assumed everyone understood all these things about guns.  Growing up in Montana, where everyone in my family hunted deer, elk, bear and sometime antelope we all got our hunter license at 14 after taking hunter's safety, and we knew how guns worked and fired by 12 because our dads took us target shooting early to get us familiar.  I had no idea how uncommon that apparently is. so it's strange when i see all these people reading for the first time how all of this works. The first time I saw it i was floored  It's as interesting to me to read people learning these things as it probably is for the people to learn them
81729	0	a	you mention a second trigger for the clutch and I genuinely don't know if you're taking the piss or not  i know nothing about guns either
81730	0	a	"WW1 shotguns could almost work like semi automatics. You keep your finger on the trigger and each time you pump it releases a shell.

81738	0	a	At some point, if I remember my SCUBA training correctly, oxygen becomes toxic at about 200 feet (I did an extensive and exhausting 12 second Google search but couldn’t find a site source for this) and divers have to switch to breathing an oxygen / gas combination (I think it’s helium) in order to survive. That, and the fact that the lower you go puts more pressure on your system than you can possibly imagine and you could *literally explode* if you come up too fast, coupled with [these motherfuckers](https://list25.com/25-most-terrifying-deep-sea-creatures/) will keep my ass just below the surface at all times.

It was Piccard and Walsh that had the window crack, but they didn't know it was cracked until they landed at the sea floor and looked for the source of the noise. They heard a noise but nothing seemed wrong, so they kept going until they reached the sea floor  Cameron stopped due to a hydraulic leak, which affected the robotic arm he wanted to use to grab samples. Then he lost control of some thrusters and could only spin around in circles, so he cancelled the dive early.

81754	0	a	Because it's HELLA expensive to do another dive that deep - Oxygen tanks need to be refilled, the whole sub needs to be checked and fixed for any microfine cracks, you need to rent the boat for another day.

Of course, they aren't using the new synthetic compound because they are concerned about the horseshoe crab. They are doing it because they are concerned about putting time, money and resources into something that may not be reliable. They know if the horseshoe crab reaches the endangered status their access to it will be extremely limited. So it makes more sense to invest in something synthetic.    https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/blood-in-the-water/559229/

81781	0	a	How strong are these ~~repaired implants~~ bonded restorations? Would the person have to focus on not eating hard foods?  edit- thanks for all the replies I've gotten, lots of interesting stories.
81782	0	a	I'm a dentist. I will describe what is going on here.   Purple is a rubber dam. It is used to isolate the teeth. Which means your spit and tongue can't get to the tooth.   He uses a diamond but to roughen everything up a bit so that the filling will stick to the tooth better.   Blue stuff is phosphoric acid to etch the teeth which allows the bond agent to flow into the tooth a little better.   Next stuff is the bond agent which is thinned with air then cured with blue light. This is the stuff that really makes the filling stick to the tooth.   He then uses a matrix to make a lingual shell for the filling. The matrix is made by taking an impression beforehand and recreating the shape you want on the tooth in wax then using a putty that hardens to take another impression and make a matrix.   He then uses composites of different translucency to recreate the tooth. Dentin is more opaque and enamel is more translucent.   Or you can do a crown
81783	0	a	I've had this on two of my teeth. This is the correct way. I've had a dentist just make it back into a tooth shape, and had one who took tons of time adding groves and making it look real. I don't go to the first dentist anymore. 
81784	0	a	My dentist has these rubber blobs that you put between your teeth so you can relax your muscles while he works on your teeth, they're pretty neat. 
81785	0	a	I also had this done. It's about maybe 20-30 minutes of work. You get rubber blocks to prop your mouth open and allow you to relax. Wasn't that bad, and it's easier, knowing your fucked up tooth is being fixed.
81786	0	a	Some dentists do use a rubber dam (which is what that purple thing is) to isolate the teeth from the rest of the mouth so the procedure isn't contaminated by saliva; needs to have a dry working environment.   Source: in dental school 
81787	0	a	How the hell did I not notice the gums were purple before you said that?
81788	0	a	I chipped mine in the same place about 20 years ago. The cap fell off about 3 times since then. The first time from really cold water (?) and another time from biting into a rib. This last one has been about 10 years going strong. It seemed to really have depended on the dentist that did it. Not sure how long they are supposed to last but gives you some context. 
81789	0	a	They’re called Bite blocks. Dentists love them even more than you do cause we don’t have to tell you to open every few minutes. Plus they decrease the stress in your jaw joint.

81792	0	a	Honestly my dentist has used those on me and at one point I felt like my jaw was gonna dislocate. 
81793	0	a	Depends if you're in a country that has free healthcare or if you are in a country where you have to sell your house to get treatment.
81794	0	a	I have a chipped front tooth that I've never gotten repaired. It's considered cosmetic so my dental insurance won't cover it. Last time I asked I think they said $3000 for a veneer.  They do plastic bonding like in this gif for cheaper, but you have to get it redone every few years and it comes out more expensive in the long run.
81795	0	a	Don't worry, once you're done you get to stare into people's rotting mouth holes for the rest of your life.  But there is all that money, so it works out.
81796	0	a	Ah man yeah that reminds me I had an infected root a few years ago and they took pictures and 3d printed me a new tooth in the office on the spot. Took a few hours but man was amazing. Science is OK. 
81797	0	a	Definitely a preference issue. They also come in sizes so you might have a narrow opening in your jaw and they tried jamming it open with it. It’s not supposed to be a wedge or a jack motion. More of a “pillow” to rest your jaw against (meaning it should be passive against your jaw. Not actively forcing it open).

81836	0	a	**Explanation** ---  The experiment shown here was carried out on the International Space Station to see how combustion happens in a 0g environment. They used a 50/50 fuel mixture of iso-octane and heptane, tested in a standard air environment (21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen at 1 atm). The results are quite interesting. The only glaringly obvious feature is that the flame looks spherical. The reason for that is simply that it has no reason to look otherwise. On Earth, gravity creates an axis that defines the direction of convection (i.e. up). In contrast, in the case of micro-gravity there is no up and gases diffuse with a spherical symmetry. An additional feature that is important is that the flame looks blue. That simply indicates that combustion takes place to completion. At times, you see parts of the burning droplet turn bright orange. The orange color indicates the formation of some [soot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot), i.e. products of incomplete combustion. These then give off a bright orange color similar to a typical fire on Earth. Finally, you can see some fluctuations in the drop, e.g. where the orange patches show up. This asymmetry helps the dying droplet swoosh away in one direction before it runs out of fuel and disappears.   ____  **Source:** [This video from NASA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQQ1OHW1_F4) and [NASA's explanation of the series of flame experiments.](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/480.html)

81840	0	a	>In the absence of gravity flames  Anybody know what a gravity flame is? Is it a Pokemon move or something?
81841	0	a	**Soot**  Soot  is a mass of impure carbon particles resulting from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. It is more properly restricted to the product of the gas-phase combustion process but is commonly extended to include the residual pyrolysed fuel particles such as coal, cenospheres, charred wood, and petroleum coke that may become airborne during pyrolysis and that are more properly identified as cokes or chars.  Soot causes cancer and lung disease, and may be the second-biggest human cause of global warming.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
81842	0	a	It's basically just electrical noise and defects in the detector. As the flame is very dim the signal needs to be amplified (think of cranking up the ISO setting on a digital camera). This noise in turn makes the background look wonky.

81847	0	a	"**Cenosphere**  A cenosphere is a lightweight, inert, hollow sphere made largely of silica and alumina and filled with air or inert gas, typically produced as a byproduct of coal combustion at thermal power plants. The color of cenospheres varies from gray to almost white and their density is about 0.4–0.8 g/cm3 (0.014–0.029 lb/cu in), which gives them a great buoyancy. Cf. glass microspheres.  ***  **Pyrolysis**  Pyrolysis is a thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere such as a vacuum gas. It involves the change of chemical composition and is irreversible. The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro ""fire"" and lysis ""separating"".  Pyrolysis is most commonly applied to the treatment of organic materials.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

81933	0	a	For a school project, I made my own baseball. Let me tell you, those machines they have that wrap the yarn and string do wonders. I wrapped mine by hand, and it was about 200 feet of string/yarn. The only reason they have people hand stitch the leather on them, is because there isn't a machine that exists that can do it. No machine has been invented that can sew a circular object with that particular type of stitching. Pretty cool. 
81934	0	a	They also rub it with secret New Jersey mud before using in games. Nothing about baseball makes sense.

81936	0	a	Not only that, but people seemingly just eying it, in terms of how much string/twine, and where to place it, does not seem like the best way to get professional baseballs that all weigh and react the same, which I assume is important at the highest levels.

81962	0	a	"The most famous case is Ray Chapman, but that was because the ball was dirty and misshapen. At that time baseballs were used for much longer than they are now; sometimes only a handful were used in a game. Pitchers were allowed to scuff the ball, and were allowed to apply a myriad of substances on the ball such as tobacco juice, licorice spit, dirt, etc. All of these applications fall under the general term ""spitball.""       The result was an earth-colored, misshapen ball that probably looked more like a rock than a baseball. Because it was misshapen it moved erratically, and because it was brown it was hard to see, and Chapman was hit in the head and killed. This was, of course, before players wore batting helmets.      The spitball was banned the following season, and a new rule was established saying umpires had to throw out a baseball once it was deemed dirty."

Where the fleeb is then rubbed against it. Its important that the fleeb is rubbed, because the fleeb has all the fleeb juice. Then a shlammie shows up and he rubs it and spits on it. They cut the fleeb. There are several hizzards in the way. The blamfs run against the trumbles and the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away. That leaves you with a regular old plumbus.

Took a few pictures.. uploading..  https://imgur.com/a/Ho3M6hU  Edit: I should probably mention that these are used, and its interesting that all the allen heads are pretty mangled (for being screwed into a bone) someone put some umph into tightening them. Also they are super light.  Edit 2: I guess cost on them is between $800 to $1200 dollars each, but often gets billed to insurance for around 12,000 dollars. But if you're looking for a DIY spinal screw they can be found on alibaba for like $25-40 each, saving you lots of money if you want to have a mechanically inclined machinist friend or family fix your back up.

81988	0	a	Person who has had the surgery here!    The surgery took 9 hours for my surgeon to do it! The transformation was pretty wild! I grew four whole inches overnight! And there's of course still some pain and physical limitations I now have, like the inability to bend my spine and a weight limit to what I can lift. It was indeed straightened right away! My surgeon did a really great job with it too!   I had to wait three days before I was allowed to walk, and even then it was just up and down the hallway. The pain was IMMENSE. It was five months before I could walk around the mall for a while without wanting to cry, and even longer before I could be on my feet and walking for several hours without a lot of pain. Even now I still have off days where walking or standing for a while hurts a lot, but for the most part it's all fine!

81990	0	a	god damn I didn't think they'd be that huge
81991	0	a	There was an ortho surgeon that talked about that in the leading comment. Basically they start with a smaller tap and don't go for a lot of torque.  If the smaller tap strips then they can go up to a bigger tap size. I assume the torque would stay the same.
81992	0	a	Orthopedic surgery in general is just... barbaric. Obviously it’s very precise and requires incredible skill, but watching it happen looks like a couple of guys trying to build a deck out back, or change a spare... lots of hammering and twisting and smacking.
81993	0	a	Yeah, I’ve heard the risks of it going wrong are low but if it goes wrong it can go really wrong. Which is why they usually only do it in extreme cases where the health consequences of the scoliosis are too bad.

81996	0	a	Yeah I guess I felt it too lol, very strange to watch...
81997	0	a	I assumed they were showing the process for a single screw and then speeding through the rest of them because it would be redundant. I could be wrong though.
81998	0	a	So gay conversion centers should try this procedure then?
81999	0	a	I’ve had dental braces, pushed out 2 babies without meds, and had this surgery. One of my nurses after the back surgery told me the pain I was in at the time was probably worse than childbirth and I believe she may have been right. The thing about childbirth is that once the baby is out, the pain can greatly and rapidly diminish (I know, I know, not always) and then you have a warm bundle of snuggly responsibly to distract you while your body does the rest of its healing. With the scoliosis surgery, all of the muscles in my back that had been cut apart took months to heal and I still have lingering sore spots and nerve damage 20 years later. I also had to relearn to walk a bit since my center of gravity was different and I was a few inches taller, which was interesting. To relate it back to your teeth, though, take all of the ouch from all of your braces adjustments, compress it into a single note of pain, spread it from your neck to your butt, and hold it there for a few months. That should give you a rough idea of this ache. There are worse pains, I know, but these are some I have known and can relate to each other.

82000	0	a	How long ago did you have your surgery? I had mine 2 yeara ago, my curvature before the surgery was 64° and 26° after. Two rods and 17 screws. Walked two laps around the hospital floor 6 hours after the surgery.
82001	0	a	So were you under painkillers the entire time? In comparison to anesthesia?

82004	0	a	Then the thread tapping before they cross threaded. Aw damn.
82005	0	a	no I think you’re correct about that. I think there was just something really offputting about how it kept zooming in and out. It could have just stay zoomed in to complete the drilling process and then zoomed out to speed through the other screws
82006	0	a	This was exactly how mine went pretty much.  I had my rods and screws taken out eventually because my body rejected them but the bones had been fused from what I was told so they werent moving anymore.  My back was just about as fucked as yours if not just a bit worse, I cant remember the exact degree.
82007	0	a	I would be shocked if they weren't under general anesthesia
82008	0	a	I’ve had two spinal fusion surgeries from stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Narrowing of the spinal canal and a vertebra out of alignment. This presses on the spinal cord and on the radicular nerves. My leg was going numb and starting to atrophy.  You better believe they put you under for this. They’re sawing and drilling on your fucking spine.  Then I had 24 hours of IV dilauded every hour. I definitely didn’t need a ride home from the hospital, as I could actually fly.   Then several weeks of Percocet 10/325 plus medrol steroid packs because of the bone swelling in my S1.
82009	0	a	Since I can't twist or curve my spine at all (I have the full fusion like in the gif) I can't do most yoga, which isn't a big deal for me because I'm personally not a fan but I could see how it could really suck if you enjoy it!! However, if your curvature isn't that bad you might only need a partial fusion, leaving other parts of your spine able to bend! But if you needed the full fusion, like I did, the odds are yoga wouldn't really be possible for the most part.  The surgery was definitely incredibly painful and put me out of commission for months, but I wouldn't change doing it because it was a life or death situation for me. I definitely have some issues related to it, but for the most part I live a pretty normal life! It really all depends on the pros and cons for you and which outweighs the other I'd say! 😅

82030	0	a	Depends on how fucked up your teeth were before the braces. Mine weren't so bad and I had to wear it for about a year afterwards. Afaik in extreme cases it may be indefinite.
82031	0	a	doctors say 6 years but they're lying pieces of shit. some people say the rest of your life. i'm guessing the rest of your life. i didnt wear mine because it was so difficult to sleep in and i'd wake up with horrible dry mouth. so about 8 years later, it began to shift and now my jaw hurts like crazy because the shift forced my lower jaw to push back further and further. i'm thinking that i might have to eventually get braces again to correct it. my teeth wasnt even bad before, i really regret ever getting it.

How many protein molecules do you need to claim that it's complex enough now to be real life? Does this not show that we are just complex machines, really complex, but still totally determined by little proteins doing their stuff?  Edit: microbiology -> molecular biology.

82043	0	a	"This process is happening constantly throughout your body. Kinesin is a motor protein that works to move cargo to the outside of the cell.   This [article] (http://book.bionumbers.org/how-fast-do-molecular-motors-move-on-cytoskeletal-filaments/)  states that kinesins working within the body move at a rate of 2000 nm/s. Meaning they take ~250 of these tiny steps a second. You could assume that this clip is greatly slowed down.    Bit from the link: ""For example, conventional kinesins have an in vitro speed of 800 nm/s (BNID 101506) and an in vivo speed of 2000 nm/s. This directed motion is made up of individual steps of 8 nm length (BNID 101857), thus requiring about 100 steps per second to achieve such speeds in vitro...""  EDIT: If you are interested in motor proteins and science minded. This [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9RUHJhskW00) does a pretty good job of covering the bases and makes it relatively easy to understand. "

82050	0	a	What do the proteins do when they get the end of a micro tube?
82051	0	a	There are two basic types of motor proteins that run along microtubules, kinesins and dyneins. Microtubules, unlike other filaments in a cell, have a “plus end” and a “minus end”. Kinesins head towards the plus end, dyneins head towards the minus end. When they get there, whatever cargo they’re dragging will usually be grabbed by whatever cellular process they’re delivering it to, and another kind of protein will facilitate kinesins and dyneins binding together, so dyneins will “hitchhike” back to the plus end of a microtubule on a kinesin that is heading that way.  https://elifesciences.org/articles/02641

Land animals have the luxury of gravity to hold their prey in place.  In the water, without the second mouth or other feature, the prey can float away or if the eel takes too long to eat, then it too can become prey to other bigger fish.  Other examples include the archaic fish (has mini claws to pull in fish), the exume fish which sucks in water and prey really fast and acts like a vacuum.  The wackiest one is the accountant fish and its named after the fact that I'm an accountant by trade and I made up all of this.  I'm sorry.

82230	0	a	This was honestly a bad example. Multiple ways though.   1. You isolate and ground the system. There will be nothing on it then.   2. A lot of insulated equipment. Hot line tools, bucket trucks, and gloves.   3. Barehand work.

82233	0	a	It's pretty fucking safe if you follow the rules...
82234	0	a	Sort of, but not quite. Both this example and faraday cages work because of the properties of a conductor. Faraday cages “block” electromagnetic radiation by distributing it throughout the conductor rather than letting it pass through the air.  The metallic glove here redirects the current and prevents it from passing through the person’s hand. Electricity takes the path of least resistance and in this case, metals and other conductors offer much less resistance than human flesh.  ~~Lastly, if you were to place a phone in the glove without it actually touching the glove, the glove would then act as a faraday cage (an insulating layer is required between the faraday cage and the receiver it is blocking).~~ Putting a phone in a glove would block the signal. I believe the case of the phone would act as an insulator between the signal received by the cage and the receiver itself.
82235	0	a	No doubt it is. Unfortunately for me, I get spooked by both heights and electricity. Ha ha.

82245	0	a	8 years for Earth or Venus?
82246	0	a	Yes, but the orbital eccentricities (amount of distortion from a perfect circle) of Venus and earth are 0.0068 and 0.017 respectively. To picture the smallness of these eccentricities, take the arcsine (inverse sine) of the eccentricity to get an inclination angle, then look at a perfect circle face-on and tilt it by that angle. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity#Definition))  arcsin(0.0068) = 0.39º  arcsin(0.017) = 0.97º  A circle tilted off-face by less than 1 degree is not going to look appreciably distorted.
82247	0	a	Big if true

82251	0	a	It's supposed to be interesting because the ratio between the orbital periods of any two planets will related by a ratio of small integers, because of the property of [orbital resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance).

82283	0	a	Being from San Francisco, my method is to pull up relatively close to the front car, back up and turn sharply once the middle column of your car is at the front car's rear bumper.

82308	0	a	this looked more like a tooth reconstruction than a chip fill.   i had 70% of my front tooth replaced (a little more missing than the start here) and it was $400 with insurance. next time it happens though they have to insert a rod in my jaw, do a bone graft, etc. it'll be 5k
82309	0	a	Just a Price-is-Right guess here, but if you paid $79 *with* insurance, i am going to guess $7,900 with out it. 
82310	0	a	Not sure if it's stronger or not since I had it a week ago, however it definitely feels more sturdier & there's no longer a chipped line that can be felt unlike the older procedure.

82313	0	a	I think a lot of dentists and people in the dental field have seen what a mess the American healthcare system has become and are very afraid or apprehensive to make the leap. Dental insurance is awful. I actually don’t call it insurance in my office because it’s not traditional insurance. It’s more like a coupon book. Regular people can afford dental work 3 ways: 1) making sure to go to your 6 month appointments having your teeth cleaned, exams done and X-rays taken. 2) when your dentist suggests doing a filling that’s “small” don’t argue and try to buy time. A small filling is maybe $200-300 - I get it’s a big expense. But if you just do it that should hopefully be the extent. 3) instead of buying dental insurance for $50/mo. Put $50/mo (or more into a HSA and use it when it becomes necessary). 
82314	0	a	"i am not doing it based on any information that is available here and now, that's why i called it a ""Price-is-Right Guess"", If you think i guessed too high you should guess a $1, if you think too low, guess $7,901. "

82330	0	a	Exactly, that's why they usually hide when they just molt. The time varies but mostly in spans of weeks. Before that they're defenseless piece of juicy free meat (cause they also purposefully swell with lots of water to make a bigger shell)  The so call shellless crabs are usually a product of trawling practices, although they are soft and very convenient to eat (which is a major plus for crabs), better not buy them unless they are bred and collected in controlled ways. Never support unsustainable trawling practices if you have the choice.

82337	0	a	Just a small side note.  While some may refer to Mecanum Wheels as omni wheels, technically [omni wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_wheel) are their own type of wheel. In their case, the rollers are aligned perpendicular to the driving wheel.
82338	0	a	I heard they were pretty expensive and the benefit over normal wheels doesn’t really align with the cost. Also could be more maintenance and overhead due to complexity. Im just spitballing here though
82339	0	a	I believe they're primarily used on equipment used indoors and on similarly good surfaces... like forklifts in factories. They're not that great for traction or efficiency, so beyond a flat surface not far from refueling/recharging, you really won't see them used.
82340	0	a	The year we got mecanum wheels was the best year. Although having to dedicate four motors to wheels is always a pain with the limits imposed.
82341	0	a	“We spent our whole build season making a mecanum drive train but it’s fine we’ll just play defense”
82342	0	a	You are correct.  Phew, ok I’ll break this down and slowly edit it as the conversation unfolds here.  This kind of thing is best discussed as a group.  Here we go (please pardon spelling, grammar, and sarcastic tones)  You also need to go through their training class which most medium level maint techs ~~won’t attend~~ would struggle to get funding and time-off to attend.  Likely the courses would be given as part of the contract and would have to be done locally at the buyers digression.  Physically this is a extremely situational idea for fork-trucks, and the company won’t get go-ahead from dept_safety to buy these ~~dangerous~~ intriguing wheels (in the likely legacy and rented building the company refurbished to).  Hazardous materials and fragile material handling may be the best usage of these in small hand operator functions.  Left-to-right forktruck movement is a seriously bad idea (let alone done in a vertical fashion over large poured concrete slabs with lines between each), and needs to be done slowly and with specific intent.  A dumped load could kill a nearby co-worker or the driver.  Automated systems may be preferable to save in training.  It ~~defeats~~ might undermine the purpose of the backplate.   Edit: A curved backplate may be an interesting idea.  No moving parts to maintain, and handles like normal.  A simple locking bar is also viable.  Most truck loads are lifted, and then tilted toward the backplate for stability.  With a slight curve to the edges you could regain any lost balance easily.  Edit: At lower speeds (<1 mph) this shouldn’t be a big concern though, at >2mph it may be an issue for large weights that are tallish. Now, time is money and most fork operators use gas powered units that run around 6mph, while most optimally charged electric units can only reach 3mph with fresh wheels in most cases due to used motors.  The new fresh yale units I’ve seen could report unrestricted 12mph speeds when in maint mode but their gas counter parts blow them away.    Edit: Elon, invest in fork-trucks please!  I’ll work to the bones with ye bro!  Anyway, 1200 lbs+ electronics or materials pallets and such would be a bit wishy-washy here.  Gotta go *slow*?  Kinda feel like the situations that would need these would still cause saving by not using them due to overhead.  A long term dedicated investment is probably desired, major early loses are expected, and the employees will have a harsh learning curve for operators.  Edit: But this tech/idea seems improvable. An overhaul/simplification of this type of tire concept, for a easier-to-maintain setup...with less required parts, (making less complicated larger rubber versions of these) could likely be designed and fitted to an aller terrain type vehicle.  The major load being counter-balanced by the battery, (and weight of the truck) is also being slightly defeated by moving right and left instead of forward and backward. A diagonal weight being applied is the best way to cause a tip/spill.    Edit: These tips and spills can psychologically (if they do everything to spec and didn’t get hurt) ruin a golden operator, and need to be weighed heavily.  Why redesign the wheel, when it means you need to redesign the road ~~forktruck and rack structure~~ as well?? (Edit: I liked the way the user below reworded this for me, please upvote him if you have the time to show thanks)  Edit: FOR SCIENCE!  Now if we had a silo full of racks in a circular setup with a circular fork-truck with these wheels, hell yeah sign my employees up! /s   Anchoring the lift is an interesting safety idea, but a few of these would allow donut-shaped rack joints instead of line-style rackings.  Edit: Wait no! How about tiny micro-warehouses in places like Japan, or shore-line property in say Hong Kong, maybe even San Fran.  Where you can buy/build into the sky, cheaper than you can buy land?  Those places may only allow for a small series of racks that are extremely narrow yet long chains of donuts.  Edit: This could allow smaller storage places to have a single unit that could reach those hard to check places.  Momentum in these scenarios would be minimal, also this would make lifting printers and server racks prolly feel a bit more smooth in tight spots.  The load would likely need to be tilted back further though. So setting another set of wheels may fix this design flaw of the rotational point being to far forward, but I’m sure a second set of these as supplemental wheels might do well.  It may also remove the need for foundational load-bearing floors for every seven or so stories, in turn saving tons on storage building materials (who am I kidding, you’ll rent like fools) for circumstantial buildings.  You could even have one of these sent up a tiny service elevator every seven stories, and make a super long+tall storage area to keep truck-parts needs to at a minimum!    Guess I’m really *reaching* here.  Edit edit edit edit: Hand-operated lift devices would be the best use for this product methinks.  A scissor lift, pallet jack, or other custom hand-operated assisted-lifting mechanism could take these a long distance.  The only problem then would be the internal motor aspects, which would be more like a ‘walkie-rider’ (imagine a motorized hand-jack that weights at least two tons you can ride on).  Edort:  Also to consider: Surface area pressure, small debris jamming wheels, decreased friction dissipation, and multi-motor maintenance.  The parts would have to be modular though, and the repair contract the company could/would lease out would be lucrative.  Turn-over on teachers for the production stream would be high so benefits and pay would have to be above market to maintain early business setup.  Another redline lose.  Though, It might also generate more tech and maint based jobs, and grassroots maint shops would pour more money into local economies. It would also  maintain a steady line of production-programmer and designers as well.  With the proper lack of a marketing department in early life a company like this, I could see being worthwhile to invest in...as long as they maintain good customer service, and have proper access to raw materials for parts.  One bad storm could send investors running!  Initial over head would be high, but the return in RnD proprieties selling the electronic-bearing control technology to electric-vehicle automation companies would be phenomenal.  Then we could add a set of these to the undercarriage of most electric cars, and whammo, push-button-parallel-parking.  Imagine nascar drifts with these bad boys installed!   After some communal brainstorming this could be implemented pretty well, but is a specialized tool, that is better implemented in sizes small than the content shown.

82360	0	a	**Ballooning (spider)**  Ballooning, sometimes called kiting, is a process by which spiders, and some other small invertebrates, move through the air by releasing one or more gossamer threads to catch the wind causing them to become airborne and at the mercy of air currents. This is primarily used by spiderlings to disperse; however, larger individuals have been observed using it. The spider climbs to a high point and takes a stance with its abdomen to the sky, releasing fine silk threads from its spinneret until it becomes aloft. Journeys achieved vary from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

82578	0	a	Make sure you are juggling in a plane in front of you instead of trying to throw then in a line away from you if that makes sense. Like if you stood facing a wall they should always be the same distance from the wall.  Then drill one hand two balls in columns next to each other with both hands. You can see her doing columns right near the beginning she does it a couple times. This gets you used to throwing before you catch rather than at the same time which is what most people do when they first start out.
82579	0	a	/r/juggling is a thing.    I've taught about 50 people 3 ball cascade which is the basic three ball pattern. On average it takes about 30 minutes to get the concept and be able to do it. With three balls only one ball is in the air most of the time. If you can toss 1 ball back and forth easily you can probably learn 3 ball cascade in less than 40 minutes. Dropping happens a lot and tends to get to people.    I'd say 6 hours is enough time to have 3 ball cascade solid, where you'll get bored with it and move onto tricks.

82600	0	a	First off, let me acknowledge that it’s strange to learn, as an adult, that you don’t know how to do something basic like drink out of a cup. I know what you’re going through. I’ve been there. Still, hear me out.   For years, I could not understand how my wife was able to drink tea while it was still hot enough to burn tile. I’m talking liquid magma that I could hardly hold, my sweet wife would happily sip away at, with no apparent ill effects.   One day we both ordered a cup of tea and after seeing her start drinking it immediately, I assumed it was safe enough and promptly burned the hell out of my tongue on the still flaming satan piss in that cup. As I nursed my now-blistered tongue, I asked my wife how much asbestos she had eaten as a child in order to allow her to chew burning coals like that.   She looked confused for a second and then said “you can’t suck your tea like your lips are a straw, you need to draw in the top layer of tea using your top lip like a lasso.”  I tried it, and it changed my life. Seriously, just tilt the cup so the drink is level with the rim, rest your upper lip on top of the (scalding hot) liquid, and pull it in, bringing a little tea with it. The evaporation cools the very top of your drink quickly enough to make it drinkable. If you suck from lower down or pour it into your mouth, you will burn a hole right through your face.

82631	0	a	The adults are cooks that have a lot of experience from less stress demanding cooking jobs and thats why he gets pissed at them. They should know what the fuck they are doing.

82632	0	a	I've been to his a few of his restaurants in town and I'm disappointed everytime. The food is excellent and the service is fantastic.   I always wish he would just make an appearance to scream fucking obscenities at me while I eat but no, it never happens.

82634	0	a	 This reminds me of this contestant on the last season of US MasterChef. There was a 19 year old fast food worker named Gabriel who had made it to the top 5. When he got voted out, Gordon gave him a full ride scholarship to culinary school out of his own pocket.  Everyone on the show was crying. I was crying. It was one of the sweetest things I've ever seen anyone do. And Gordon Ramsay did it

82636	0	a	Coaching kids and pressuring adults. That's exactly what you need to do. You want children to learn and be passionate about something.

82639	0	a	Outside of shows like Hells kitchen, and the American version of kitchen nightmares, I've never known someone who wore on their sleeve, just how much they love cooking than Gordon Ramsey. I saw a video of him making donuts where he's so happy, people have joked about it seeming almost sexual. The other side of it is that he can't stand people who are incompetent in the kitchen, when they should be more than capable, but I don't think the anger is what defines him as a person.
82640	0	a	"Hell's Kitchen is a show designed for Gordon's to scream.   The cooks they get on that show are mid level at best and do not posses the skills to truly work in one of his kitchens.  I have worked in fine dining kitchens with multiple cooks who have worked in Ramsey restaurants in NYC and LA.  I am told it is a very, very demanding environment, even without Ramsey's presence.      One of my buddies used to work at the Ramsey restaurant in the London hotel in Hollywood when a Hell's Kitchen winner won the ""Head Chef"" position.  He said that they stuck her in the salad station because she couldn't hang.   "
82641	0	a	I always liked how he would arrange some kind of activity that would help the owners understand and change their behavior. That doesn't happen in the US version.

82650	0	a	If you truly try to succeed around Gordon, he will help you become a better person and become an amazing chef. If you really watch his shows you start to see the real person that just wants people to be who they claim to be and are willing to work for it. He gets a lot of flack because of the parts everyone focuses on from show highlights but they never show the parts where he is hugging everyone at the end. I know someone who did the audio for a season of Hells kitchen and she was amazed by how awesome he actually is to those people. Show up, do your job, and don't bullshit.

There were a lot of open forums, where he had past diners come in and talk about how their experiences were, and another thing he did a few times were “art” galleries where he’d photograph the restaurant’s food, and the food of other places within a few blocks. There’s one where he even took a father and son out to Vegas to go to a mom and pop’s place that’s been going for over 100 years, just to show them how successful small restaurants can be.   The whole thing’s on Amazon, and I just finished watching it about two nights ago. I was surprised at how much the shouting really is played up by the memes. There is a lot of shouting, but he’s also very constructive with people who admit that their restaurant is a shit show.

I think the user is referring to the separate series's of kitchen nightmares (the UK version was first and called Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares not Kitchen Nightmares, there Gordon is much calmer and more constructive). The user, I think, is not referring to the rebroadcast of the us kitchen nightmares for UK networks.   Edit: wrong user indicated. I blame Reddit app
82663	0	a	Ramzy has absolutely no patience for people who should know better or people in denial. If people were willing to listen and work with him he was great. If they dug their heels in that's when the shouting started.   Mama Cheri's is a good example because everyone there was willing to engage and change. He had to tell people off and set them straight but never had to yell as they were all open to criticism. When he revisited he didn't hesitate to tell them all off for letting the quality of their food drop. But again he didn't have to yell because they were again open to criticism and took it all on board. 
82664	0	a	I think the biggest failing in the US version is just the editing. I suspect in part it's the number of commercial breaks in a 30 minute segment being more in the US than the UK, but it's also purposefully editing the show around those breaks as if the viewer was the protagonist from Memento, and needed reminding of the previous five minutes of television after a break (and a teaser of what's to come shortly before they go to the next one.)  Like a lot of American television it becomes exhausting to watch. It's so fixated on the drama that it overwhelms the food.

But instead of just being depressed about losing his chance at his dream, he told his mom that he’s gonna be the best chef in the world. Now he has the second most Michelin stars attached to his name - the number one guy is literally Ramsey’s mentor! He’s built an international business from the ground up. Every restaurant he owns, he started and built on his own. He only leaves his restaurants after they’ve achieved success and are finally able to maintain themselves without him.  The man is legend.  Edit: apparently he wasn’t signed into the team, he made that up. But he was going to try out!

82677	0	a	I presume the cars are of similar mass. It is more remarkable when you recognize that manufacturers have been designing cars to maintain the integrity of the passenger compartment by crushing the engine compartment since the late sixties (Volvo, Mercedes and BMW being standout examples). Obviously the state of the art has been advancing.

I walked down to take a shower one day at around noon wearing nothing but a towel around my waist. When I got back to my room my roommate had left and locked the door on me. I had to walk down three flights of stairs, past hoards of fellow students, and into the main lobby in broad daylight to ask for a spare key.

Anyways I decide to go gambling because I’m bored and love slots and by golly I won a thousand bucks! I decided to treat myself to a fancy room service dinner. After I’m done I had a shower and thought I should push the cart outside so I could dry my hair without interruption. I only have a towel on that barely covers my core.   I push the cart but there is a lip on the door so i push extra hard and the cart goes flying into the hall. I panic as we were at the Luxor that it’s gonna go over the railing so I dart out to get it and all I hear is CLICK. The door shuts.   After about 5 mins of absolute terror I work up the courage to find a phone by the elevator. After a slight giggle they sent someone right up and let me in.

82846	0	a	"I worked at a hotel doing security for a tour group once. My job was to sit at the end of the hallway and watch the doors. My group was on the right.  At about 2am, a door on the left opens up, and a large man steps out completely naked and eyes all but closed. He stands in the hallway like a zombie for about 10 seconds, bobbing his chin against his chest and looking at the floor. Suddenly he jerked upright and looked around apparently realizing he was naked in the hotel hallway, jumps towards the door and starts rattling the knob. When he realizes the doors not opening, he crouches in the corner   with his face against the wall sheepishly and covers his bits.  It took me a second to realize that he had likely been sleepwalking, and woke up ass naked in the hallway, probably terrified and embarrassed.   All I said was ""Ill get you a key"" and walked down to the front desk.  When I got there, they said all they needed to do to give me the key was to call the room first and make sure there was no answer. They called, the phone rang, and they gave me the room key. I brought it up to him and suggested he call the office to make sure they knew they were all set.   "

82848	0	a	Wasn’t this literally a Mr Bean episode?
82849	0	a	I had that happen as well, except I had some PJs (boxers and a tank top) with me.  The problem was that it was winter in Utah and snowing and they wanted me to walk down to the student center 5 minutes away. With no shoes on.  I got in an argument with the housing person, without success, and had to go over there. I wonder if they’d still make me do it if I’d been in a towel.
82850	0	a	This may be fake, but it totally happens. It’s rare, in a hotel of 356 rooms it happens maybe once per year, but it never fails to make our day.

82853	0	a	Well yes, there was also a procedure for opening a room door when you aren't sure if there is someone in the room. You knock and wait several seconds for a response, then crack the door and announce yourself and wait several seconds, then fully open the door and announce yourself again.

83032	0	a	"I don't know where this myth popped up from, but I've been hearing it a lot. Although it is perfectly legal to do so according to the USDA, chicken is not being sent to China or anywhere else for processing. The US chicken industry has a very very very successful vertical integration process with farms located around a processing plant. It's so efficient that marginal costs just get lower and lower as technology increases. It would make no sense to send it over seas to another company for processing and then send back to the US. Also, the wide majority of US poultry is in the East, and for my company it's a logistical enough nightmare just to get it to the West coast. I can't imagine unprocessed birds having to be shipped.   We do send a shit ton of chicken to China though. As their QOL gets better, they demand more protein, and chicken is the perfect, cheap source for it. Maybe the mass poultry export we have is how the myth got started? There's nothing stopping China from process it further, but it's not coming back.   Source: [I work in the poultry industry](https://i.imgur.com/AUv3W7s.jpg)  Edit: [Vertical integration map and article](http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/industry-issues/vertical-integration/)  The poultry industry gets what seems like a false rumor spread about it every day. People wonder why we're so closed door, but shithole places like HSUS take pictures of humane and legal things, skew then out of context, and then make up some lie about what is in the picture. It's sick and had gotten me and a coworker cussed out in Cincinnati. (We were talking about work and bitch with the ""let me see your manager"" haircut in front of us overheard and thought we should know what we were doing. We just wanted to watch the reds game.)  Edit 2: u/StealthMarmot very kindly share where this [rumor got started](https://www.snopes.com/china-chicken-reshipped/). It literally says ""**FALSE**"" right after it lol. China is now allowed to send us their chicken, we're not playing some type of odd game of Pong with poultry across the Pacific. The worst part is that at least a couple hundred more people now believe we send chicken on a round trip with China. No one's real fault, but I guess ignorance breeds ignorance. In any case, I hope I've presented enough evidence for you to change your mind on what you thought we did, u/magnanimous- ."

83052	0	a	I did this around 4 years ago, to this guy I worked with, only I used his own face from a pic that the company used for promotional stuff.   Can confirm, new employees keep finding them. Some of the faces migrated to other cubicles (around plants for some reason) which is a nice way to keep people sharp. Also he decided to keep the ceiling ones so those are always fun to point out to whoever gets his desk, about 6 months after they get hired. He also never found the ones inside his headphones and I want to believe the company doesn't recycle those between employees so they are probably gone for good, but if not, someone is going to be very surprised to learn why the sound was a little muffled in the left ear.  Edit: grammar
83053	0	a	Some of these will be found by the post-human extinction, cockroach historians, millions of years from now.
83054	0	a	For Cages, even
83055	0	a	"I did this with plastic Easter eggs the first year my wife and I dated.  I hid 36 in her room, and 24 in the living room (the shared space with her roommates).  I wrote individual numbered notes to tuck into each egg with the candy.  She found numbers 1-4 consecutively, but when she found number 22 out of sequence she called me, ""OK.  How.  Many.  Eggs?!""  I had to show her where the final one was."
83056	0	a	"This is amazing.  I love the bird that goes the wrong way! ""shit, shit, shit, play it cool, no one noticed..."""
83057	0	a	It's a Rube Goodboye machine
83058	0	a	I've seen this in person!  Busch Gardens in Virginia, in their wildlife conservation section. It's a really good show, and free to attend once you get into the park.  My favorite bit was a rat who was taught to walk a tightrope. Really cool!
83059	0	a	I think the only thing that may have been easy was that one cat to sit in one place.   The coordination and choreography is splendid.  Awesome job!!
83060	0	a	What the hell? How do you even train cats?
83061	0	a	"They have a show like this at SeaWorld called ""Pets Rule."" They're all rescued ""untrainable"" dogs and cats (with a pot bellied pig) who were scheduled for death.  My favorite show at the park."
83062	0	a	Great show but I wish the actors gave more emotion. They seemed to just be going through the motions and complete a task. My kids loved the show but I left with a sense of emptiness. My wife would have loved it but she passed away about a year ago. Maybe I just couldn't stop thinking about her... well I'm glad the kids enjoyed it, I just hope they haven't forgotten about their mother. 
83063	0	a	I love the cat the just rotates out and does absolutely nothing like it had no idea there was a elaborate production going on 
83064	0	a	Meanwhile I cant get my cat to not scratch the hell out of me when I brush her
83065	0	a	*applause*
83066	0	a	My favorite part about it is that usually some of the animals in the show are up for adoption, and you can ~~talk to~~ pet the cast members after the show and discuss adoption with the handlers if you are interested!
83067	0	a	Ooooh look at Cesar Milan over here with his sitting dog.
83068	0	a	I honestly thought that cat just got caught lickin his bits instead of that pose being part of the show. Like “Pancakes goes off script sometimes but we still love him”. 
83069	0	a	Cats are only untrainable because people think that they're untrainable. They're really not that different from dogs.
83070	0	a	The same way you train anything? Repetition an a combination of positive and negative reinforcement.
83071	0	a	I'm fairly sure it was licking itself just before. 
83072	0	a	That’s awesome. Shows how these animals can be trained given enough time and effort. 
83073	0	a	100% to this my cats listen because from the get go i treated them like dogs. They have to sit before they eat. They listen to me and my gf when we tell them to come. They are also the nicest cats tho they have never scratched or bitten us. 
83074	0	a	Can confirm.    Source: Expert self-licker.
83075	0	a	Then you take one of the cats home and it trains you to feed it on command and clean its shit out of a box.

83079	0	a	That’s a special level of drunk.
83080	0	a	This can't be real. I think.
83081	0	a	He may have poor vision. This coupled with being drunk, it isn't too far fetched. Imagine that all he saw was a blurry figure and not the perfect reflection of himself that ourselves with our speacial eyes see so clearly see.  *A word **Edit: *A word Fuck me.
83082	0	a	Shame he’s being so nice to the other person. 
83083	0	a	They both agreed on taking another route
83084	0	a	I wonder how long he was doing this before someone realized they should tape this. Lol
83085	0	a	At some point after multiple attempts, he pauses, and I thought he'd finally realised his mistake  Then he stepped back to let the other one pass and I discovered the scrubber wasn't even half way done.
83086	0	a	"Nope. Every time he shoved his mirror self I expected him to go at it. He backs up and spreads his hands like ""cahmahn I'm tryna walk heeya"""
83087	0	a	"Nope, you aren't the only one. Something like this happened to me a few years ago in a haunted house. Being a few whiskeys in, I ventured into an incredibly loud, strobe-filled building where you walk in line and wait for evil things to jump out at you. I was with a group of about 10, and filled with liquid courage, I took point.   I rounded the corner of one walkway and was met with this ugly looking thing staring right at me. I wasn't going to back down. I puffed out my chest, stiffened my spine, and started walking directly at him. He did the same. I tried going right. So did he. I tried going left. He did too. I was getting pissed and was about to push this thing out of my way. In my mind I wanted to beat its ass.   My wife tapped me on the should and shouted in my ear, ""It's a mirror!"" I turn back around to see her and my friends all laughing at me. I blinked a few times to get rid of the haze, looked in the mirror again, and really see that it was me. I was such a dumbass. I spent the rest of the night pretty embarrassed, and also wondering if I really looked that ugly. "
83088	0	a	Nice
83089	0	a	That mirror is clean af
83090	0	a	My theory is that man has never seen a  mirror and he’s shitfaced
83091	0	a	It's probably dementia mixed with alcohol. It was kinda funny until I realized that and then I felt sad.
83092	0	a	This would have been funny if I hadn’t worked in a retirement home and seen similar things fairly often there from residents with extreme dementia. It just ended up seeming sad to me. :(
83093	0	a	Or he has dementia and literally doesn't recognize the frail old man in the mirror as being himself.
83094	0	a	Hey, I'm walkin here!
83095	0	a	Sorta hard to tell this gif being about 480p. 
83096	0	a	I like to think he's so drunk he doesn't realize he's old now
83097	0	a	We got a sayin' in Brooklyn!
83098	0	a	The “p” in 480p stands for potato. 
83099	0	a	He may actually need one after that
83100	0	a	More importantly, is he wearing a thong? 
83101	0	a	Maybe he was given the wheelchair because he kept knocking himself out everywhere
83102	0	a	Holy shit I’m cured!!!!!
83103	0	a	Is it just me or does it look like the left footrest makes sparks when it scrapes the ground at the beginning
83104	0	a	It gave. And it gave again. 
83105	0	a	I don't like to jump to conclusions, but I think his legs work.
83106	0	a	i'm no doctor, but jumping on the floor like that is not good for the spine 
83107	0	a	True. But he landed with perfect flat back technique and may have even slapped the ground. That’s picturesque for most martial art practices and even professional wrestling. 
83108	0	a	I think it might just be lacy, pink, silken undies.  Either way, the question stands, unlike him.
83109	0	a	And immediately uncured after the leap. 
83110	0	a	Does look that way, but I think because it's wet it's making a reflection from the street light
83111	0	a	Spinebrokenafterjumpingoverwheelchairologist here. My professional assessment is: rip that dude's spine.
83112	0	a	He’s doing this all for attention right? I mean why is someone filming otherwise?
83113	0	a	thank you for your professional assessment, you seem to have a very specialized field, i'm glad we could have used it
83114	0	a	Glad I could help. My 8 year journey, studying full-time, was finally vindicated.
83115	0	a	It looks... Happy?
83116	0	a	My mom being the life lover that she is used to rescue them from the pool at our previous home, and would resuscitate them after they accidentally drowned. I remember watching her numerous times as she’d stand in the kitchen with the dragonfly on a paper towel while she gently blew air on them. After a few hours I’d be amazed as they’d usually slowly come back to life. By morning I’m guessing their wings and lungs were dried enough that she’d release them back outside again. She couldn’t save all the ones she tried to rescue, but numerous ones ended up making it. I’m still amazed that she was able to do it.
83117	0	a	I always thought dragon flies were cool cause they have been around for so long but have barely changed, they can hover and go in almost any direction without turning and they have some of the most advanced compound eyes. They also look pretty cool and are surprisingly intelligent for an insect that just flies around and eats things.
83118	0	a	All of nature smiles it seems. You just have to look close enough.  Edit: my first silver. I'm truly humbled. Thank you kind stranger.  Edit 2: Oh boy oh boy oh boy... Mom, moooom... I got gilded... What's that dear.... Oh never mind. Thank you lovely stranger.

83123	0	a	Thanks for that story, my mom used to do the same! Good hearted moms.
83124	0	a	>just flies around and eats things  Understatement.  These guys are top predators. They catch their prey mid-flight by predicting where their target will be and leading them off, instead of giving a direct-line chase.  They don't just eat. They fucking kill.
83125	0	a	Yeah... a penis
83126	0	a	It’s eyes feel SO GOOD!!!
83127	0	a	Can't help but imagine this in a comedy sketch where the woman resuscitates a dragonfly, pampers it until fully healthy, releases it outside only to have it dive directly into the pool again.
83128	0	a	And they eat a lot of the worst bugs like black flies, deer flies and horse flies

83146	0	a	Yeah, that’s disgusting. I just think kids should be kids. Let them have their little silly moments as long as they’re not hurting anyone. Maybe teachers just like to have control over people and that could explain why we have pedophiles as teachers? That’s just a wild guess, I don’t really know.

83148	0	a	HE LOOOOOOVES THAT MEAT!!
83149	0	a	Feels more like there are some that will abuse any power given to them, even if that just means being a cunt to kids. Kids have to ask to use the restroom, to provide an example.

83153	0	a	My family is weird, we are all real close but don’t tell each other I love you, hug, kiss or all that. It would just feel weird and awkward.

I still fully support people being themselves and spreading silliness and fun, but apparently this is NOT the guy to support. Oh well.
