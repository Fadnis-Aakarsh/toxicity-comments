58205	0	a	I worked on a peer counseling helpline in school and would just like to point out to anyone who is interested that there actually *is* a reason you should not give your name to a caller. Put simply, the phone is an inappropriate place for there to be too intense of a bidirectional relationship. If there is, the caller could easily become dependent on the specific counselor they call. This leads to issues of staffing and timing of course, but more importantly, the caller could begin moving out of scope of what over-the-phone counseling can assist with. By sharing personal information with our callers, counselors may end up creating a relationship with them that would discourage the caller from seeing professionals who are far more effective with in-person therapy, thereby ultimately doing more harm than good.  Basically, our psychologist-director used to tell us that the last thing you want as an over the phone counselor is to have the same person *call you specifically* every time they wanted to harm themselves; it's not easily solvable and you will be ultimately burdened beyond your capability. It's best for people in that situation to make standing appointments with a therapist who can teach them skills and take advantage of face to face rapport. Phone calls don't have the same effectiveness, so they are best used for venting occasional frustrations and difficulties on an anonymous basis.   What's more, the Pavlovian learning mechanism could lead to that caller being unable to unlearn the link between feelings of suicide and just talking to one specific guy or girl. They need a bigger toolbox than that.  Plus, there's legal stuff (caller kills themselves and evidence suggests that they've spoken to person Y every single day including at the time they kill themselves; Y couldn't save them; how do you prove Y was not responsible?)

I was going through a lot, and as I was telling the guy that I just wanted to die because of the abuse he said, ""well, have you tried changing your attitude?"" I immediately hung up on him. It pissed me off so much.   I am still alive, but later that night I did attempt suicide. I sometimes wonder if I had gotten someone else if I'd never have attempted it. But that's in my past now, I have the future to look forward to."

58214	0	a	I am guessing the kids help line is a different number but I can vouch for them if any youngin here is seeking a friendly person to chat to. Nearly 20 years ago shitty teenage me prank called kids help line and pretended to be pregnant or something and despite all the giggling and bullshit the person on the line was AMAZING. Friendly, encouraging and saw right through my bullshit, she made sure I was truly ok and let me know that they are always there for me. I wish I was as awesome as the people who handle those calls, takes someone truly special.
58215	0	a	Same! We were told to pick a fake name we could remember so they could still track if someone was looking for a specific person to talk to but we were still allowed to go give that fake name. I think some people just find it easier to talk to someone if they have a name, it’s hard to open up to a stranger.

58220	0	a	Perhaps a system-wide nickname could be used.  Think something like nurses and cops on Pokemon.  All of the nurses are Nurse Joy and all of the police officers are Officer Jenny.  A system like this would avoid sharing personal information and avoid individual connection, but still provide callers a name to refer to.  
58221	0	a	At Samaritans (in the UK) everyone gives their name as Jo. Still personal, gender neutral, and you can't ask for the same person because they wouldn't know which one to give you. 
58222	0	a	Interesting point. I had not considered that. However, I can’t imagine a WORSE way to approach this challenge than hanging up on the caller.

58230	0	a	The post above says they don’t do this specifically to avoid having callers ask for a specific person. Where are you from?
58231	0	a	We only hang up under certain circumstances. When callers are threatening or verbally abusing a counselor, for example. There were other situations where we wouldn’t hang up but would firmly end the call. There were 30 or so “regular” callers who we would hear from every few days or every few hours. We had these people on a binder so that new counselors would have a better understanding of their situations and how to speak with them. Sometimes we had a name and other times we could figure out by how they spoke. Anyway, some of the very frequent callers were restricted on how many calls per day. We were a small center serving a large area with only so many people to keep it staffed 24 hours a day. Others were banned, temporarily or permanently for verbally abusing a counselor in the past.   Anyway, yeah. We try not to hang up. But sometimes we had to. 
58232	0	a	To maintain healthy boundaries in a therapeutic relationship. It’s about the caller, not any personal info about you. So we used the pseudonym, don’t share personal experiences or opinions, etc. It was all about reflective listening, unconditional positive regard, and helping people sort through their thoughts and feelings to see what can be done to fix that pain/fear/etc. Aside from that, I have a really uncommon name and that would have made me more easily identifiable than others.

58240	0	a	Just...be prepared to deal with talking to people who have issues. I tried to talk to someone on r/suicidewatch. I was depressed myself and thought maybe helping someone else would make me feel better somehow.   He had me 100% convinced he was committing suicide as we talked. I contacted mods for advice and they explained that there was little they could do, blah, blah, yada, yada. He said “goodbye” and I went to bed that night convinced he was dead. I checked his profile incessantly the next few days and he was casually commmenting on various topics. I PM’d him to say I wished he’d told me he was ok (I did NOT try to guilt trip him in ANY way, just said I wished he’d told me he was alive) and he basically blew me off. I understand why, but I just can’t deal with that kind of emotional roller coaster so I don’t reply to posts on those subs anymore. 
58241	0	a	There can also be trained volunteers but professionals who just phone it in. We'll never know though. Regardless, professional or not, some of them have never gone through serious depression and suicidal ideation. But for those who have, and are really trying to help and reach out, they know the right words to ask, and much more better if they're trained. 
58242	0	a	My therapist told me that a good way to cope with my infant daughter dying and needing to be resuscitated in front of me (she lived!) was to “record her laughter just in case she dies for real”  Some therapists just should not be therapists.
58243	0	a	"""Hi, just calling back to see how you went.  Let me know if you need assistance""."
58244	0	a	From experience I would say that very, very few are unqualified at all - the training is very rigorous and only people who are passionate and good at it stay on to actually get on the phones unsupervised.  The unfortunate fact is that Lifeline is run by volunteers who routinely have to face some pretty dreadful working conditions. Yes, there are individuals who call imminently suicidal, and Lifeline workers are trained to help these people. These are in fact few and far between (I would estimate somewhere around one to three calls per year). Lifeline has become a de facto generic mental health help line, rather than exclusively suicide prevention, and the result is that quite a number of calls you take are from people needing to vent, hear some reassurance or get access to services. These are the good calls where you actually feel you’re connecting and helping someone, but at the same time Lifeline is limited in resources, and providing 100% free counselling over the phone encourages some callers to rely on it, depriving people imminently in danger (e.g. suicide, psychotic episodes, domestic violence) from being able to reach the service. So time is precious, and typically Lifeline workers aim to hear these people out, help, but more importantly direct them to local services better equipped to support them.  But then there’s the bad calls. You get a lot of these. Alcoholics who ring repeatedly spouting torrents of abuse towards to you. Delusional people who just cannot be helped, but who you worry about. People who have had bad experiences with Lifeline in the past and take it out on you. Prank calls are an unfortunately frequent occurrence. It’s rough. And if you’re a woman, you get sex calls shockingly often - people who pretend to be having a rough time, wanting to hear you speak in a soft, comforting voice, subtly trying to get you to use suggestive language, who take weird pleasure in revealing they’ve been masurbating the whole time.   What I’m saying is that almost every Lifeline worker I’ve met starts out a shift with a goal of really helping people, and are fully trained to do so (it takes a months long course, and years of provisional placement  before you’re fully qualified). They’re serious about this work, and they’re doing it for free. But it’s entirely possible that they’ve been putting up with a world of shit in their prior 3 calls and don’t quite meet your needs or use the right tone or language with you. As /u/ADuckNamedPhil said, they’re people too.
58245	0	a	Callers were permitted to ask for counselors by name at our center. However, when those requests are repeated or the caller is insistent upon speaking to that person and not others, we would stop fulfilling that request. For repeat callers, it can add some level of continuity. When it becomes a potential boundary issue, it is remedied. 
58246	0	a	Thank you for sparing me from having to Google that

58249	0	a	What would be the problem with a caller requesting to speak with the same counsellor every time rather than another? Surely once a bond is formed a better outcome is achieved?
58250	0	a	No problem :) In situations wherein a caller is being abusive at the present time or in the past OR if the caller is on a time/call limit for the day (this is only in extreme cases of regular callers who would call 10+ times per day). If it were an abusive caller who is unable to calm down, you warn that you will need to hang up. If it continues, “You have continued to be abusive and I need to end the call. I hope you will call back when you are ready to talk to me.” And if it continues still - we would hang up. At some point, a caller may be banned permanently for this type of behavior despite many warnings and temporary bans. Sometimes it’s “I’m going to kill you,” other times it’s “I’m going to describe very detailed and disturbing sexual things that I want to do to you.”   For regulars who called multiple times per day, every day - they knew their limits. Usually it was 3 calls a day. We would just remind them which call they are on and ask if they would like to talk now or later in the day. We wouldn’t hang up on these callers but would make sure they understood the limits and that we needed to speak to others in crisis as well. Sometimes a person would be in a worse mood/situation than usual and we made changes for that when necessary. We were a small center and without those limits, our lines would be tied up most of the day with regulars while others would be unable to get through.   Basically we would make it clear that we do care but there have to be limits so we can keep the callers and ourselves as safe as possible. 
58251	0	a	"More specifically it means ""May God reward you with goodness."" "
58252	0	a	"The problem might be shifts or the person quitting or having other engagements within the organisation. Not to mention many people working lifelines are volunteers who shouldn't feel guilty about not being there for a specific person time and time again. It drains you when we're talking about something as serious as suicide. You might even end up with a bunch of people specifically asking for you. It's a lot to put on a person.   Also, it's meant as an ""on the spot"" type of help, they're not therapists. A therapist is a better choice if you need longterm help. "

He would hold the balloon to his ear and rest the other side to a column or pole that held up the roof to the stage. I'd watch him nod his head to the beat for hours. He started coming at a young age. And through the years the festival got more and more hippie. I noticed he wasnt enjoying himself as much one year. I wrote a note asking if he was ok. He started a little panic attack. That year his friends fed him acid for the first time. After he wrote me saying he was tripping for the first time, I took him backstage to hang out with the bands and other staff. Mostly so we could make sure he was gonna be alright. The memory of the smile on his face will provide me with warm fuzziness the rest of my life.

58283	0	a	Looks like she’s using SEE- signed exact English, but based off ASL signs.  Her signs are correct, but she’s using them in a very spoken English order.  For most signing languages, they have a different emphasis on word order, and some of it can be more conceptual or visual than keeping to the sentence structure of a spoken language.  Based off of this, and the father’s age, I’m betting he either went deaf later in life, or was taught in a more hearing-based way- as opposed to being immersed in the dead world.
58284	0	a	One of my teachers had previously taught at a school for the deaf. The school had dances like any other school but he said that the bass was turned SO high up that he thought he was having a heart attack.   Said the deaf dances were easier to chaperone because you could sign at them and they couldn’t pretend not to hear you over the music.

58293	0	a	This for sure, it takes a goddamn degree to translate to correct grammar while someone speaks, and when someone is singing with metaphors and idioms is even harder. She's probably just going off of memory of the song too and not interpreting as she's listening. *probably*

58295	0	a	"Such a simple but amazing photo.  Your mom suffered so much loss. And here she's got a chance to hear her daughter's heartbeat within a body so different. I can't imagine the kinds of emotions she's feeling.  And this healthy looking, ""tough guy"" with  his funky hair, Vegas shirt and his cool tattoo sleeve with a shark on his hand. You would never imagine him needing anything from anyone, much less a heart. But he did.  So underneath that tough guy exterior beats the heart of a much loved, much missed sister and daughter. Imagine that.

Please read OP's comment. I'm an organ donor. You should be too."
58296	0	a	Thanks everyone for all the heartfelt comments. I could not stop crying today when my mother shared this picture with me. I work from home and my fiance is far away so I had no one to share it with.   This was the text she sent me  > I will confess when I first heard the heartbeat I broke down, but Kyle bless him he hugged me until I stopped crying then his mom hugged me while Tina (older sister) listened. The picture you saw was taken about 1/2 hour later when Kyle helped me try again so I could listen longer.  If you're not already an organ donor please sign up. When we were facing so many difficult decisions this one my loving sister had already made for us. We knew what she wanted. It made the struggle one step easier. The impact it has had on the lives of the recipients is beyond words.  Edit: My mom laughed at all the comments about the stethoscope being backwards  > Lol the stethoscope was backwards. Kyle had them in his ears first to find the best spot so when I moved them to my ears the were wrong but worked  Edit 2: Thank you again for all the well wishing, condolences, and personal stories. My mom and Kyle have both seen this post. This photo was originally posted on [Midwest Transplant Network](https://www.facebook.com/MidwestTransplantNetwork) to help them raise awareness of the importance of organ donation. I am overwhelmed by the number of comments made from Redditors who have been inspired to opt in as well as support from those who previously made the decision. Thank you for choosing to support the gift of life.  Edit 3 8/Jul: My mother messaged me on Facebook this morning  > I was amazed at all the kind words from so many people! Thanks for sharing if just one person’s life is saved so worth it.

58299	0	a	I can’t imagine the feeling of hearing a heartbeat you first heard from inside yourself inside another person. I love when donor families and recipients do this, though! It’s got to bring some sense of closure.
58300	0	a	I actually don't know what to think about this:  This must be hard, it must be hard to hear that heart, that one heart once beating in your daughter, now beating into someone else's chest. It must be painful, must feel unfair, stolen... and if this is part of everything she, or better the whole family, is feeling, I just can say I'm close to you.  At the same time it must feel good, to know that the same heart has now a new chance to keep beating, keep pumping, feel life flowing through it. It's not done, not yet, it has still work to do.  And see that guy who's now standing there, feeling that gift, a gift of life, a life who didn't surrender, showing his gratitude, showing after all she's still there, pumping, alive... this truly is wholesome  It's a weird situation, a weird feeling, but overall I think it's a good one

58303	0	a	I remember hearing my daughter's heartbeat for the first time when I went in for my first ultrasound.  That's probably the instant I fell in love with her.  I don't know if it would normally bring me any comfort to hear her heart beating in another person's body, but she told me once that in the case of a fatal accident, she hoped they could salvage her organs in time to help someone else live longer.  She was so passionate about it, which makes me think that her gift of love to a complete stranger would somehow bring me solace.

58307	0	a	Hey, I lost my dad last year and we recently met up with a man who received his heart.   The guy my dad's heart saved had a family, a business, and his own full life. It basically have him a new start, and a MASSIVE amount more freedom. He had a long-term heart condition that caused him to be hospitalized for the majority of 5 years before he received the heart. When my dad died, they got some amazing life-saving news. It gives you a small silver lining about losing someone close to you. Even though it was one of the worst times for me, it always helped to think that so many people were being helped, and a few were actually SAVED (he was able to donate multiple organs along with tissue).   I think it's really good that people can see this kind of thing, and know that some happiness can come out of a really horrible experience. I hope you are doing well, and thanks for sharing the story!
58308	0	a	I cannot put myself in your moms shoes.   She must have heard that heartbeat when her daughter was just as tiny as a peanut, while still in the womb.   She held her for the first time when she was just a teeny tiny seven pounds baby.  She must have seen every first - first crawl, first steps, first cry, first giggle, first laugh, first roll over, first words, first day at school and every first and all the other firsts there could have been.   Kyle is a nice guy. Thank you Kyle for making a moms day. I am tearing up at what you did for this mom. Every mom deserves to know her kid is still alive someway in the world.  Edit: thanks for my first silver stranger! It made my whole year!  Edit 1: thank you for the gold and the silver strangers. Love conquers all.

58311	0	a	I am sorry for the loss of your brother and that you've not heard back. It is a delicate scenario. In my heart I accepted the donation as having done the right thing and its what my sister wanted. I have not been in contact with any of the recipients myself. I am just not ready nor am I certain I will ever be. My mother has received wedding pictures from one of the kidney recipients and she shared this one with me today. Have faith your brother made a life saving gift and gave people a chance. The pain of loosing a loved one never goes away but there is a certain level of comfort in knowing life continues. <3
58312	0	a	I was a heart recipient 8 months ago and I’ve been having a hard time getting down to write my letter of gratitude to the donor’s family. Your comment has inspired me to get it done by my next clinic visit. Would hate for them not to have this option.   Your brother is a big part of giving others a second chance at life. He truly lives on. Sending you lots of love.
58313	0	a	Yup. A real “tough guy,” not one who has to try to prove he’s a tough guy to everyone and himself, isn’t afraid of being genuine and showing emotion.
58314	0	a	I hope you are also doing well and thank you for sharing. I never know the words to express what this whole process is like. Its a kaleidoscope of emotion. Hearing from other people who just understand has been very helpful.

58316	0	a	My buddy passed away about 5 years ago. He was an organ donor and donated his heart to a 50 year old woman and a kidney to a child in need.   I noticed I wasn’t an organ donor for some reason. (Prob messed up when I was a dumb 17 year old) but as soon as my buddy’s mom heard her sons heart beat again, I went to the DMV the next day and updated my license to an organ donor.
58317	0	a	Oh man this perspective hit me hard. I think these things are touching but they never got me like they seemed to with some people. Now I understand completely why it matters so much to some people. Earlier today my girlfriend of a few years who I love more than anything was holding me and I could hear her heartbeat. If I ever lost her but her heart was able to save someone, hearing her heart beat again would make me feel things I would never get to feel otherwise.  Thank you. Also screw you though because I'm crying at work.

58326	0	a	A friend of mine rescued a dog as a puppy, maybe 6 months old.   The dog still cries whenever her food bowl is brought out, and she even cries the whole time she’s eating as well.   It’s like she associates food and dinnertime with fear. They help her a lot and let her eat calmly, without any distractions.  They’ve also had her fully checked by their vet to make sure she’s not in physical pain while she eats.   Makes me so sad to think what that baby dog must have gone through to be that scared to eat.

58331	0	a	Before we figured out that my husband wearing shoes made our feral cat afraid to eat her wet food, I would convince her to eat by pretending to eat from her bowl while making loud omnom and slurpy sounds. Then I would pass the bowl to her and she would finally give it a try.  edit-- people have been asking for pictures of our sweet little ginger girl: https://imgur.com/a/oD0s9vg  She bonded with our other kitties first. It took about a year before I was able to pet her. Even when she started snuggling in the crook of my arm, I still wasn't allowed to pet her without getting teefies.
58332	0	a	Same as my boy, Pretzel.  I know he was mistreated as sometimes when I touch the wrong part of his leg/underside he will growl/snap, but I know he doesn't mean it.  He just has bad memories and sad/worried eyes often.  Sometimes he doesn't eat. I made him dog biscuits one time too and he refused to eat them lol. At least I know he always loves schmackos.  He is so delicate and wary when eating, I have to encourage and coddle him.  He was really scared the first time I met him and I basically had to force him in my car. He took some schmackos and just slept the whole ride home, then joined me in my bed when we got home and has never left. He is such a velcro dog and hates being left alone for even a short time. The first and second pictures are him trying to look for me when I went to get the mail, looking out a second story window <3  I was thrift shopping at the animal welfare league and a lady who fostered dogs was delivering dog beds she makes. She was talking about how naughty Pretzel was being, pooping in the house etc and jumping on the bed, but I think she was a little grumpy and being too hard on him. I asked about him ad she even tried to tell me I wouldn't want him. But I ignored her and now we are bonded :D  https://imgur.com/a/QaiMnKE

We found a pair that was ""genuine leather"" and that was the nicest pair they had for under $20.  I bought my first pair of Nikes with my own money when I got a job in high school.

58375	0	a	Yeah I’m kinda confused that this kid’s parents are willing to let a stranger pay for his shoes because $75 is too much, yet he’s already decked out in full Nike which isn’t exactly cheap. Props to the girl for being super generous but this whole thing feels weird 
58376	0	a	That’s fine for basic walking around shoes, but they likely won’t be the same quality for playing games like basketball. Most good basketball shoes cost more due to materials and overall design.   I used to have this same conversation with my mom and skate shoes. Yes I can get ones at target for $25. But when they rip and tear insanely faster than the more expensive shoes and I have to go get another pair of shoes the cost doesn’t end up being much less.   I’m not saying he needed top of the line Lebrons, just that Payless/target shoes aren’t necessarily a better choice because they’re cheaper. 
58377	0	a	I'm trying to be the same way with the stepkid but his friends make it so difficult specially with their parents buying them $150 nikes

58387	0	a	Thing is before he didn't really care he would ask for vans or Converses. Now because his friends got airmax 250 from their parents now he wants them.  I already got him some $80 Adidas. I can perfectly afford to get him $200 sneakers but it's not about him being a good kid, I mean his grades are great, behavior just your typical teenage shit once in a while. But there's no need for $expensive ass sneakers

We all ran out in to the street and no one knew what to do or where to go.  When I made it home, I was glued to the TV, watching these brave men and women try to save anyone they could. I cannot imagine being in their shoes, running in to peril without a second thought for their own safety. They were the first sign that, despite the horror, the U.S. would fight back and do it's best to protect us. I have a long history of opposition to our government, but I will never have anything but respect and awe for first responders.

I hopped into the back and there were at least 10 ppl sitting down with water, sweaty and disheveled waiting to get home too.

This man was a big strong man - line coach for the football team - and could tower over you. In a somber tone, he said, ""You're living it today."" The 11th & 12th we watched the news.  When I got home from school, my dad was frozen watching CNN. I asked him what's wrong, and he reaches out for me. I sit beside him and as he puts an arm around me he says, ""Your brother's generation had the Challenget. Yours will have this.""

All the friends who were with me didn’t notice it, but they had a small display there. A hidden projector was cycling through scans of missing persons posters, and right as I get close enough to read them a new one pops up. A picture of a man, smiling at the camera, poorly centered on a piece of white paper. On the bottom, in shaky uneven writing that looked like crayon, it said ‘Have you seen my dad.’ Needless to say, everyone found the quiet backwoods guy crying on a bench with his head in his hands.

58404	0	a	I am 17 years old, a senior in high school. I was in the womb when 9/11 occured. Most of my classmates were either also in the womb or not yet conceived when it occured.  An entire generation has grown up knowing nothing but the aftermath. Experiencing fear. Taking your shoes off in airports. Even racism and prejudice, if they happened to be Muslim or even just having dark skin.  Not to mention war. A lot of my classmates didn't even know we were at war until they were told, and this war has been going on their entire lives.  I hope within my lifetime 9/11 stops being so painful, an inhibitor, and instead we use the tragedy to grow, past it and beyond, as a society and planet, towards a more progressive and safer future. I really do.

The whole event was incredibly powerful -- the silence in which the firefighters went up and down the stairs was truly something to behold.   Edit: Fr.

58412	0	a	"Heroes were made and lost that day.   Guys like [Rick Rescorla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rescorla) and emergency crews who ran into those buildings, knowing what *could* happen. Rick had planned for this, jets hitting the towers, and saved ~~2,300~~ 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees that day.   >At 8:46 a.m. on the morning of September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center (Tower 1). Rescorla heard the explosion and saw the tower burning from his office window in the 44th floor of the South Tower (Tower 2). When a Port Authority announcement came over the P.A. system urging people to stay at their desks, Rescorla ignored the announcement, grabbed his bullhorn, walkie-talkie, and cell phone, and began systematically ordering Morgan Stanley employees to evacuate, including the 1,000 employees in WTC 5. He directed people down a stairwell from the 44th floor, continuing to calm employees after the building lurched violently following the crash of United Airlines Flight 175 38 floors above into Tower 2 at 9:03 A.M. Morgan Stanley executive Bill McMahon stated that even a group of 250 people visiting the offices for a stockbroker training class knew what to do because they had been shown the nearest stairway.  >Rescorla had boosted morale among his men in Vietnam by singing Cornish songs from his youth, and now he did the same in the stairwell, singing songs like one based on the Welsh song ""Men of Harlech"":  >""Men of Cornwall stop your dreaming, Can’t you see their spearpoints gleaming?,  >See their warriors’ pennants streaming, To this battlefield.  >Men of Cornwall stand ye steady, It cannot be ever said ye for the battle were not ready  >Stand and never yield!""[3]  >Between songs, Rescorla called his wife, telling her, ""Stop crying. I have to get these people out safely. If something should happen to me, I want you to know I've never been happier. You made my life."" After successfully evacuating most of Morgan Stanley's 2,687 employees, he went back into the building.[3][11][12] When one of his colleagues told him he too had to evacuate the World Trade Center, Rescorla replied, ""As soon as I make sure everyone else is out.""[13] He was last seen on the 10th floor, heading upward, shortly before the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 A.M. His remains were never found.[10][11][12] Rescorla was declared dead three weeks after the attacks.[3]  ""You see, for Rick Rescorla, this was a natural death. People like Rick, they don’t die old men. They aren’t destined for that and it isn’t right for them to do so. It just isn’t right, by God, for them to become feeble, old, and helpless sons of bitches. There are certain men born in this world, and they’re supposed to die setting an example for the rest of the weak bastards we’re surrounded with.”   \- Dan Hill, Rescorla's best friend  and fellow Vietnam vet  https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/02/11/the-real-heroes-are-dead  Edit: Thanks /u/NmClark93 for telling me, [just today Rick received the Presidential Citizens Medal for his bravery on 9/11](https://www.nj.com/news/2019/09/trump-to-give-late-nj-911-hero-the-presidential-citizens-medal.html)  Edit2: [This is one the songs Rick was singing in the stairwell.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRtnWVvDX6k)"

Practicing lockdown drills, going to war for something we don't remember happening, the fearmongering and near daily tragedy and terrorism that we just mumble ""aw, not again!"" at.   We even make memes and jokes about those tragedies because we're so desensitized to all the bloodshed that there's no horror or pain left to feel. Just humor.  I think the goal of commiting 9/11 wasn't to break some buildings. I think the goal was to CAUSE that fearmongering, to stain entire generations with it. To make an ever present fear of the next bombing or shooting or mass death. To further desensitize us so the next hit doesn't have as much backlash.  It's awful. I want my children and everyone else's children to not just say ""aw man, again?"" when something bad happens.  And I think a lot of my peers feel the same about that.  Change is inevitably coming with my generation as we get older and enter positions of power. I know it, and I just hope we can be effective in that."

58420	0	a	What's great to me is that emergency preparedness is something a lot of people can engage in and it can really make a difference. And at the very bottom, it's just humans looking out for other humans. Make sure you have some extra supplies for yourself and anyone else that might be in need nearby you. Try to be a calm fixture for other people because panic does not lead to solutions.

58422	0	a	There was a similar story in West London where a drill rapper called Sav12 chased down a guy who kidnapped a girl for 20 minutes on his motorbike and ended up saving her. Takes a different kind of dedication when you're a 15 year old on a bike though but thought I'd mention it since they're similar stories, click [here if you want to read an actual news source](https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/sav-12-saves-girl-drill-rapper/).
58423	0	a	This kid chased down a man named Harold Herr who was paroled after serving 20 years for kidnapping and raping a young girl in ‘89. Back then the girl was outside her home playing with her younger brother and one of their friends, just riding tricycles up and down the sidewalk. He beckoned the girl over and she approached the van. He reached out and yanked her through the window before speeding off, taking her to a secluded field, raping her, and abandoning her there. She was recovered later that day by the police and returned to her family.  That was my sister and I was left on the tricycle wondering where she went.  This kid saved some girl and her family from unimaginable pain. I know his story went to shit later, but he’s still a hero to me.

A lot are good people just trying to get out of it doing what they have to do.  Source: lived in the blocks, seen alot of shit, managed to get out.

58434	0	a	I would generally say yeah. Something like that takes a toll and some wounds never fully heal, but overall I’d say we’ve all done incredibly well considering.   My sister, his first victim, is married and has the sweetest little daughter of her own. I don’t talk to her about the incident though. I don’t want to open up any wounds of hers that have healed, and I figure if she wants to hash it out she’ll bring it up.  I’m definitely the nervous one when my wife and I take our kids out. I have a tendency to look over my shoulder more than she does, but I don’t feel like it disrupts my life any more than the average cautious parent.  I don’t know how my parents worked through it. I was young at the time and our conversations about it have been brief over the years. When those boys chased him down it opened up conversation that had been buried for years. I saw my mom look like she was gonna vomit when she had to say the name Harold Herr again. I can’t imagine the rage I would feel if someone did that to one of my kids.
58435	0	a	It's stories like this that remind me to judge people as I see them, not dig through their past. Most of my friends who have done time aren't bad people, just desperate.

58436	0	a	I preach inside the county jails. Most of the guys in there are overall decent people who have made a few bad choices.   I am a huge advocate for banning the use of criminal record as a reason for denying employment unless it directly impacts the job (financial crime working in banking, child molester working with kids, etc). People make mistakes, serve their time, and then when they get out are unable to find work to take care of themselves so end up doing more crime. Vicious cycle.

58453	0	a	*I* did that, about 25 years ago. About 70% of my co-workers smoked, when they took smoke breaks, I took a break too. The manager asked me why, I told him, he said, “but you don’t smoke!”  I said I would pretend to smoke. He let it go. 
58454	0	a	I just picked up a smoking habit and joined the fuckers. That'll show management.
58455	0	a	I'm amazed that companies don't have scheduled breaks. In my industry(welding/fab shop) smokers don't get more breaks than non smokers. We all have scheduled breaks(two, 5 minute breaks and a 20 minute lunch). Smokers don't have the luxury of just walking off to smoke. Pretty simple.

58458	0	a	When I was working behind a food counter, we literally couldn't take smoke breaks with the smokers because if we did there would be no one to help the customers. It slowed our productivity down so much, because there's so much prep work that needs to be done or it slows the service... so the prep work sits there undone while the non-smokers futilely try to handle the growing line of people.   And then taking breaks when there were no customers around got me dirty looks from the smokers. Go figure.

58464	0	a	Possibly illegal depending on state law, but reasonable, yes.  I think expecting that you'll be able to stop working to smoke when you're not on an official break is the unreasonable attitude here.
58465	0	a	When I worked as a server, we had scheduled breaks. The smokers would go have additional breaks whenever the hell they wanted. It was only supposed to be 5 minutes but they often took 15 or longer.
58466	0	a	Sounds like bad management 
58467	0	a	Look at the pic
58468	0	a	Are there laws protecting smokers?
58469	0	a	Our smokers had to sign out every time they left to take a smoke break. Meant they usually had to work 20-30min longer than everybody else if they wanted to take their mandatory 30min break as well. Some actually stopped smoking because of this policy, others took the hit and just stayed at work 30min longer so they could take their smoke breaks. Basically staying almost 10h a month longer at work. Even if it's time spent taking a break, that's not worth it to me. Germany btw in case anyone wonders (30min break mandatory if you work 6h a day, 1h if it's 10h a day, breaks can be taken whenever you want and can be split up as you wish)
58470	0	a	How would that be illegal (in whatever applicable state)?  I’m genuinely curious.
58471	0	a	Not as far as I know. I believe companies have no obligation to give their employees smoke breaks.
58472	0	a	Pretty sure it's not illegal. Most states only require a 30 min meal break if they work more than 5 consecutive hours. Could easily be misunderstanding something though, I have zero legal experience.   [Source](https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/meal.htm)
58473	0	a	This is correct. When I was a smoker I've worked at places where you only get the normal mandatory breaks, but I've also worked at places where I could smoke every hour 
58474	0	a	I used to run retail stores in high traffic cities. On my first day at a new company my assistant manager went outside for no less than 40 minutes during her shift to smoke multiple times. I told her she can’t use her time as liberally anymore and it’s unfair to the non smokers. She threw a fit and called HR. I demonstrated how much time she was stealing from the company and she ended up on the short end of things. The employer has no obligation to let you smoke other than the laws about breaks.
58475	0	a	My first job they were allowed a smoke break every hour. Every job ive had since then you could only smoke on legally mandatory breaks and some places even said you cant smoke on your paid breaks only on your unpaid lunch break. 
58476	0	a	It still blows my mind that a sizeable percentage of the population has a drug addiction where they need to take a break every few hours to get a fix. It's just so... normalized.

58517	0	a	I make a point to stop every time I see someone stranded, especially when my kids are in the car with me.  I once had the opposite of this scenario - I drove by some amigos trying to jack up a large truck with a flat and I noticed stones piled on top of the jack.  It was too small to get the wheels off the ground.  I pulled over, and they spoke zero English, so we 'spoke' through hand gestures, but was able to let them know I can help.  Drove home, got my jack, drove back, and got their truck up high enough to change the tire.    They were all smiling, so grateful, patting me on the back...and pulled out a cooler to offer me a cold gatorade.    It feels good to help people.  
58518	0	a	Tip: Loosen the nuts before jacking the car up. Use your foot instead of your hand as then you use your body weight to your advantage. This also prevents the tire from spinning as it would when you jack it up.

Super tight nuts/lugs bring other issues like stretched fasteners, warped disks, cracks, stripped threads, etc.  The guy changing tires usually doesn’t give a fuck and gives it 50 Ugga Duggas with the impact set to nuclear fusion

If all you do is complain of course your gonna be miserable, right?  Well I started out donating blood and doing some local clean ups.  Because I was broke .  But it was a gateway drug.  5 years later I ended up becoming a volunteer firefighter.  So that shit gets out of hand.

Far from being ashamed, we ought to rejoice in both the affirmation of our capacity to change, as well as our ability to course-correct.   It's the worst of us who stick on one singular course their whole life out of fear and lack of imagination and stubborn unwillingness to change.  Nothing is so pitiable as a static, wooden man.  What a thrill, to know you have seen the depths of hate, anger and ignorance, and climbed *out* of those depths, become better, become something new.  Few of us choose hate; most of us have hate thrust upon us unwilling, and no one ought to feel ashamed of that.  It is done to us; we grow up seeing hate, feeling hate, being told to hate, and we are social beings; we do what we see, what we're told to do.  One may avoid such indoctrination when they're young only to have tragedy and trauma afflict them with it later in life, in one fashion or another. There is no shame in passing through that trial, in having that illness - for that is what hate is, an illness - there is only sadness for the ones who cannot escape and the highest of praise to those who do.  Those who overcome.  When I remodel a room in my house, I often feel a sense of loss and sadness when the room is finally finished.  It's much better than it was before, true; but the joy of building anew, the joy of the *process* of making something better than it was, of splaying out the infinite possibilities of change and alteration and having the infinite freedom of choosing a new direction - that is something people ought really to appreciate.  There is more joy in that, I think, than just in sitting in a very nice room.   And luckily, the best thing about us is that we are never finished; we always have room to improve, and the joy of that process needs never end until the final end.

My father, who loves the Lord of the Rings, used to say that Middle Earth would have been plunged into darkness if The Shire was filled with its current residents and not Frodo, would also fail if it were all Frodos, but would have found easier success if there were only a few more Samwises.

Cut to a month ago after I bought a new car; honked at someone who almost hit my car. They pulled up next to me and tried to fight me at a red light [like if I had forced them to sit through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf8GaX_lrL4). After ignoring him he spat at and then threw something at my car before running a red light resulting in him totaling his car and damaging 3 others. I miss my 2nd gentle honk.

58636	0	a	I wish I thought of this while in uni.
58637	0	a	We did this in my medical school. Made a massive google doc with people. We would then also insert jokes for fun or a way to help memorize a certain topic. We would even highlight points that the professor made sure we knew for the test!
58638	0	a	"Google Docs is so nice and is great way to collectively study and share ideas/questions! Used it all the time in college! The only problem is a lot of times you have those shmucks who believe everything is a competition and refuse to partake or choose to ""leave out"" certain important information so that they can gain some sort of advantage over others. "
58639	0	a	This is actually awesome, especially since I'm so slow at taking notes :/
58640	0	a	Me and my friends do this, but it usually just dissolves into making jokes and fucking around. Useful for passing class time, at least.
58641	0	a	It sounds nice, but I don't know how they could take notes simultaneously in the same document? Not from a technical point, I get how google doc works, but I imagine someone (even more someones, like ten people at the same time) writing similar sentences at the same time as I am? It would get so confusing. And other students seeing the parts that are confusing and explaining in real time? Then they'd miss the next part of the lecture, no?  Currently at Uni, and while it sounds really nice and I think google docs is great for group projects or fill in gaps in the script after the lecture, I can't imagine this working the way it is described. Has anybody here tried this?
58642	0	a	Thanks I'll bring this up with my group project and a few classmates.  Might be useful.
58643	0	a	"I bet there was one kid that didn't do the work on this ""group project"". "
58644	0	a	I thought of this, but all of my friends are like “ sorry fam, but I haven't study yet” until the exams are over and they all got As. Welp
58645	0	a	I wish I had solid hard working friends who could help me achieve this at uni. 
58646	0	a	We did and it was incredible. We would take notes in group and divide tasks: Someone write, someone fix the layout, someone draw that schematics and someone proof read.  We even managed to keep up with some really fast professors who get out of room so quickly it was nearly impossible to get complete notes before they got erased.
58647	0	a	Explaining in realtime with text while the lecture is ongoing? Yeah, that's not going to work as well you might think.
58648	0	a	One of our mneumonics for the antebrachial muscles is “everyones a mother fucker except u”  Do you have any to share
58649	0	a	I just experienced something like this last week. We were taking an exam and the prof had two different versions of it (50 multiple choice or 30 with some short answer). Turns out about half of the 50 multiple choice questions exams were missing multiple questions due to a misprint. Anyway we spent 30 mins next class figuring out how to fix the mistake so everything was “fair.” You wouldn’t believe how many people got upset when our solution became “just give everybody 100%”
58650	0	a	I really want to do this, but all my math and science classes the professors are really strict about taking notes on paper, and no computers in class :|
58651	0	a	We do this with facebook messenger, just a group chat with memes and making jokes.
58652	0	a	More than likely there are assigned roles in the note taking.  One person might be able to type really fast, and just types the lecture. While others take other notes, like what is written on the board, or add other pertinent information.  Given the nature of the document being always online, others can add stuff later, and answer/pose questions.  I would imagine this document is a smaller group of students, or it is a smaller class, probably a higher level course as well, as the free loaders would be weeded out already.
58653	0	a	More likely there's one kid who takes great notes and this is the ploy the others are using so they don't have to. 
58654	0	a	I wish I have friends to do this in Uni. 
58655	0	a	Truth is, college is partially a competition and if this really did happen it was an anomaly. There would be plenty of kids not contributing and coasting off of the team effort who didn’t deserve it. This is utopian or a very close group of a few friends.

58660	0	a	I did this back in high school in a group of 6 in one of my history classes, we would assign sections to people. Everyone else would correct and add things to sections if needed. Questions can be asked via google docs comment feature. The bottom of the document was always for off topic stuff. We basically just used it so half of us could goof off and not pay attention knowing we had notes if needed. We didn't really have trouble rotating through note taking duties luckily.

58665	0	a	We all got 100% thank goodness. The professor ended up saying something like “if you *really* want the grade you got then just let me know.” Still couldn’t believe that people got upset over that...Jesus it’s a college level course just take the easy grade.
58666	0	a	I mean the school’s intro science and math classes all suck dick.  Fucking college algebra test on quadratic equations had 18 problems with a -b, and the teacher only spent like 2 seconds on what to do with imaginary numbers.  And then none of the squares went out evenly. (Teacher made the test herself, it felt like she typed out random numbers).  Life Pro Tip: if a college is associated with a religion, a lot of the professors will have been picked because of their faith instead of credentials.  Edit: this doesn’t really make a difference 98% of the time, but the 2% really shines.

58701	0	a	"(didn't see the video)  It's very true.  My dear friend lost her baby last year, and I made her and her husband a memorial video out of the short videos they took of her short little life.  One of them included Mommy and a hospital volunteer singing Stevie Wonder's ""Isn't She Lovely?"" to baby, so that became the theme song of the entire video (I had them start it, and it faded into SW singing it throughout the rest of the video).  A few months back it played on the radio, so I sent her a text letting her know that I heard the song and thought of her baby, and she responded back saying she sometimes worried that people would forget about her baby.  I told her that there's at least one other person out there that thinks of her baby almost daily, and that's me."

58716	0	a	I had this app for awhile. I was never fast enough to answer the call when it came in. Now I see why. The volunteer number is huge in comparison. I’m glad to see so many are out there willing to help. 
58717	0	a	It’s a wonderful app! A blind man video called me one day to ask me to explain the app to his new caregivers and also blind roommate. It was so neat!!
58718	0	a	Do they sort requests by the type of help someone needs?  I dont have the best fashion sense, if someone called me asking which shirt looks best I would be worried about choosing wrong.  I feel like I would be able to help with more objective problems with 100% confidence though.
58719	0	a	"Wow, this is si much of a ""Human Being Bros"" type thing! I joined and according to the stats I see on the app, you motivated over 400 people! What a wonderful community! "
58720	0	a	PSA: If you speak more than one language - definitely sign up for this because I'm willing to bet they need people that speak things other than english.
58721	0	a	I first fkund out about this app years ago when it was only available for iOS(android here), and was deeply upset i wasn't able to use it. I'd be checking every couple of weeks until i forgot about it... It's so great knowing they've made it so far! Just joined
58722	0	a	I’ve answered 4 calls with Be my Eyes!! It’s the best and I encourage everyone to do it.  Takes a little while to get your first notification, but it’s well worth the wait!  I’ve helped people pick out dresses for special events, look at school work and notes their kids bring home, check mail and packages...feels so awesome to help out!
58723	0	a	I am a Lyft driver and I assisted a blind passenger on getting home the other day and she was ranting and raving about this like no other. It made me so happy.. definitely have thought about giving this go. I love the idea for it. There is also the same concept but for deaf people and they have a translator that will FaceTime the deaf person and translate what the caller is saying. Unfortunately forgot the name of that one but it is great! 
58724	0	a	Oh hey thanks Mods!!! I’m really glad I could get the word out about this great app, I really hope it takes off like it deserves to! 
58725	0	a	OP, I had no idea how existed until now. Thank you for sharing, this is just incredible.
58726	0	a	I have had this app for MONTHS and I have gotten two calls, and both were pleasant and wonderful experiences. One was checking the expiry on a cold medication bottle and the other was checking to see if they had a certain spice. 
58727	0	a	Awww shit... downloaded the app, subscribed and I was scrolling through the comments as I wait for someone to call when I read yours and remember I'm color blind. Fuck.
58728	0	a	OP Please, is it possibleto help through text/voice messages without *ACTUALYY* calling? 
58729	0	a	"Until I read this comment my thoughts were ""what fucking idiot thought that made sense"", guess I'm the idiot."
58730	0	a	Isn’t it such a great experience??? And it’s nice knowing that if you don’t pick up, someone will 
58731	0	a	Wow thank you so much for doing it. It’s SO rewarding 
58732	0	a	What kind of things do you do to help them?
58733	0	a	Yes do it!!! You probably won’t get a call for a while but it’s really cool when you do! 
58734	0	a	It's a really neat idea and I always have fun when called - most frequent it's to check expiration dates or ingredient labels. Makes you wonder what else we sighted people take for granted. 
58735	0	a	Can you have her thank him? I know that’s weird but if she can I’d love for him to know how much I appreciate the concept!!! And I appreciate kind people who make life easier for others. 
58736	0	a	Omg I love that show much!!! I bet that person was really excited to hear what the invitation said!!! 
58737	0	a	Everyone I’ve talked to has been AWESOME! 
58738	0	a	I HOPE SO WOW
58739	0	a	It's up about 10k volunteers since it was posted!
58740	0	a	I’m so glad I was able to direct him towards it!!! Tell him that the volunteers are overwhelming the app so if he wants to sign up buddies he should! 
58741	0	a	He wasn't lying when he said he can't see shit.  Edit: I got me some gold. Ain't that some shit. Thank you kind stranger!
58742	0	a	Every time I open the app and see that number I tear up a little 
58743	0	a	1,889,304 now... in 11 minutes 54 people joined.. this is awesome  
58744	0	a	Nope! It’s literally just, “hey I really want to wear a blue sweater, is this sweater blue?”   It’s really just little things like that. You’re not providing life advice or anything, you’re just helping them clarify things! 
58745	0	a	I love that they didn't trust the kids to tell them what the school work and notes said. Like sure mom, it says A++++, no homework today or ever in fact.
58746	0	a	I don’t remember where I found it (maybe twitter???) but it’s great!!! And they’ll email you really fun stories every now and then. You’re welcome, feel free to pass it on! I made my mom and boyfriend download it :) 
58747	0	a	Blind leading the blinder. 
58748	0	a	It’s a video chat that you answer! You have to be able to see what they need help with and audibly respond in real time. I don’t think your end of the video chat pops up though, I think you only see their screen 
58749	0	a	Failing to see the practicality in something does not make you an idiot. When your perspective changes to where you can understand a different point of view, see that practicality, and recognize it, you’ve actually grown as a person.   Way to grow!
58750	0	a	Yup! It’s just an all-around feel good app. I love that it exists. I just wish more people who needed it used it and that I received more calls to help!
58751	0	a	Thank you for introducing us to this awesome app.
58752	0	a	Mostly helping out with the spice shelf while cooking and narrating porn
58753	0	a	~~omg this is great.  I know limited asl too AWESOME~~  I went full retard
58754	0	a	I’ve been a volunteer for a while, and have missed a few calls, one because I get caught off guard by the notification, and two because the calls are quick to be answered.   I got to answer my first one the other day! I helped a lady with instructions for making brownies! She was very nice, and I was happy I was able to help out. This is a very cool app. 
58755	0	a	> Makes you wonder what else we sighted people take for granted.  Vision, I imagine. 
58756	0	a	I got a call from a blind woman who could figure out    1. If her stove was one    2. If it was on how to turn it off    The stove had flat buttons instead of a dial or physical buttons. She said she smelled burning, but wasn’t sure.     The stove was on and I had to walk her through finding the right buttons. I realized a lot of the words I used as descriptions really didn’t mean much to her because she didn’t have context for it. I had to explain things as if I was the one feeling it. For example: there was a ridge around where the buttons were held and I had to explain what that would feel like so she knew she was in the right space.     I never realized how unfriendly modern stoves were to the blind.
58757	0	a	Yes this. Please thank the guy on our behalf. I had this caller who was so thankful for this app. Please pass on the message. 
58758	0	a	"This looks so cool. Are the calls random?! Do you get ""regulars""?? "

58766	0	a	lol  - i almost died because i was in mid-drink. 
58767	0	a	I’m hijacking here, my husband is legally blind (zero vision in one eye and very little in the other, with very little perception of color) and that stubborn fucker doesn’t ask for help enough, but I am over the moon to see all of the love and eagerness to help.  Thank you, sincerely.  Vision issues can make people feel very...alone.  This makes me feel the opposite of that.  We got him signed up, he actually really is happy and excited about the idea.  It helped quite a bit that I was able to tell him how stoked everyone on Reddit was to help.  THANK YOU!  :)
58768	0	a	ah fuck i'm retarded 
58769	0	a	Can you please tell him that it’s a joy to help? Please. I suffer from really severe depression and I often feel guilty about not doing enough to help others (hard to do volunteer work when you can’t drag yourself out of bed) and the chance to do little things like this really helps me. Everyone has SOMETHING, there’s no shame in asking for help and if it helps others...even better. 
58770	0	a	I hope you are getting treatment for your depression and that things get a little better for you soon. I have severe depression too so I get it 
58771	0	a	I am! I’m gonna be okay, I just have to be gentle with myself. And you too. Show yourself some mercy, it’s not easy to live in a brain that wants to harm you. 
58772	0	a	Brake light switch. Fairly simple to replace. Even if it doesn't work it's easy to do. 
58773	0	a	Had similar experience several years ago.  I was driving on I-40 heading to Knoxville from North Carolina and my car's alternator belt blew. I was stranded in the middle of nowhere and this was before cell phones were a thing.  I waved to passing truckers to call for help and pretty soon, a cop shows up.  We talk for a few minutes and explain that I'm a poor student on my way back to college.  He gives me a ride to the next exit to find a repair shop.  He talked to them and when he heard what they would charge, he paid for a new belt and we got back in his car and drove back. Side note: this part was great. We were flying down the interstate! We get to talking and tell him my father is a retired policeman. It's getting dark at this point. On the side of the interstate, he busts out his personal toolbox he keeps in his patrol car and fixes my car under the flood lights on his car.  Once I'm up and running again, I asked for his info so I could send him some money for the belt and help. He refused and gave me a patch from his department.  All he asked was that I mail him one from my father's department in return.  Greatest guy ever.  I'll never forget that. I wish more people could experience police in this way.  Most of them are.
58774	0	a	Was he able to fix it?

58788	0	a	I got pulled over on Sunday for an expired registration. My mom cosigned on the car with me, so all the relevant mail is in her name. Unfortunately, she has a habit of throwing mail away when she doesn't know what it is, instead of you know, opening it. So she threw away the letter reminding us to renew.  Aanyways, the officer could've just had me towed in the rain, but instead she walked me step by step on how to renew a registration on my phone. Super patient about the whole thing.
58789	0	a	Happens a lot.  Overcharging for lack of knowledge. Had a buddy that was going to pay $150 to replace a headlight. Sent him to the store and told him how to look up what he needs. $20 later he shows up with a little box and doesn't think it's right. Took two minutes to change it out and he was good to go.
58790	0	a	Yes, I did.  It was the least I could do.
58791	0	a	Asking the real questions.
58792	0	a	This was a cliffhanger for working men.
58793	0	a	But all GEMINIs are for sure.
58794	0	a	Protect and serve was viewed as a verbal legal loophole. Good cops are still good and the mission statement of most departments is still to keep the public safe.
58795	0	a	I took my wife's car into the Ford dealer because it was basically dead.  They told me the alternator was dying and it was going to cost $800 to replace.   I found a refurbished one for $100 bucks and watched youtube to install it myself.  Took me an hour to do.  
58796	0	a	Yeah, it’s not really “sad.” What’s sad is how many Redditors pretend they know what they’re talking.   They’re not legally required to protect you, and that is for a valid legal reason a lot of people do not understand. It creates a hazardous precedent of unnecessary lawsuits. Example: Police respond to an active shooter in a shopping mall, they hear where the gunfire is coming from and respond. You’re sitting in the corner with a bullet in your leg crying and asking for help, but their main goal is to stop the threat before more victims pile up so they walk past you. If they were legally required to protect you, you would then claim they were negligent and attempt to file a lawsuit. In reality pertaining to public safety and law enforcement, you were not important then because more people were likely getting shot. That’s an extreme example but here's a more realistic one: all of the city's officers are tied up on high priority calls and you call 911 to report a large tire in the roadway. That is indeed a traffic hazard that needs addressed, but unfortunately at the moment it won't happen because they're busy dealing with some dude who beat the shit out of his wife and another guy who has two felony warrants. Five minutes later it causes a fatal accident and then the family of the deceased driver will attempt to sue the police department for not protecting them. Let's make it more realistic: you call 911 on somebody who was being belligerent in your mom n' pop ice cream shop. In the three-five minutes it takes the police to get there (which is a great response time), he punches you and breaks your nose. You make the argument that the police didn't respond fast enough and it was their fault you have a broken nose, you take them to court. Even the legal system realizes that it's physically impossible for the police to protect everybody in all circumstances. It just isn't realistic.  Well, what else is the big deal? The city pays for that attorney to represent the police department. If this happened all the time for every event people (especially the same folks complaining about how they’re not required to protect you) would be bitching about their tax dollars being spent on court appearances for cops. Not to mention a lot of cities are underfunded as it is.  The other thing is that the police protects and serves society as a whole, not individuals or “you.”  That kind of makes me think, though. They’re not required to protect you, but they choose to do so anyways and that can be observed over and over again. The city is not required to fix that pothole but if they’re going to get money to do so and feel like making your life easier they will. Not the soundest analogy but it makes my point.

Think about all the times a bride and groom probably had a fight on their big night.  Or all the times something went horrifically wrong and the wedding was broken off during the reception.

Starts coming towards him, the dad is directing his attention to the son, not himself. And you can see the genuine happiness he has, not because what he got, but because his son experienced something meaningful and special.   That's a dad I can respect - and one his son will hopefully appreciate for years to come.   Edit: typos"

58906	0	a	I can sit and reminisce about when I was excited as a child, but honestly as a Dad now watching my young get excited brings me more pure joy than anything I have ever experienced in my life. This video brings me joy for this kid, and for his Dad.

58915	0	a	Reminds me of when I took my nine-year-old nephew to see the second Hunger Games movie. it was rated M, and his mum had given permission for him to see it (he'd read the books already too).   It was his first time seeing an M rated movie, and I had told him that if it was too scary he could let me know and we'd leave whenever he wanted. There was a swear word in the film and he was amazed ('Did they say a bad word?!?' LOL).  But near the end, during a 'scary' bit, he got too scared and asked to leave, so we did. As we were heading back to the car he says 'I think I'll just stick to PG from now on'. Bless. So adorable.

58923	0	a	"It's beautiful.   When I was about the same age my big brother took me to my first concert. He bought a rose from a vendor and tried to convince me to walk up to the stage with it. I was scared to death, sure I was going to get arrested or something. After a lotta pump up talk from him, I gathered my courage and started walking down the aisle.  He told me that he couldn't go with me because security would stop him, but not a young girl. I looked back and he was standing in the aisle just watching. The guards closest to the stage told me I could lay it on the stage but couldn't give it to any band members. I set it down, turned around and literally ran back to my brother. He grabbed me in the biggest hug and was screaming, ""Did you see that?!? He was trying to say thank you!!""  Apparently, as soon as I turned to run, Randy Owen picked up the rose while singing and held it out pointing to me, the lone little kid running in the auditorium. I missed it.  He said the crowd went pretty wild, but I didn't hear anything but my heartbeat.   All that's to say, it wouldn't have mattered if I'd seen it or not, the best part of the memory is how much my brother wanted to see me happy and how he boosted my courage to get there. Awesome night. "

58954	0	a	I’ve learned this while in college, where everyone is broke, that the people with so little give so much.   She may only be able to give this dog a little piece of clothing, but to the dog that meant the world and is exactly what he needed in that moment of time. It’s nice to think that a single act of kindness like this, so genuine and pure, can inspire others to do the same. I know the dog can’t talk, but I like to think that this video was posted in the hopes to help others see that no kind act goes unforgotten.   Maybe I’m on a soap box this morning and am reading too much into this like my old English teacher, but I recall a time I felt alone like that dog, in a world that didn’t care about me. Metaphorically, I felt that constant rain cloud over me too. It just took my now ex, one moment of,”It’s going to be okay” or my friends one second to text me and go,”Do you want to grab lunch?” so I didn’t have to feel alone or without any love in the world. I’m glad I get to start my 2019 with this video and to be reminded now that I’m better, to give a “little scarf” to someone in need today. It only take a moment to change how someone feels. It’s free, to be kind & caring and free to help others who are struggling.

58965	0	a	Well that made me sad.  Poor thing.   We just rescued a cat that was dumped in a farm field.   Cat stayed in the same spot for 4 days in freezing temps.  I thought it was odd it was in the same spot.   My wife got out after we ran some errands.   It wanted to run from her but didn’t have the energy.  Got in the car, and went straight to the spare food we keep in the car.  The vet noticed all of its cuts and scrapes.  Thinks it was tossed out of a moving vehicle.  I now have 5 rescued cats....  
58966	0	a	If you were broke as shit and there were hundreds of strays in the area you lived in, yes, there is a way you could leave without the dog.
58967	0	a	My dog will stand beside his bed and look at us and back to his bed over and over until we hold up the blanket for him to get underneath.
58968	0	a	I want this more than the scarf. 
58969	0	a	It’s cultural. By contrast, in some villages in Central America they will occasionally put out poison to control the population.

58973	0	a	My dogs do this, but on our bed!  They will scratch at the top edge and then look at me until I lift it up.  Then they cuddle up against me under the covers until they get too hot and come out.  I love it!  Only me though, not my husband.  He gets sad.

58975	0	a	Studied abroad in turkey and almost got attacked by a group of feral dogs until a Turkish man with long hair came up and started barking at the dogs. He said in broken English “bark loud, dogs run”. If you read this, I thank you kind sir. 
58976	0	a	"Well, there's a logical and reasonable limit. In rural areas where dogs get dumped a lot if the population rises high enough they start forming packs that attack pets, small livestock and even children. There are some places so afraid of this they have no tolerance for strays, but most places have a ""I think we're starting to get too many"" sort of mentality."
58977	0	a	Well the difference is if you would call them stray dogs, or wild dogs. Wild dogs will eat your face given the chance. 
58978	0	a	In The Appalachia mountains it’s not uncommon for people to not fix their pets, let them have pups/kittens and then leave them out in the cold or tie them in a bag and toss it in a river...  it’s awful... 
58979	0	a	I guess he could lay on top of it on the same spot too which would probably be even better in regards to insulation.   But yeah, it was pretty selfless, she just gave up on her scarf so the dog could have a little bit more comfort.
58980	0	a	Probably the same as in Greece - they tag em, immunize them, neuter them then turn them loose rather than slaughter them in shelters. Seems more humane to me. 
58981	0	a	My dog did this as well, as soon as I'd lift the blanket she'd bolt under the covers, curl up between my legs and use my butt as a pillow since I sleep on my stomach. My ex got her in the breakup and for a while I'd put a pillow between my legs when I slept because I missed her.
58982	0	a	Maybe he had a childhood dog that did this. I did, he was the best. We were like some sort of Huck Finn dynamic duo of running around like pork chops, farting, and being generally rambunctious 
58983	0	a	Yeah, someone misunderstood the post. We're not out here giving out free scarves to every harry, dick, and tom.
58984	0	a	Thanks for the advice! My next dog will be a rescue but I'm holding off for a bit. Letting my ex have the dog was my decision because at the time of our breakup I was steering hard into addiction, knew it was going to get exponentially worse after the breakup, and was afraid that if I ended up dead that my dog wouldn't be cared for since I'd be living alone. As much as I miss her I am glad I had enough of a sound mind to let her go at that time.  3 years later and I'm in a much better place and VERY excited to get a dog again.

But just because you're old and doing something extremely kind for someone doesn't mean he wasn't potentially speeding. Old people cause serious accidents all the time. Getting a slap on the wrist because you're old only puts more people at risk. Not trying to be a dick, but imagine anyone else saying ""I dont speed, and I don't drive much"" as their defense. I wasn't there when he got a ticket or in that courtroom, so if that's what the judge says is fair, game on. But old people getting off the hook because they're old is terrifying to me."

58996	0	a	This is not human being bros, even if he's old, dude was clocked going way too fast and putting other people and their familyin danger. This is what's fucked up with America, why is he having to drive his 63 year old son to cancer treatments? That should never be a thing.

I do know they have a TV show too but I'm not quite sure what channel.
59001	0	a	It’s always Judge Caprio.  Not saying that he’s the only good judge out there, but he’s definitely gotten a lot of exposure over the past couple of years.
59002	0	a	They’re out there. They just don’t get the headlines. I feel like this is the same judge who dismissed a case against a veteran too. He looks familiar.
59003	0	a	Seriously. The thought of this man having to take care of his ill son at 96 makes my heart break. Not only is he in pain watching his own son suffer but he has to put himself and others in danger at his age to get him to the damn doctor.

I hope he wasn’t going to fast. This judge I think just has more humanity than like 90% of them out there.
59005	0	a	He’s not a rapist
59006	0	a	Being old doesn't make it legal to speed through school zones...
59007	0	a	Speeding in a school zone is bad business, no matter who is driving.  The officer did the right thing.
59008	0	a	I agree with your point that the rule is there for a reason and should be enforced.   I believe that’s why the ticket was given.   A judge’s job is to use discretion and that particular guy was obviously taking it very seriously.He couldn’t express himself well but I don’t believe there is any chance of him taking it lightly and continuing to speed In the future.  He’s at the end of his life trying to do his best for his family until his last day.   Personally I couldn’t given him a fine either
59009	0	a	Do 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 squats and 10km running every day for 3 years, and then at least you'll have a good excuse for being bald.
59010	0	a	You know, I don't find it all that inspiring when a handicapped person with cancer is dependent on their 96 year old father to get his treatment.
59011	0	a	I love the consideration he takes for people's situations. A lot of judges just see the offence and send it through but he takes the time to see what's going on.
59012	0	a	He's the ultimate bro and an excellent example of how judges should behave.
59013	0	a	I've delivered mail to this man at christmas time and he leaves out a full gift basket of full bottles of soda and snacks for not only mailmen but also ups and fedex aswell. Truly a great man
59014	0	a	I thought that at first as well, but he is in his 90’s. I think he just has tremors because of his age/fatigue. This was very touching. This man was in his 20’s during world war 2 and still drives his 60 year old son to cancer treatment.
59015	0	a	I think what makes him special, even over other judges with a kind heart, is that he seems to really care about the people he's talking to. He could have easily dismissed that case, and we'd still think he's a badass for doing it. But he wanted to get to know this man. He wanted to know about the man's son. He wanted the man to know about his son.      He's not just trying to be a good judge up there. He's also trying to be a good person. That combo is rare when judges have to get through so many cases in a day and still have loads of paperwork to sort out.
59016	0	a	He definitely looks familiar. I think he handled the one where a woman had to bring her kid to court because she had no childcare and he asked the kid some questions and told him to tell his mom the charges were dropped
59017	0	a	there should be some system in place for cases like this. Lots of places issue taxi vouchers to seniors to keep them from driving.  r/latestagecapitalism
59018	0	a	It makes me feel for his son, too. In addition to chemo, it must be so difficult to watch his 96 year old dad struggle to take care of him, when he, like most children with a good relationship with their parents, probably thought he'd be the one to be there for his elderly dad. I hope they get the assistance they need!
59019	0	a	I'm going to out on a limb and say the guy was probably doing slightly less than what the speed limit is adjacent to the school zone, but who knows. I don't think he'd be let off the hook if it was egregious.
59020	0	a	Does he at least drink beer?
59021	0	a	Especially being that old. Some people are too old to be on the road and speeding isn’t the only dangerous things
59022	0	a	That's why I really struggle to see how this is allowed. Like yeah, the judge is being nice, and that's cool, but if the dude was speeding in a school zone, he was speeding in a school zone. Just because he's old and he has a sad story to tell doesn't make him above the law.
59023	0	a	Yeah, I feel like if I was ever given a sentence by him, I wouldn't even be mad, since he took the time to understand what went on.
59024	0	a	Maybe ten years ago I was given a ticket I didn’t earn driving through a tiny town near where I live, so I decided to argue it. It meant missing a couple of hours of work. My colleagues thought I should just pay the ticket and move on. I’ll pay I ticket I earn, but not one I haven’t. So I sat in on a couple of hours of community court. I don’t know if this judge was unusual or if small community courts are all like this, but the judge was awesome. People had some of the most incredible hardships - he listened to every one and made decisions tailored to their problems. The experience gave me a new respect and understanding of what local judges do, and I’m glad I got to witness it.
59025	0	a	The judge is where the American system is supposed to benefit from the benevolent philosopher. The laws are the laws, but judges have incredible discretion. Like most of American democracy this has advantages and disadvantages. (See, e.g., convicted rapist Brock Turner; mass incarceration of black males for nonviolent drug charges).  Edit: forgot to use convicted rapist Brock Turner’s full name

59030	0	a	Oh man it’s the same in my area, public transport isn’t very good or cheap so people keep driving even when they’re not really up to it any more, because giving up their car means giving up everything outside of the house. Really needs to be more in place to make sure old people can get out and about without being a danger to anyone.
59031	0	a	Probably.  Some of the school zone speed limits are super low.  You can be going 20 in a 15 mph school zone and technically speeding.  You barely touch the pedal to go 20 mph.  I find it hard *not* to speed.  My wife works at the airport, and the speed limit approaching the departures area is 15 mph...it's painfully slow, but I have to do it because I've seen airport cops pulling people over before.
59032	0	a	I’m pretty sure many officers do use that discretion. Maybe this particular officer didn’t want the responsibility of deciding whether a man in this old age should be driving around. Sometimes recognizing our own limitation to make a judgement call is the best judgement call.
59033	0	a	If he sentenced you you know you'd deserve it!
59034	0	a	And I think thats all most of us as citizens are asking for. A little understanding of the context and a fair judgement. Shame its so difficult to get for so many. Good on this man for listening and helping when he can in his position.
59035	0	a	When I was a college student, I got a moving violation for failing to come to a full and complete stop before making a right turn at a red light.   *On. My. Bicycle.* 🙄  I couldn't really fight it, because I technically did break the law - but as a broke college student, I couldn't afford to pay the $385 fine, either. (It was the exact same ticket that you'd get for running a red light in a car.)  On a friend's advice, I go to court to beg for leniency. I'm nervous as hell, because I've never been in a courtroom before. The judge was very kind - he heard my plea, and instead of bankrupting a kid for being late for a midterm, he gave me 30 hours of community service.   The best part is, the judge's decision ended up making my life better. I chose to volunteer at a local botanical garden for my service, and that got me interested in conservation, which has led to my lifelong love of volunteering to clean up and fix local hiking trails. All because a judge showed kindness.

59038	0	a	Story time for you since I doubt many people will see this. I’ll give you the short version.  My father is a retired NYPD cop. He pulls a guy over one night, license, registration...the whole bit. Notices the guy is acting nervous and decides to ask him a couple questions.  Gets to “what’s your birthday?” and the man says “October 34th.”  My father says “October 34th, are you sure about that?” The guy responds with “...it’s either the 34th or the 35th, but to be honest I just smoked a joint and I’m super nervous right now.” Definitely one of my fathers favorite stories to tell.

59050	0	a	I call it awesome :) But Idg why firefighters didn’t continue hosing? 
59051	0	a	From a professional standpoint I can’t agree with this.   This guy has now not only delayed fire services, but he’s also placed the safety of the firemen who would have an obligation to place themselves at risk  that didn’t initially exist in attempt to rescue him.   As a human being that also has a 4 legged companion, I can appreciate the love and loyalty he has for his dog.  
59052	0	a	Never leave your best friend to die <3
59053	0	a	I wouldn’t have been able to watch my dog burn, I have no kids and live alone. Would not want or expect anyone else to risk their lives though
59054	0	a	Honestly if you put your dog in a kennel you have an obligation to your pet to do this. Dogs have a blind sense of loyalty for you to help them as they would for you as well. 
59055	0	a	why did they stop with the water?
59056	0	a	Yep, I have four animals. I would be going in. 
59057	0	a	Sucks because my brothers close friend died recently running back into her trailer home trying to save her dogs from a fire. I can't imagine the hell her husband is going through.  Edit: basically the man, woman, and dogs were sleeping in the trailer and woke up to part of it being up in flames. They instictly jumped up, and darted outside but the wife noticed she was missing her 3 dogs. She ran in trying to save them, and the husband ran in to try and get her back outside. One dog escaped, and about that time a wall collapsed and fell on the wife. Husband pulled her out from under the wall but she ended up passing away in ICU. The other two dogs died in the fire as well.

59087	0	a	So, when my mom was battling cancer, it was just ber, and my siblings and I, me and my brother still in high school. A local landscaping company came to the door to talk to my mom about signing up for their service that season. When she explained she had terminal cancer, and was on a fixed income, she couldn't afford to hire landscapers. I watched the guys arms drop to his sides and he says that he will have a crew out once a week to handle the landscaping, no charge. His mother in law is fighting the same fight and he understands what she was going through. It meant the world to us.

The septic guy didn't charge a mom who had breast cancer to dig her septic and replace a broken pipe.  The local mechanic/tow guy towed my 76 year old neighbor's car for free when it broke down.  Please, please, please support these small business people!! They often times take care of those who need it the most and many of them just make enough to get by."

59091	0	a	My neighbor used to fix boilers and told me this story about the time he got a call on Christmas day. From an old lady who had family in from out of town offer him any amount of money to come and fix her boiler heater which had stopped working suddenly.  He went to her house and she was a tiny 80 year old lady she thanked him for coming. It took him almost an hour to fix it then when he cam back up she was shuffling with her check book he just grabbed her hand and said you have a great Christmas with your family. Then left without accepting a dime
59092	0	a	When my elderly father, living in Wales, was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, the local hospital provided a device to help his breathing at home. They asked my mum for the power bill. Huh? Turns out they wanted to coordinate with them to *ensure that no power used by my father with this device would be charged to him*  So not only did they provide the device free of charge, they made sure its usage would also not result in higher bills.  That’s what you get with a national health service that is focused on care, not costs. For the record, they gave him excellent care to the very end. So that he was comfortable to the end. I will **always** be grateful to the NHS for the compassionate and timely care they gave my dad when he needed it. And mum was not stuck with a bill later.
59093	0	a	Well the boiler is fixed, so hers is warmed too.
59094	0	a	My friend works at a large vehicle mechanic shop (tractor trailers, farm equipment,  etc...) . An older woman came in and asked how much it would be to repair her RV and if she can pay in cash and coins. Someone put a hole in it backing up a hick mobile boat sized lifted truck with a 2ft long hitch. The guy ran and his plate cover obscured him from cameras.  It left a loaf of bread sized hole in it and broke her sinks plumbing. After finding out not only does she live in it she can't drive it her husband does but he was in the hospital recovering from having a 3ft section of intestine removed due to cancer they went and got it for her on their lunch break. They patched the hole, fixed the sink, and even filled it with dehumidifiers to fight of mold from the sink all for $1 for the appointment and $25 for the work (lowest they can charge) they drove her back to the Costco's parking lot she was parked at. Every year she sends them cookies and fruitcake from wherever they are.

59114	0	a	I’m the same with my team members, 100% flexible about their needs so long as they do the work. In return I’ve found that whenever some extra hours are required they’ll happily stay back or come in early.  If someone said I couldn’t work from home or come in late/leave early when needed I’d be petty as hell about doing the slightest bit of work outside my normal hours.
59115	0	a	The work at home should be increasingly promoted, as it both often offers better living conditions and working conditions but also because the fact that many people do not have to drive to their work could significantly reduce the CO2 emission.
59116	0	a	I'm fortunate enough to work somewhere with this approach. You're allocated work and (sometimes) a deadline - after that it's up to you how you go about it, so long as the work gets done. There's no micro-managing: you're trusted to be able to prioritise your workload and know the best way of undertaking it. If you have a particularly challenging or complex piece of work to do and need to avoid distractions, you work from home. Because of my employer's flexibility, when they require flexibility from me, I'm happy to oblige.  If it was otherwise I know that, personally, my productivity (and job satisfaction) would only be a fraction of what it is.
59117	0	a	Not quite agreed. If you are working as part of a team it *is* polite to say if you are going to be late for a doctor's appointment etc. Show consideration for the rest of your team, have the courtesy to keep your boss in the loop, so when *his/her* boss asks where you are, it looks like they know what their team are doing.
59118	0	a	As nice as this is, businesses rarely work like this
59119	0	a	The workplace has been infantized because of how many people do take the piss, though. It’s tragic but when you do stumble upon a boss or workplace that develops trust and good work rather than the opposite there is usually a number of people ready to take advantage of that.

59123	0	a	Same though. Apparently the ten hours I work a day isn't good enough. I took a vacation day today. Boss demanded I keep my phone on me to help the new guys. Maybe I don't know, actually trust them to do their jobs? They've been here several months they can handle it at this point.  6 days a week at 10 hours a day and he's constantly telling me I need to do more hours that I'm not catching up with my work. I told him I refuse to work more hours because I need some kind of personal time. He can just push it up the line and either they fire me or, they hire more people. I don't really care at this point.   There's zero support from him what so ever. He's refusing to believe that the project I'm starting Monday will take 8 hours a day of dedicated work from me. He won't give me help. I told him I won't be able to even touch the other 4 smaller projects I have let alone my usual day to day work and he's basically telling me to figure it out. Well, I will. I'll go with the client that pays the most and coincidentally the one I'm trying to get a job with. He can figure the rest out on his own.

59126	0	a	The idea of spending the overhead electricity, HVAC, and plumbing of an entire office building when people have those facilities at home is absurdly wasteful and counterproductive.  If someone isn’t doing their job, fire them.  If they are, reward them.  If you can’t tell the difference from a distance, you’re a bad boss.
59127	0	a	My SO had a boss like that too. One night my SO confessed to me that practically every workday for the past month she had cried on the way home from work. It was heartbreaking. Combined we were making good money. I told her to quit. She did. Our income dropped over $25k. She now has a job she enjoys, for less than half the money, but just seeing the change in her happiness day after day has been well worth the loss in income.  Conversely I have a boss like OP's image describes. I work in a law firm wearing shorts and t-shirt 5 days a week. I'm 20% more efficient as a result, and twice as dedicated because my boss gives me the freedom and comfort to be my best.  I could earn more elsewhere easily, but it would be almost impossible to be as comfortable doing so.  If bosses realized how much better production would be, and how much staff retention would improve if they just treated staff like OP's image, every boss would do the same.   Good luck to your SO. Maybe time for her to see what else is out there for her.

59129	0	a	"When I started as a lead, I made it clear upfront that as long as the customers are happy then I'm happy. I started ""flex time"" at the job and naturally, people loved it. I wasn't able to allow them to work from home just because of the job but if we could have, you better believe that that would have been a thing too. I sure as shit don't want to be at work at 0700 every single day for an eternity so I'm not going to make my employees be.  It worked out really well for us because we had a few early birds who wanted to be there at 0700 so they'd leave a little earlier each day. And then we had a few people like me that like rolling into work at some point between 0700-0800 and will stay until 1600-1700. Quite a few of them had an insane amount of medical appointments but what am I really going to do? Tell them that they can't go? Lol! Ok... So if they took two hours for an appointment, they just worked an extra two hours at some point in the pay period and our pay periods were by the month so working 15-30 minutes extra each day to catch up is super easy to do. And yes, sometimes we needed to work late but typically, everyone was fine with that because then it just meant that they were leaving earlier on a Friday or coming in later on a Monday."

I have individuals who work from home, on a regular bases, and some who even went as far as making them selves permanent teleworkers. As long as the shit gets done, and they are not on any written warnings, who cares.  But when there is clearly no reason for the policy change, or others are still able to telework, then it becomes a legal issue, then let them fire you and get the unemployment benefits.

59167	0	a	Well that driver may not get their driving privileges back for a LOOOOONG time.   If you’re asking why, if you have a seizure while NOT driving a doctor could be obligated to report you to the DMV. If it does get reported you need to be cleared by a neurologist. Now if you have a seizure while driving? A doctor would be held EXTREMELY liable if they didn’t report you to the DMV.   Edit: update - depends on state. Some states require the driver to report, some require doctor.
59168	0	a	A friend of the family has epilepsy and she was swimming in her pool with my daughter and her daughter, both 5 years old. Luckily I happened to be standing near the side of the pool as my friend floated by face down, convulsing. At first it didnt register what was happening, as I thought she was just playing a game with the girls. I pulled her out of the pool in the middle of her seizure and noticed her face and hands were blue. I had to perform CPR on her for a few minutes until she coughed up water. She is fine now but man epilepsy is scary. Glad to see this guy had the gumption to jump in and help. 
59169	0	a	This is awesome! These types of videos remind me of those shows on TV with the hidden camera where someone is being bullied or whatever and everyone else gets a chance to intervene.   I've intervened on occasions. Other times I haven't. When it's just me alone with no kids or family, I'm more apt to help because I wouldn't want to risk their safety and well being to act fast. But maybe that's an excuse...

59197	0	a	"> vibrate-through-a-wall levels of amped  Hell yeah he is.  I once stopped to help a woman who was running down a rural-ish highway waving at cars.  It was at like 3:30 AM on New Year's Day in dense fog.  Totally surreal.  She just opened my car door and got in, screaming her head off hysterically.  Then her boyfriend showed up and started yelling.  While I was on the cellphone with the cops.  Yada-yada-yada ... cops show up and arrest the guy and haul him off.  Turned out they had had an argument while driving,  and he had dragged her into the bushes and tried to choke her.  I was hella wired.  One of the cops just chilled with me on the side of the road shooting the shit for like 45 minutes until I felt ready to drive home.

Just calm stuff edging her on. Not to give up etc. No advise at all just encouragement.  Everytime she finally posts something and gets a response. She normally runs to me and shows me the comments in excitement, telling me she feels heard. And I live for that smile... and gladly nowadays, I don't even have to do much as other people have joined and they keep lifting her up.

59263	0	a	"Our dog does this because she was the runt of the litter.  Any time she gets food that's big enough to carry (bones/meat) she'll take it back to either her kennel or another area with corners (she loves those because of safety).  We got her from a closed down puppy farm that had just been busted and she still has issues at 6. Only ever barks when someone that's not family walks over the threshold of our house.  Never any time else. She communicates with other kinda funny noises between high pitched ""arroooo's"" in the morning and other non-normal noises.  Point is, this dog is definitely protecting its food. But it doesn't have to be a stray to develop that mentality, siblings can do the same thing."
59264	0	a	I “saved” my cat (found him outside and thought he was cute) from the streets and he does the exact same thing! If I give him a little bit of food he runs away with it before eating like I’m gonna take it back. I’ve had him now longer than he was ever a stray but that instinct is engrained.
59265	0	a	Maybe that’s what he needs more atm.
59266	0	a	She doesn't want cuddles, she's being submissive. It's very likely this dog suffered abuse and acts like this to avoid it happening again.
59267	0	a	I once found a cat in the parking lot of my old apartment complex.  Skin and bones.  She was three years old and weighed under 4.5 lbs (should be 9.5-10lb).  I brought some food out to her (my roommate had a cat) and she took a bite but then immediately started rubbing on my legs and purring.  Every few minutes she would go to take another bite and immediately come back for scratches and attention.  Anyway, that's the story of how I got my cat 8 years ago.

He **did not** like that, like at all, but eventually started listening to us. Another thing we did was making him sit and wait until all of us walked through any door before letting him go. In the beginning he would struggle his hardest to run through the door first but now he sits and waits to come in last.
59282	0	a	I saw it as being too scared to eat and thus being submissive to stay alive, rather than more happy to get affection than food

59287	0	a	Can i join the hug?
59288	0	a	It is sometimes. A lot of it is instinct, even for dogs that've never really had to competed for food (some do it, some don't). But it's extra common among strays and shelter dogs that get adopted, because of _why_ it's an instinct (food competition) that they've had experience with. Like a lot of things it can be ingrained from nature, nurture, or both.

One time I returned to work a couple hours after my shift because I had forgotten something. As I pull into the parking spot right in front of the store, someone walked right by the front of my car and into the store, jumped the counter, and threatened the only person there at the time with a knife. I froze up for what felt like forever, then I started my car, drove a block away, and called 911.   I can’t tell you how many times I relived that situation in my head. What I could have done differently. I could have driven my car up against the front door so the guy couldn’t escape. I could have went in behind him and at least then it would be 2v1 and the cook who was there alone had a broom in his hand at the time. But nope. I just froze up and then drove away to call the police.

59323	0	a	I mean I think that would almost encourage risking your life like a vigilante. This guy is hero no doubt, but it shouldn’t be encouraged to seek things out like that.

I don’t want to; I don’t feel safe. I don’t talk about it with anybody — I get really upset. I can’t talk about it with my friends. I did what I had to do — that’s why I don’t like being called a hero.
59327	0	a	Exactly.  If someone shoots up a school that person should get absolutely zero coverage.  No Bullshit fame for someone that kills
59328	0	a	This should be for every shooting or tragedy. I don't know if it's improving recently, maybe I'm optimistic, but I can't honestly tell you the names of either the MAGAbomber or the Synagogue shooter.   Keep it that way. This guy deserves his name in the papers, they do not. 
59329	0	a	Yeah but that’s just humility 
59330	0	a	I’ve tried to convince myself I did the best thing. The guy could have easily just grabbed a stool and broke the glass. He could have taken the lone employee hostage or just attacked him. 
59331	0	a	We're the only one. The world looks at us in horror. 
59332	0	a	Absolutely. But rather hear about a hero like this than the entire background information of the shooter. Perhaps if we focused on good deeds, we’d have happier people!
59333	0	a	If it makes your feel any better although we hear about every shooting on the news and it's tragic, overall violent crime is the lowest it's ever been. 
59334	0	a	Why shouldn’t he get some sort of government hero’s award. He is no vigilante he was not the instigator here. He saw a chance to save his friends lives at the likely expense of his.  This guy should get a parade and a scholarship. His selfless act of sacrifice should be  rewarded and recognized at the highest levels of honor society can provide as an example of what is best in human nature.   What would you have done? Saw a chance and yielded to cowardice? Let all your friends die and you likely got shot anyway. 
59335	0	a	The State Department has reward programs for helping take down terrorists, drug lords, animal traffickers, murderers, fraudsters, and more... so that's not really a valid excuse if the US government encourages similar stuff already. See the [Rewards for Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewards_for_Justice_Program) program, and also the [Narcotics Rewards Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotics_Rewards_Program). If we're paying out millions to people who often have to go into hiding for the rest of their lives, this isn't that much of a stretch by comparison.

59340	0	a	Or survivor's guilt.
59341	0	a	No it's not just humility. People who act heroically don't always make that choice. They just act. They don't specifically decide to do whatever it is they did. Like Anthony said, he did what he *had* to do, not what he thought was best.   I'm not an expert on this at all, but there's a pretty good radiolab episode you might want to give a listen to. How To Be A Hero.  I'm not saying that Anthony isn't a hero. Objectively, he absolutely is. Even if people who act heroically don't necessarily make the choice to act heroically, doesn't down play what they did. For some bizarre reason, I feel like because there wasn't even a choice to be made, it was just the only option for them, it makes them better? Some next level human shit. Who knows, maybe Anthony did make a choice.  Ultimately, what I'm getting at is respect what Anthony was saying. If he doesn't want to be called a hero, don't just brush that off. It could be (and probably is) coming from a deeply complicated and emotional place. Like another commenter said, possibly survivors guilt.  I don't know why your comment struck such a nerve with me, but it did. And I'll be honest, I didn't put a ton of thought into my reply. I just wrote what I was feeling.
59342	0	a	Man, you are so right. We immortalize the monster rather than the hero, likely inspiring other monsters
59343	0	a	That’s nice but kids should never get shot at school period, and I don’t think that’s something we should ever accept happening regardless of crime statistics.
59344	0	a	Is it exposed organs/flesh under there? Is it super fragile? Like if you were to catch a fight would a gutter do you in? Thats a wierd question ik. But i recently moved and a guy was wearing a bag and i was really suprised how much weight he pulled.

59347	0	a	So I had a bag for a while and you have a piece of intestine (called a stoma) sticking out about an inch. It moves around on its own sometimes and poops/farts into the bag (made dinner very fun because you can’t control it). It’s really not that fragile, no pain nerves or anything so you can touch it and you won’t feel it.   You change the bag every couple of days to clean the stoma and the skin. It’s mentally taxing but for me, my colon was so fucked so I felt 1000000x better afterwards. 
59348	0	a	It's called a stoma. You can Google it... It's a bit unsettling to see at first but you get used to it. Basically some of your interesting comes out of your stomach.   If someone punched you in that spot it wouldn't kill you but it would push it in to you and hurt so fucking bad. Also if got pushed in to far it would leak poop inside of you which could kill you slowly and painfully. Overall you can live a pretty normal life just gotta check for leaks and if your bag is filled with too much gas. 
59349	0	a	An old lady named Doreen worked herself into a frenzy over gun control yesterday.  Just because I raised my eyebrows at her unsolicited, pro-gun statements while we both happened to be taking a smoke break.  There were other people there too, who agreed with *her*, but she still got really upset at me.  I literally did not say a word to her.  These are not reasonable people.  Frankly it's more than a little disturbing that they are the most likely to have guns.
59350	0	a	Or taking guns away completely.   Republicans: 'Them libs taking our guns away!!' Common sense person: 'No we just want better control so school shootings aren't happening every week.'
59351	0	a	Wow. Upkeep sounds aggravating. Does it attatch/detatch easily?  Im suprised you cant feel the intestine seeing how brutal food poisoning feels on the whole digestive system.
59352	0	a	I don't know what I'd do if some of my interesting came out of my stomach.
59353	0	a	I called my first one Stoma Steve. Now I have an ileostomy, his name is Billy Ostomy.
59354	0	a	Republicans: The government has no power to tell us how to live our lives and dictate what we do!    Also republicans: We support the government in making abortions illegal and making it harder to access birth control.
59355	0	a	Your body has different types of sensory nerves -- you just don't notice because the parts you're aware of have all of them.  Your intestines can feel pain from being stretched too much (like from being too full with gas), and from muscle cramps (same as your skeletal muscles when you work out too hard). They don't have any nerves that can sense touch, firm pressure, or warmth.
59356	0	a	That is pretty weird to think about, maybe there are pain receptors on the inside and that’s why we feel pain with food poisoning? I have no clue honestly  The bag is specialized for this type of thing so they shouldn’t come off easily (you need certain wipes to remove the adhesive). People play sports in them and go swimming. They may leak if it’s put on poorly or you have really really liquidy poops, so people will eat certain foods to thicken it up. Helps with emptying too which is done through the bottom of the bag into a toilet (kinda like a heavy duty ziploc bag).   Edit: for irony by the way, I went to MSD and graduated in 2010 lol 
59357	0	a	Don’t worry about being personal! I actually did an AMA a few years ago about it, I think it’s important for people to ask questions and to learn more!  The answer depends on what is happening inside at that moment. For example, my first surgery removed my colon and my small intestine was stuck out of my body, meaning that it didn’t connect to anything internally. Therefore, my rectum is just hanging out and getting a break from it’s job of storing waste. However, it still produces some mucus that you might need to let out in the toilet. So no poop/gas because nothing is connected to it at that time, just mucus.  After my second surgery, my rectum was removed and my small intestine was brought back into my body and made into a J-shape which ultimately replaced my rectum. While that healed up, my small intestine formed a loop on the outside of my body where the initial stoma was, kind of like a kink in a hose, and that went into a bag. Sometimes though, because it’s a loop, some poop may continue traveling and than you let that out the normal way. It’s really fascinating how our body handle this stuff.  Now, after that ”J-pouch” healed, they close the loop and stick the small intestine back inside...then normal bathroom habits again! Wooooo 
59358	0	a	This stuff is so damn weird. Like, a reminder that we’re all just organic robots with literal plumbing inside us to get things that our body needs for whatever reason.

59385	0	a	"My Ex and I took in one of our friends who had broken up with her SO, and had no place to go. She decided to try 'dancing' and we took her to her audition.   I was going to wait in the car, but my Ex told me not to be silly and come inside to wait. I had a paperback novel with me, so I sat there and read it at the bar, thinking I would be left alone.  That's when about 6 half dressed ladies came up to me and started ripping on me, in a good-natured, pleasant way. ""I don't think I've ever seen anyone read a book in here before!"" etc.  They nicknamed me ""Book"" and whenever I'd come to pick the roommate up from work, they'd be like ""Hi Book!""  I ended up being pretty comfortable around them and it pretty much changed my mind about strip clubs. I still think it's weird, but I am glad the women have a safe(er) alternative to prostitution and more power to them if they can earn a decent living flashing some skin.  I also didn't realize how much athleticism and skill some of them have while dancing (this was a while ago before the pole dancing workouts and when people still read physical books). "
59386	0	a	I wish people would stop trying to catch eachother out
59387	0	a	As someone like your cousin how did this end for him?
59388	0	a	The initial awkwardness aside, strippers make for great conversations with socially awkward dudes because they don’t judge. Ever. They can’t, and not in a turn your nose up, “You take off your clothes and grind on people for money, you can’t judge me” way, it’s basically their job to not judge you.    From a business perspective, they get the best returns not by coming up to 10 different guys for 10 different private dances/whatever that’s a lot of work for maybe 10 different reasons they can’t/won’t buy a dance or buy them a drink. Its best to keep one guy hooked for the long haul, so it’s in their vested interest to stick with one person and be interested in you (or feign interest in you). They will find something, anything to find common ground between dances or sitting with your friends to keep you engaged.    You hold the money, you have the keys to the kingdom. Remember that at the end if the day, that $20-40 bumpy grindy dry hump set to ZZ Top’s “Lagrange” is a business transaction she has to sell you on, it she goes about her business to someone else. Want to talk about the last episode of Game of Thrones? Sure. Your fantasy football team? Hey, she also drafted that dude in her team, he sucked last week! Your anime fan-faction? No... no probably not. I mean... maybe...? Naw. But most everything else is fair game if you have the money and you follow the rules.   Is your life boring? Make something up! What’s she gonna do, call you out on it? I have friends who used to go to on a regular basis to a strip Club and would take me with them maybe one a month and I made it a point to really sell one lie each night to make things interesting. Fake job, just came back from a fake vacation, fake interesting celebrity I kinda sorta know because my college roommate works for their publicist and I’ve met them 3 times. Get crazy, she’ll dump you out if her mind at the end of the night and at worst you look stupid in front of someone you’ll probably never see again. At least not without a black light on and Motely Crue blaring out of the speakers.

59399	0	a	My sister has epilepsy, so does her husband. Once I was visiting and she had a seizure while holding her baby. I grabbed my niece similar to the video, but thankfully my sister was sitting when it happened so she just slid down onto the floor. It’s weird. I’ve seen her and her husband have a handful of episodes, and I used to worry for my niece when she was little, but she survived. She’s 9 now.  You may not realize how common of a disorder it is.
59400	0	a	This is very out of place, but I have to laugh at how the baby just accepts being taken by another person.   „I guess ur my new momma now“

59405	0	a	It's really hard to say as it varies but if you notice someone just sort of start going fuzzy in terms of cognition, they start getting confused when moments ago they weren't, muscle rigidity or severe muscle relaxation, blank stare. It's hard to determine exactly whether what you're witnessing is a seizure or some other neurological condition but it's a good idea to general check in on someone that starts exhibiting these behaviors. Some people with seizure disorders have visual cues such as necklaces or bracelets that they experience a condition which can help narrow down what's going on. My cousin used to have a pretty good ability of alerting people before she went down so it can sometimes be expressed by the individual prior to an episode. If people exhibit these behaviors just take it as seriously as you can and if you're unsure of why someone just blacked the fuck out in front of you- recovery position for the victim and either yourself or SPECIFICALLY designate and individual (hey, YOU, call the police now) to get emergency services headed in your direction.
59406	0	a	Most people just sort of go blank. Eyes stare off into the distance, lips smack slowly, drool a bit. Looks a lot like someone who just had dental work and they're kind of out of it.  That's what happens with me. I get an aura before (just a weird sensation that I can't explain) so I usually go somewhere private. I don't have grand mals though. People with those you need to get them on the ground away from anything they can hit if possible. They'll just flail around some, not much you can do during.

59414	0	a	My mother has very easy to tell seizures.  She has memory issues. When the seizure comes then all you’ve got to do is ask “when’s your birthday” and you’ll quickly find they get frustrated/confused.   For her, memory had always been a big tell.  Her first seizure came a day after she had obvious memory issues. If you are around friend or family that can’t remember the simplest thing for no reason whatsoever, keep a close eye on them for a day or two.   But really, we’re talking memory loss to seizure in anywhere between 2-60 minutes, let alone a full day like her first.   Just ask questions with simple answers if you ever suspect someone to be exhibiting signs of a potential seizure. The blank stare is fucking terrifying but nothing’s more scary than someone who can’t remember English, let alone the fact it’s called a “cup” or a “remote” or “cat”/“dog”

But basically it was like a time jump. Last thing I remember is talking to my coworker joking around as I climbed into my truck and then the next thing I knew I was in an emergency van waking up at hospital but I wasnt fully aware of what happened or fully conscious for like another half hour, just sort of going through motions. I remember my body sort of having that dough feeling too but it's hard to describe what it actually feels like, but that's an accurate odd description lol. From the time it happened to when I was actually aware of what happened was like an hour and a half.

59422	0	a	Its more primal with babies. Mammels are so protective of young it throws us off when a mother lets her guard down. The baby in the video was was offered in a maternal way. Relaxed grip near another human was a desperate gesture for the mom realizing the worst is happening. You'd be surprised how instinctual taking that baby would be. Like yawning when someone else yawns. 
59423	0	a	I had a classmate in jr high with epilepsy or something, she was new and had the teacher put her next to someone she trusted(me in this class).

59430	0	a	I had a similar thing happen in 2015 in that I had a random seizure in my sleep and have not had another one since then. I had to have a whole lot of tests and my neurologist ultimately said that I didn’t have epilepsy and that the seizure had been triggered from a lack of sleep and dehydration. I had flown 16 hours from Sydney to LA, arrived at about 6:30am, went to Disneyland for the day and got back to the hotel around 11pm where I went straight to sleep. My seizure happened while I was asleep and it woke my sister in law who called 911. I don’t remember a single thing about the seizure and I only remember waking up in a hospital bed being rushed into the ER. I remember waking up with a terrifying feeling of not knowing where I was and what was happening. I’m now very careful about sleeping regularly when I’m travelling!

59473	0	a	They somehow seem to notice other sharks 'feeling better' after they where close to that specific (human, but they don't know that) being in the water... so they seek out help too. More animals show that kind of behaviour.      The remarkable thing is the docility the sharks show. Really unexpected for me.

59475	0	a	Grew up on a few ranches, yes animals do know. Not all of them but some do know. Wild birds of prey and predators are particularly aware of your intentions and capabilities and will seek out a human for help at times. Meanwhile my cat still tries to slice my hand off when I brush him.

59492	0	a	I saw an episode of Nova Science Now that showed proof that dolphins communicate.  As briefly as I can summarize it, they taught dolphins the command to do tricks together.  Then they taught them a command to do a new, never-before-seen trick.  Then they did both commands together.  Both dolphins dived underwater, clicked back and forth, then returned to the surface and simultaneously did a new trick.  It was awesome to see the dolphins talking to each other.

59494	0	a	"If you watch the new Planet Earth, they do a bit on reef ""cleaning stations"". Both predator and prey fish, including sharks, all know to show up to the same spot on the reef where special fish & shrimps live that help clean all the parasites and dead skin off them.  In exchange, the predators stay pretty chill, and cleaner fish/animals don't get eaten.  This isn't too far off from that concept...they obviously have some ability to recognize another animal that will help keep them healthy, and also some way to communicate that animal's presence to other sharks.  This lady is basically a giant cleaner shrimp in their eyes."

59498	0	a	Also, being predators, it's not unreasonable to think they're intelligent enough to make that association especially since they don't really (at least not usually) consider humans to be food.

I was coming home from work one day and I see one drop in and try to drop a walnut under my tire but it missed, so I pulled over and grabbed the walnut, put it on the sidewalk, and stamped on it with my foot, cracking it open. The crow landed on the sidewalk and I backed up. It looked at me and then at the walnut and it was like you could hear the gears turning in its head.  After a bit, it picked up part of the walnut, hopped over to me, and set it in front of me while looking at me, then hopped back and started eating the rest of the walnut. Corvids have been my favorite birds ever since.

59519	0	a	Rocks are around even longer. They don’t communicate tho. 
59520	0	a	Not a shark expert by any stretch, but most animals have evolved communication of some kind, whether conscious or not - especially those who have communities, as sharks do. Dolphins chatter and have extensive body language; fish use body language and also colour and chemical signals. Sharks might be somewhere in that spectrum?  It's reasonable to assume that since they live in groups, and communication typically favours survival of both group and individual genes, they have likely evolved with some kind of communication.  Now I want to Google shark language 😄  Edit: basic Googling tells me that they don't have any throat organs that can produce sound - they are a perfectly silent hunter. Scientists have established that they use complex body language to send signals around mating and group hierarchy. They also use their strong sense of smell, which is on the level of chemical communication. Researchers who study specific schools report recognition on the part of those they are studying. TIL: sharks are neat!

59535	0	a	It's worth noting that Dolphins echolocate. Based on our analysis of their brains, they have better visual processing than us. It's likely that they don't exactly have words for things so much as they replicate the sound of the object. It's like imagine if you naturally had a projector and could flash images on a wall. Telling someone else how to do a trick would be as easy as using youtube. It took us hundreds of thousands of years to invent video but dolphins never needed it.
59536	0	a	"No, you shouldn't assume anything about their language at this point. They're clearly capable of communicating very precise ideas but whether or or not there is specific grammar or sentence structure, or even what might constitute a ""word"" is still unclear. "

59565	0	a	Yes; it’s a hard thing to watch.  For those that didn’t see it: Steve-O recorded a lot of his time getting extremely high by himself and talking to the camera.

59576	0	a	The thing in his hand is a whipped cream canister, that in this case is lacking in cream as he is using it to take whipits. Those blue cartridges contain nitrous oxide and go in the whipped cream canister, when inhaled the user gets a brief but intense and euphoric high.

The high is very short like 30 seconds to a minute but when you start chaining them together it can get pretty intense.   You have little epiphany’s about whatever you’re thinking about or whatever people around you are talking about, but you can never verbalize your amazing thought which fades a few seconds later.  The only way to get it back is by doing more whip it’s which is how these things can get so addictive.  Doing whip it’s will tripping is fucking insane.  It’s by far the most intense drug experience I’ve ever had.  You can loose yourself in weird space time loop crazy shit.

I've had a blast on nitrous but it's essentially just glorified huffing, for some reason people don't judge as much when you're doing it from a cracker/balloon instead of a can/bottle  Edit: sooo I'm gonna go ahead and post this link here that is a very good article on nitrous, which is an incredibly interesting substance. It details its uses, why exactly it's so safe especially relative to other drugs, some interesting stuff about how it affects brain waves... but most importantly which also breaks down some of the dangers with both short-term-high-quantity usage as well as chronic exposure to even minute quantities. I use drugs regularly but I'm a very firm believer in harm reduction and being as informed as possible about what's going into your body and how important it is to know the possible side effects of abuse. I'm especially worried about some of the responses below that say you can do it every day as long as you take a B12 vitamin.... definitely NOT recommended haha  http://www.medicaldaily.com/nitrous-oxide-side-effects-eeg-test-shows-laughing-gas-alters-brainwaves-3-minutes-341632  This article from Anaesthesia Progress: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2614651/  is the one they get the information about negative side effects of abuse and chronic exposure from

IIRC it was her dad at first, and then once she was in a more mentally stable and healthy place, they revoked it guardianship with the condition that it would come back if she fucked around again. So far, so good.

When I came to I actually had to stop and say out loud ""My name is JLD2k6 and I'm a person"" because I was shocked to find out that I was a human being this whole time. I am not sure but I imagine that is what they call ego loss. It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.   "

59608	0	a	I agree that he's a huge inspiration, and I'm not trying to be nitpicky here, but I think it's important to mention. The idea that X person was able to get sober and that means that anyone can is really reductive and unhelpful, particularly for people who are new in sobriety. Just wanted to get that perspective out there because I hear it a lot and see it a lot on Reddit, not at all out of malice, but just a lack of understanding I think. Again, not trying to be rude, just wanted to mention that, and I agree with your comment otherwise.  
59609	0	a	Yeah. I feel for that; but people lose others all the time. At some point you have to call it what it is: addiction.

59620	0	a	Such a good point. Will-power/motivation/etc. of course are needed, but in many many situations you also need plenty of support from your environment and the people in your life. Being rich (or having rich friends/family) really helps too.  I don't think it minimizes Steve-O's growth to acknowledge all the factors that helped him get to where he is now. He comes off as a pretty humble dude so I wouldn't be surprised if he would be the first to point out the positive factors in his life that pushed him towards sobriety.  Everyone's situation is different and I don't think it's useful to compare scenarios without considering the wider context.
59621	0	a	The drug abuse and addiction probably arose / were exacerbated by the loss. Many people lose others but those many people don't have millions of dollars, few responsibilities and access to as many drugs as they can consume.
59622	0	a	I think he feels responsible for his death.   If I recall correctly they were in a tough car accident when they were young, Ryan Dunn was driving and he crashed the car and almost killed everyone.   He kinda failed to get him to get his shit together and maybe their stupidity / recklessness made things worse for Ryan's behaviour.   The feeling of guilt is devastating.

59640	0	a	A couple years before I got sober a few friends and I were on MDMA and decided to take some whippets straight out of the canister. I remember feeling really weird about it and as we were going around the circle two of my friends started seizing when they did it. The guy I was dating at the time said it felt like when he was brought back to life by paddles when he tried to kill himself. It was the first time I realized I might have a drug problem and never touched whippets again.. it took me a couple more years to hit bottom but man.. drugs are scary stuff. Especially when you're uneducated about them, as I was.   Addiction is no joke. But there is a solution. It's just a matter of seeking it out and putting in the work. Whoever might read this, you're worth it. Whether you believe it or not.   You. Are. Worth it.

59643	0	a	"Believe it or not, my father in law gets this all the time.  Every time I'm over there in the summer, at some point the neighbor kids start to congregate on the front lawn and eventually one will come knock on the door and say, ""Can Pawpaw come out?"" His big thing is to play a very loud, heavily modified version of baseball in the yard, with him as pitcher.  Everybody ends up participating, even grownups."
59644	0	a	When I was a kid there was this old lady next door. Not gonna lie, she was my best friend for a couple of years. This is when my parents and I moved to a different country and I didn't know anybody. I'm extremely allergic to cats and she had 4 of them, so whenever I used to go to her house my face would puff up and I couldn't breathe properly but despite that, I would continue to go until we finally moved. Damn, thinking about this now brings a tear to my eye especially since I know she has passed away by now because she was like 90 back then. Wherever you are now Anne, I hope you know that you made some of the hardest years of my life bearable and that you will always hold a special place in my heart.
59645	0	a	This is so wholesome  Reminds me of the story my parents' Dalmatian they got when they moved into their first house. She loved kids and was trained to stay on the property so when she saw any kids around the neighborhood she'd run full tilt to the edge of the yard to see them, tail wagging furiously. But it scared them away so the next time she crawled along on her belly as close as she could until they came over to pet her. After that the kids would regularly come knock on the door to see if Abbie could come out to play <3

My mom and I shared one of our role models. A nun in our town.  When each of us were little she would let us garden with her, and if we cleaned the bird bath she would give us root beer barrels.
59649	0	a	Ok so this reminds me of me and the other kids back in the 80s.   We grew up playing street football. Loved that shit. Back in 3rd and 4th grade we could t throw the long bombs very well.   One day, this black dude moves in to the neighborhood. His name was Marvin and he was a postal worker. We were a neighborhood of white kids. One day he sees us playing and asks if we need a “permanent quarterback”. Yes! Omg.   So I guess he played I. High school and/or college. Dude was strong as shit and he had alllll these plays. He’d design plays with us by the curb. I’d be a bottle cap or a stick or whatever. He told us how to block and do juke moves. The stutter steps.   So we play with Marvin for the next few years. We’d go by and ask if he could play. He always did. He was a huge dolphins fan and he always called me “duper” because I think one of the Miami receivers was Duper.   Anyway, I’m 47 years old now and Marvin must be dead or in his eighties by now. Anyway, your husband is gonna be remember by those kids for decades. I’ll never forget Marvin.
59650	0	a	Growing up in my neighborhood we had a group of about 20 kids and 4 or 5 dads that would meet up outside almost every night to toss footballs around, play soccer, or play tag/wrestling.   I wonder if this type of thing still occurs. You learn a lot about socializing and making friends from close group activity.
59651	0	a	Happened to me many years back...  we had a neighborhood BBQ on a Sunday and it was a real hot day and water guns and hoses came out.  I may or may not have dumped a bucket of water from an upstairs bathroom out the window on two kids in the driveway (ok... I did) .  I won't lie... it was fun and the night ended with s'mores, ice pops, and sparklers.   Went to work the next day and my wife called me to say six kids came over around 10am to ask if I could come out to play.   The best part was they called her 'Mrs' and referred to me with my first name.

He also used my red nail polish on the dinosaurs mouths to make them look like they are fighting each other. The kids next door always knock on the door to get my dad to come out to play and show them the garden and teaches them about the animals! Also we have a African grey parrot, 2 rag doll cats and a tortoise which the kids love to look at and learn about. The happy look on my dads face when he’s with them is the cutest thing ever!

59660	0	a	"I had one of those! Her name was Dorothy. She lived across the street from my grandma and had a basement full of all of the toys her grandkids outgrew. There was a huge model train set, several dollhouses with homemade furniture, a giant tub full of dolls and another one filled with homemade clothes. Plus, she had cats and dogs and a really grumpy ferret.  I'd spend two to three nights a week at my grandma's house, and I'd always ask to go play at Dorothy's. My grandma, who'd known her for half of forever, always told me ""Yes, but don't make a nuisance of yourself, and you come straight back home when she tells you it's time to go.""   Dorothy NEVER told me it was time to go, and usually my grandma would come collect me after a couple hours. During that time, I'd entertain myself in the basement, eating the cookies Dorothy would bring down for me. Sometimes I'd go upstairs and sit in the ""parlor"" with her. (She called it the parlor. It looked like a regular ol' living room to young me.) She'd pull down these huge, dusty photo albums from the bookshelf and show me blurry black and white pictures of her family and tell me stories about them.  And then...my mother found out. She screamed at my grandma for hours for letting me go to ""some crazy old lady's house"" unsupervised. My grandma tried to tell her that she'd known Dorothy for 20 years or better but mom didn't care and I didn't get to go to my grandma's for quite a while.  By the time my mother got over herself and let me spend nights with my grandma again, Dorothy had passed away and a new family was living in that big white house across the street.  It's been 25 years or so now, and Gram is gone, too...but sometimes I still drive by and remember all the fun I had there."

59674	0	a	When my mom had my brother we were living in a very small town in Inyo country ca. She had just moved there as a single mother of two with one on the way based upon the name of the town.   I was 5 and my sister was 6.  We wanted to throw her a party when she returned from the hospital so we went to each of our neighbors and invited them. We also informed each neighbor what items to bring (cake, food etc), we sat and tore up newspapers for confetti with neighbor kids.   The party was a success.   That town was really supportive of my family for the years we were there. It a good place.  Edit:  Thank you for the silver! Edit 2: howdy stranger thanks for the gold!
59675	0	a	We have had a neighbor across the street when I was growing up who was retired. I use to love going over just to watch him work on his late 80s Jeep. He was rebuilding the engine, rewiring everything. I would constantly bug him with questions, he would answer every one of them and to the best of his ability try to get my 10 year old mind to understand it. I remember my mom told me to stop bothering me and told me I couldn’t go over anymore. After like a week he came by the house to check up on me to see if I was ok because he was worried. He spoke with my parents and assured them I was no trouble and finally I was allowed back over. That man set me on a path in life; I work on airplanes for a living now. I remember him and his wife becoming good friends with my parents and they even came to my oldest sisters wedding. Some neighbors are the best.  Edit: Thank you for silver kind stranger!

59678	0	a	When I was a kid (5ish years old) I would get my parents in trouble.  I’d grab a stick and walk up and down the brick fence that would divide our property with our neighbours.   “JAAACK!! JOOOAAAAN!!” I would call until they came out for a chat.  I usually didn’t have to wait long, often they would be out gardening and I would pepper them with questions.  I don’t remember what we spoke of, but my mum told me to stop bothering them and they told her off.  “He’s just a boy let him be curious” they’d say.  One story I remember Jack telling me that he was a world war vet (before I understood what this was) and he would use rubbish bin lids as bullet shields.  I thought he was the coolest and I just wanted to talk to them all the time.  They would have long passed, it’s been 30 years since this memory and they were already elderly, but I remember these two people so vividly.  I miss them a lot and I barely even knew them
59679	0	a	Good neighbor peeps
59680	0	a	Use to live across from people my family knew for like 40 years.  One day when family was out of town, they asked if they could get some water because something at their place was being repaired.  For two days they came and grabbed buckets and buckets of water.  On the third day, their grand kid came over and raised my fridge. An hour later they popped by and we were watching movies.  She was supposed to invite me to their sons birthday bbq.  So in exchange for water I got grilled foods and cake.
59681	0	a	"On my 11th birthday I had about 9 or 10 friends over, and we ran around the neighborhood playing ""Murder in the Dark"". Which is like an extreme hide and go seek game where the seeker ""kills"" the hider and the other hiders find them and start an investigation to try to catch the killer. All the while the killer trys to silently take down the other hiders without being caught. Well it was December in East Tennessee, so it was dark around 6:30 or so. So about 7-8 we're running through my neighborhood playing and having fun, as children do, and unbeknownst to us there was a van following us around. My neighbor who always sat in his yard drinking and working on Jeeps called the law on the van and the police nabbed him. He was arrested as a felon in possession of firearms. He had two guns in the van. My parents told me about this years later, but I'm glad that I had a neighbor watching out for us neighborhood kids."

59694	0	a	I really like this post but I always feel bad for the few who didn't get a job by the end of the week
59695	0	a	I think this is so important as a manager. I used to hire a lot of contract help. They knew the job was only for several months, but people were let go from the project one at a time. I always kept a list of other employers who were looking for talent in our field and did resume tune-ups.  I had people move on to dozens of different companies. It wasn't why I did it, but many of those people stay in touch with me, decades later. Something that takes very little time on the part of a manager can literally change the trajectory of a young person's career.
59696	0	a	OP here. Still at the next job I got making around a third more than I was. I work in government contracting and jobs come and go frequently in the business. Contracting companies are awarded contracts and lose contracts all the time often with little to no notice. It is a risky business. The only folks in my line of work that seem to have issues when this comes up are the older folks (sadly). Most of the folks had jobs by the end of the next week, but a few ended retiring early. Always have your resume up to date folks.

The rest is split between the local council executives office and the manufacturer of the popcorn.  If you legitimately want to help your coworker send their kid to summer camp, it is expensive, you are better off making a straight donation to the troop.  Unless you really like overpriced above average popcorn.  Grew up in boy scouts with my dad as our leader.  We didn't do the popcorn sale because there are a multitude of better ways to raise money for the troop.

59765	0	a	I'm honestly not trying to be an asshole but wouldn't there be a market for an athletic type of Hijab?    It sounds like an SNL skit but something that can cover her hair properly and cling tight but breathe isn't that too hard to come up with.
59766	0	a	Did play stop or did they do this with the ball still live?
59767	0	a	This is very touching. Women supporting women :)  Edit: with all due respect to the people commenting on how the hijab is a symbol of oppression for women (I understand  where you’re coming from), the reasoning behind people wearing it is very different for each person.   For example, my one friend who wears a hijab is the only girl in her family to wear it. Her mother and father have actually asked her to not wear it out of fear that someone may assault her for outwardly practicing her religion.   To assume all women who wear head coverings are being forced to, is discrediting their autonomy.   Not to say there aren’t people who are forced, but there are many who do choose to do this to honor their Allah.   If we want to support women and the their body their choice notion, we also have to support their religious freedom and how they exercise that. And for women who are forced to wear hijabs, they also deserve emotional support-instead or making them feel ashamed for their situation. :)

On the way home we had to stop and fill a prescription for antibiotics and we stop at Walmart.   She was still a little loopy from the sedation and she was walking very slowly and strangely. She refused to be carried. As we cross the crosswalk, slowly, somebody honked at us. Honked!   A man crossing the other direction literally yelled at the driver can’t you see she has a disabled child!   It made me so sad to think that somebody with a disabled child who was walking slow and maybe a little weird would be honked at by a stranger. On a crosswalk.

And then I set it between us like it was a thing decided. He started munching and told me how he hadn't had pizza in years and it was as good as he remembered it. Every day after that until he died I would go out and share whatever lunch I brought with him. Idk if I made a difference in his life or not but he accepted me and I think I made him feel human.

59891	0	a	Never a hint of threat? How can you assume that? If she’s been accosted by men before, for accepting “help” from them, the mere fact that this guy approached her at all was “threatening” in her eyes, or had the potential to be. You never know when that “kind man” could turn on you and say you owe him.   He didn’t do that, according to the story, but just because you’re in a public place doesn’t erase any and all danger wtf  Edit: should have said “could have been threatening in her eyes” and not “was threatening.”   There. Happy?   Point was, as per the comment I was replying to, the overall assumption that a homeless woman was somehow magically extra super safe and not AT ALL still at risk, merely because she was in a public place was kind of incredulous to me. That’s it. I didn’t say shit about *all men* anything, so calm down.   Everyone’s assuming a whole lot about a screen shot of a secondhand story, anyway lol
59892	0	a	"Hence me saying the ""possibility"". Homeless people get robbed, jumped, and harassed on the regular.

You’re trying to make the world a better place. It took 30 years for things to get as bad as they are right now. So, I want you to understand that it might take 30 years to get us to the place where everyone has a home, and what they need to live a fulfilling life.   If you want to make this world better, that means playing a long game.   I want you to do what it takes to care for yourself to fully show up, every day, for this game. That means that you eat, sleep, move, and declutter. Every week.  Every time we sit down together, I’m going to ask you what you are doing to take care of yourself. You get to say “Netflix and frozen pizza” for three weeks in a row. But if that’s still your answer on week four, we are going to have a serious conversation.  Keep showing up. The small ways that you make this problem better, every day, add up.

When my dad inquired what it would cost the attendant laughed and said follow me, this is just something Billy likes to do for his fans. Gave us VIP front row seats! One of my best memories with my dad.
59937	0	a	This has been the case for decades. My sisters were selected for the front row way back in the 90’s. Maybe during one of his dueling piano shows with Elton John.  Also, it isn’t just attractive women up there, as my sisters are both hideous individuals.

59940	0	a	At the Billy Joel/Elton John concert in Wichita, KS few years ago they both did this.  Except... Billy's side was full of young 20s women, and Eltons side was full of young 20s men. And Billy pointed it out during the show.  And it definitely wasn't based on where their original seat was located cause they were finding them in the hallways, not where they were sitting.  Edit: My crappy typing
59941	0	a	Coldplay does it too, for their biggest fans. I went with my dad to their concert and made pins that said “father daughter Coldplay concert” modeled after one of their album motifs and we got bumped up to front row from a roadie. The ticket scanning people weren’t even sure what to make of it, and thought we had been tricked until they worked. We gave him our old tickets in the back rows and he bumped us up, and told us our old tickets would go to charity (kids in the hospital or something, don’t remember clearly because of all the excitement).   Coldplay is my father and mines favorite band, so it was really the most amazing experience ever. I cried just about the whole time. Even ended up on the big screen. Can’t wait to go to another concert.
59942	0	a	Trey Parker and Matt Stone do something similar for their The Book of Mormon show. Front row is given away through free lottery before each show. They mentioned it was because they remembered when they were young and broke and couldn't afford to go to shows, this was their way of making it possible for young broke fans!  I was fortunate enough to win two front rows in London, best show ever. 
59943	0	a	I can’t speak for Billy Joel, but almost the same thing happened to me and my husband at a Blake Shelton concert.  We literally couldn’t have had worse seats and someone came along and moved our entire row to a section on the floor that was empty.  It wasn’t front row but it was a huge improvement over where we were at.  I always suspected something was up because why would a whole floor section have been kept empty. 
59944	0	a	Paul McCartney does this too! When I went to see him with my ex we were chosen by a scout to sit in the very front row. Best night ever.

A recognition of firmness. After all, he was toned to perfection from weeks of rebuilding a church in Rokoray, along the northern banks of the Great Scarcies River. He had met a woman there who reminded him of his sister. He cared for her, taught her a fledgling example of English, had even found himself feeling love for her. That was not a sisterly love however. Then again… was this?  He began to open his mouth. Any moment his parents would walk downstairs. The look on her face said they were on the same channel. Everything he had just thought, she heard it. He spoke.  “Listen, when mom and dad go out to say hi to the Gelsons next door tonight, let’s hang back, go upstairs and fuck the shit out of each other.”  “What?” She answered, bewildered.  “C’mon let's do it. Let’s fuck. Haven’t we always wanted this?” He reached out to reassure her, but she pulled away, fear in her eyes. “Whoa whoa. Uh no I’m just happy you’re home from Africa. What the hell are you talking about wanting to fuck me? Are you seriou--” And like a blade being hammered on the anvil, his father’s voice rang out from behind him: “WHAT IN SAM HILL IS GOING ON HERE?”  “I can explain…” he stammered, but was cut off by the visceral scream from his mother as she began sobbing into her bathrobe. His father erupted, white morning spittle shooting from the corners of his mouth.  “NO SON OF MINE IS GONNA DRINK FUCKING FOLGERS COFFEE!” He belted his son in the face, knocking the boy unconscious. “THIS IS A PEETS COFFEE HOUSE!”  Drink Peets Coffee.﻿"" -BMS https://youtu.be/Hv0gXgTPveg?t=2m37s"

60012	0	a	What a beautiful comment.
60013	0	a	Man, for me, it's because that's truly one of the only things we all have in common. We all are birthed and we will all die.  A lot of cultures have answers for what happens after death, but few actually prepare people for the act of dying. The fucked up part is that most of the time, we don't know when it will happen, but it's only a matter of time. The more time we spend here, the greater the chance we get hit by a bus, meteor, or by some coincidental lightening bolt after making a sacrilegious remark.  I fear the moment of death because of the unknown. Will it be painful or euphoric? I have no idea and that's the scary part. I want to think I'll go with grace and have left a legacy of decentness behind me.   The one thing I do know is that pain is temporary and I don't remember things before I was born. I anticipate the same for death and that's somehow comforting. I've helped a lot of dead people from my old profession and, to be honest, I've never heard a dead person complain.
60014	0	a	Such a smart way to allow positive physical contact. Everything is so strict these days, teachers can't hug their students, so letting them initiate and giving them options is a great way to allow those kids to get a little extra love if they need it!

60021	0	a	My son’s kindergarten teacher was exceptional, like her. Once during morning drop off she was greeting the children and a little girl pulled out a baby doll from her backpack to show her. Rather than a passing “that’s nice” the teacher stopped what she was doing to fuss over the doll. She asked if she could hold it and snuggled the doll like it was a real baby, told the little girl how cute and darling the doll was. She spent over a minute with the little girl and her doll. That little girl felt so, so special and important and validated. Now when children show me something of theirs I make a point truly to listen and acknowledge how special the object/whatever is.

Back in middle school I didn’t care and I never paid attention. That was until I was taught better.

60054	0	a	Male version would be probably more like this, which is pretty fantastic.  https://www.nbcnews.com/video/teacher-s-twist-on-a-high-five-has-students-smiling-867194947871?v=railb&  As a man, I just wouldn't let a hug be an option. Sadly that's the case. Though I can see why it's the case.
60055	0	a	I just had a group class in therapy about the negative impacts of childhood that carry in to adult life. There was a questionnaire, and if you scored at or higher than a 4 (out of 10), your likelihood of maladaptive behaviour as an adult skyrocketed, as well as health issues like COPD and autoimmune related conditions.  We then learned that if we had at least one positive and caring adult influence in our lives (as well as other outside influences), our resiliency score went up, meaning our ability to tolerate certain things easier, and possessing the ability to ask for help if we are in crisis.   This teacher, whether she knows it or not, is a hero, and will be the force in some of these children's lives that determine whether or not they are able to trust others, seek help, and cope as adults. This is what real power looks like.  EDIT: It's called the ACES questionnaire. I posted it as well as the resilience test for anyone interested here:   http://imgur.com/a/wVS1Rpc  The link can be found on the bottom page but I'm sure it's easily found in google. Good luck, I hope this helps a few people!

60069	0	a	I know someone who just started teaching 1st grade in a rougher school area.  The stories she has can be heartbreaking.  Some of these kids are already so handicapped by their home life.  Neglectful parents, parents who will start fights at school meets, horrid sleep schedules, little to no structure.  I wonder if these kids will rise above their circumstances and make something from nothing.  Its a shame that things can be so stacked against a 6 year old.  A good teacher might be the only positive thing in their lives.

60267	0	a	I grew up in a VERY white part of upstate New York. I took French in high school. I never understood why people always said Hispanics worked in kitchens because, from my experience, it was always white people.   When I moved to CT, I realized I was vastly underprepared for the mostly Spanish speaking kitchen staff. Unable to communicate with the dishwasher that I needed sanitizer, and tired of gesturing like a crazy person with a red bucket in my hand, I looked at him and with the most serious face I could manage, asked for”leche de chupacabra”.   He looked at me like i was absolutely crazy, but I just pointed to the bucket, pointed to the sanitizer bucket, and insisted it was called “the goat-sucker’s milk.” From then on, that was all it was called, and I was the dishwasher’s new favorite server. Almost seven years later, and he works at a different location, whenever I see him, I am still “mi amor”.

60351	0	a	My mom has systemic lupus and every once in a while when we were kids she'd have to spend a week or so at the hospital. The first time that happened when I was about 10 my dad ordered us kids outside to play while he made dinner. He came out of the house an hour later and announced we were going to Burger King. When we got back home he sent us straight to bed.  Later that night when I was creeping out of bed to get some water I found the kitchen *destroyed.* There was flour everywhere, something unidentifiable burnt in a pan sitting on the stove, the refrigerator door was left open, the sink was loaded with all kinds of bowls and pots, he even managed to get what looked like jelly on the floor with a footprint in it. I snuck past his room on my way back to bed and I heard him crying. That was the night I found out dads could cry.

60359	0	a	My mom was hospitalized two days before my sixth birthday with meningitis. The doctors told my dad & my grandparents that she most likely wasn't going to make it and they needed to prepare to lose her.  Everyone was obviously very focused on her, and not so much on me.  I had no idea how serious it was.  I remember my dad sitting me down and letting me know that we were going to have to skip my birthday this year and have it a little later, because mom was too sick.  I've since learned that he was so desperate that he tried to get himself and I both sick, so that the three of us could die together.  (Also I'm just now realizing that mom must have been about 5 weeks pregnant with my little brother, due to timing.  Holy shit.)  I spent most of that time coloring in the waiting room, and had for the most part gotten over my lack of birthday.  But then, very very late we got back from the hospital one night and my dad opened the front door to the house and presents just spilled out.  So, so many!  I was only 6 but the pile was bigger than me, and it was mindblowing.  Dad said the birthday gnomes must have done it.

I can picture the thought beforehand ""Oh no, the birthday cake, Wife used to do that. I guess I'll have to"", I can see him going to the shop to get the ingredients, picking out the recipe and trying to figure it out. All while feeling heartbroken himself that his wife isn't there to do it. And thinking back on the old memories."
60362	0	a	My sister did the same thing recently. Our mom passed in February, my birthday is in late March. Last year she had already been sick but still managed to make my favorite cake, Black Forest Gateau. My mom was a huge baker, worked in a cafe and all, but whenever I could chose the cake I’d go for that one. We gave most of her home baking stuff like her KitchenAid to her best friend who‘s a baker as well because we figured she’d get more use out of it. And well we have so much of my mom’s stuff, it was only fitting that she‘d get something too.   On my birthday my sister surprised me with a Black Forest Gateau, using our mom’s recipe and all. And sure it tasted a bit different, she used a bit too much Kirsch and it was still warm because she miscalculated how long it took, but I know my mom would have come back as a ghost and hit us if we celebrated with store bought cake. And it was delicious. We still have my mom’s recipe book and I know I’ll be baking some of our favorites along the way, definetly for my sisters birthday in August. Feels like a waste not to do so.

60364	0	a	"Thanks, it was difficult for him and us. This was in a different era before the internet and my father was absolutely clueless how to cook or clean and there was nowhere for him to look for answers. Back then men worked and took care of the outside of the house and women ran the household and all things inside. After sending us to school dirty with mismatched outfits and undone hair he gave up and got my grandmother to come by even though she lived far away.   I don't know if my parents knew my mom's diagnosis at that point, they didn't share information like that with us. Again, this was a different era and children were much more innocent then. They were expected to be shielded from the regular pains of life until they had to face them on their own as adults. That was the first time she went to the hospital and I think we were told that she was just ""sick.""   The second time she went in my father dropped us off at our other grandparents' house for the week. He had promised us if we were really good we could spend the week there which was a big deal because they lived in an giant Tudor by the sea. We were on our best behavior, which I now know was unnecessary wasted effort- we could have been little assholes and he would have brought us there anyway. We didn't find out my mom was in the hospital again until overhearing our grandparents talking about it. That was how we found out my mom had something called ""Lupus"" and was taking ""Pregnant Zone"" (Prednisone.) Neither of them came clean about the whole thing until we were teenagers though."
60365	0	a	No, I was young and scared. I told my twin I heard Dad crying and she thought maybe he hurt himself. I had my doubts, but that wasn't the first time we'd heard odd noises coming out of my parents' bedroom when the door was closed and my sister and I always came up with innocent and rather silly reasons why.   I don't remember how the kitchen got cleaned up but I *do* remember eating peas and hot dogs for dinner several times after that. My dad would just boil both, so it wasn't difficult. The only hang up was the dishes- I clearly remember eating peas off round plastic Tupperware container lids because there were no clean dishes left.

Most of us were fine and performing arts kids, and on the last day before finals this semester, he made it a point to say ""I know each and every one of you is going to be famous one day"". He was my FAVORITE teacher of all time and will always be my fav teacher. "

60422	0	a	I was a pretty good student. Not great, but pretty good. I got mostly B’s, a couple A’s and the odd C or D in classes I didn’t care about.  I took advanced physics my last year of high school. I still don’t know why because it was a dumb move. I never had any intention of pursuing anything physics related but I went for it.  The teacher was incredible. He cared and was positive and really tried to engage the class and make sure everyone was on board. I got an A, and was in the high 90’s on all my tests/exams/etc.  I’ll never forget Mr. Kouba. Best teacher I’ve ever had, and it’s not even close.

60429	0	a	What does he teach? 
60430	0	a	Its a big problem even in wealthy areas. I had professors at Penn State who were clearly only there for research money/resources and had absolutely zero interest in teaching classes. It was awful because they just slap a powerpoint together and ramble in the student's general direction without really trying to convey any point. The professors that cared had much higher success rates with their students even when teaching the exact same material(at least in my experience thats the way it appeared).  
60431	0	a	He would always smile and go slightly too fast cause of how excited he was. On the first day is what made me fall in love with him. He tells us he knows the realities of what college is like. Drugs drinking etc. He said that his house is always open if we needed something. He was my father figure this first semester and I've gained a new appreciation for music and especially classical music because of him. He would go on these weird rants that had nothing to do with class and I loved these. And you should hear him talk about his wife. He just had a huge amount of love and appreciation for things.

And then Adam Savage literally came on the post to comment that he was disappointed in reddit that day, lol. That was the first time I ever saw a real celebrity just pop into reddit and comment as themselves on a non-AMA post.

I honestly think we need *more* cabinet positions (like ""Secretary of Climate"", ""Secretary of Medical Research"", etc), and I want candidates to flesh out or get commitments from cabinet members *before* voting for them.   Voting for a President should really be about voting for a team, not just one person who says they can fix everything, because no one person can."

Watching movies with her is great. Telling her long stories is even more great because once I notice she's fallen asleep I'll start saying random stuff until she wakes up again 20 minutes later. Sometimes I wonder if she's faking and just really likes my bullshit stories.

60489	0	a	Thanks for asking! They got home yesterday to assess the damage. Bunch of debris in the yard. Contents of the garage had floated up about 3 feet, bobbed around, and came to rest in a mildewy pile when the water receded. They are the kind of people who use the garage as a catch-all and park in the driveway, so it's a daunting mess. My dad also had some nice antique woodworking stuff in there. Their house is thankfully in good shape. The surge stopped six inches short of their door. They don't have a basement but all the insulation in the crawlspace is soaked and trashed. The trees held out. My mom is feeling guilty about feeling relieved. A lot of their friends didn't fare as well. Haven't heard if their sailboat is okay (it was dry docked).
60490	0	a	If you have coin.
60491	0	a	Since she’s a grandma I can guarantee you that she loves your bullshit stories.  They don’t care if you’re telling them a story about a piece of bread you found or the time you went hiking with your friends. They just love you and love the fact that you want to share your stories with them.   Damn I love grandparents. 
60492	0	a	Try to tell her not to feel guilty, it's a really good thing that they're house and things are mostly ok; the garage stuff is just a good chance to sort through it all.   I know it's hard to be happy when your friends are going through a hard time, but please tell her to enjoy this one blessing. She now has spare energy to help those friends and others in the area who weren't so fortunate.   Hope fixing up the house and garage goes well for them and just wanted to add to have a beer yourself for giving them a place to stay. Nice to see families together when horrible things happen.   Hope you're all well, and best wishes from the UK.   
60493	0	a	Oh I meant bullshit stories like having to pay a troll to cross the bridge and my dogs fighting off a dragon. But still, yeah.
60494	0	a	Thank you for the kind words! You're absolutely right to embrace having energy and time to help others. They're offering their guest bedroom for use and I'm sure they'll pitch in with clean up. My mom actually went to NOLA after Katrina to help out. They like being helpful.

He was feeding her rich chocolate cake and letting her swig down Sprite. I was a mixture of awww how cute and oh man, all that work down the drain!   My grandfather told me that she went “Mmmmm” when she saw the cake on the table so he figured she knew what it was and wanted some.   Now that he’s gone I treasure that memory of him giving her the first taste of decadence.

60510	0	a	Indeed, this is not really a reaction to the chocolate or the milk, this is mostly a reaction to the sweetness of the sugar in it.

60524	0	a	I still remember getting my first pair of glasses at age 7. In the shop I said “so what is the difference?”  The optician took me outside the shop. I had never seen clouds. I had never seen birds. I had never seen the tops of trees. It was amazing.
60525	0	a	I've been wearing glasses since I was six and I've often wondered how different my life would have turned out without the help of corrective lenses. It's a humbling thought. I'm very happy for this baby who can see clearly for the first time.

60528	0	a	I was teaching in the infant room at a preschool years ago. We had one kiddo who at 10 months wasn’t crawling and was very easily upset.  We were worried she had a motor skill or cognitive delay and we tried every trick in our arsenal to help her.  Then she got glasses. Within a few weeks she was crawling, ~~cloning~~ Climbing and causing chaos on par with her peers. Turns out she was nearly legally blind. The world is a scary place when you can barely see it.  Best part is because she started correcting her vision so young she will probably have much better eyesight through her whole life.

I think I said something along the lines of “no nothing, though I probably shouldn’t have been driving with my old glasses” 
60532	0	a	I don't know if it was used here, but they have digital eye scanners now that can tell you your prescription without needing your input.

60537	0	a	It's always the leaves.
60538	0	a	Actually being able to see individual leaves instead of just one blob of green is the best feeling.
60539	0	a	The machine is called an autorefractor. They work by shining a light into the eye and looking into the eye to see how focused the light is on the retina. It then cycles through lenses until the light is focused properly, telling you the prescription needed. It's also quite fast so it can be used on babies who can't sit still for long.  edit: Another user with experience in the eye industry said that a different process called Retinoscopy is used on kids, their break down on the difference can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/arx7ks/baby_gets_glasses_and_can_see_clearly_for_the/egqn1su/)

60545	0	a	why isn't this in use for everybody? is it really expensive? i honestly have no idea what the correct answer is when the doctor asks me which of these two identical lenses is better or worse.. it always feels like a guessing game because i honestly can't tell.. so then i wonder if i don't have the optimal lenses for me..
60546	0	a	I got my glasses in the third grade too. I lived in NYC so while there weren’t many trees, seeing the design of buildings was amazing. Funnily enough, while leaving the optometrist I started looking at everything around me. I focused on a pothole across the street only to trip and fall on another one while I was crossing the road.
60547	0	a	Ya but vaccines and climate change are fake buddy don't forget ^/s

60572	0	a	I work in mental health and large amount of my clients come from abusive homes, whether biological or foster. So many mental health issues that may have never occurred if they simply had a nurturing environment. Seeing a little girl that thrilled to be brought into a loving home warms my heart. Her life may have been saved from whatever may have came down the line.   Edit:My highest comment ever, so I'm getting on my soap box. If you are considering adoption,  please do.  We have far more children than good parents. And teens are often left to trudge through the system. Please, if you are considering adoption,  remember that you may literally be their last hope.

I also read a lot about true crime and psychology and heard so many sad stories about the damage a bad home can have.  All this is to say that I live for moments like the one in this video even if I can't be a part of them myself. So touching.

60594	0	a	Thank you!!!   I’m usually feeling great and ready to kick the day in the face but I think I’m just a little down because my hubby is working a few states away this week so I’m a single mom for a few more days and just having a hard time because I didn’t sleep well, my baby is teething so she isn’t really eating well and is feverish, just normal crap like that.  I usually work out while she naps but i was feeling so down today that I thought I would skip it and just nap instead knowing that it was gonna make me feel worse later.   You have made me feel so much better that I think I’m gonna at least start working out and see how far I get.  Thanks for taking a minute out of your day to send me some positive energy!  I truly am feeding off of it.  Thank you, my friend.

I know it feels like a never-ending slog towards futility and uselessness, but it won't always! Whether it's finding the right person, the right career, the right hobby, the right friends, or hell, the right combination of meds and therapy, there will come a time where it's not going to feel this helpless. You're almost to the next *huge* step in your life, but you gotta keep working at it. If you can't keep working at what you're trying to do now, make a change. Make a BIG change if you need to. But don't give up before even trying.   You aren't useless, you aren't a burden, and you do matter.

So struck by it, it stayed with me, that I've never seen him laugh. Not in public, not in private. And at a dinner with someone -- I mean, I'm not a comedian but I occasionally say something that's funny that people chuckle with each other.  But I never saw anything that resembled a laugh. And I could over-interpret that, I could be -- also, we're missing something that -- that maybe he's -- he's breaking up in stitches with other people other than the FBI director, but I also tried -- after I got fired, I thought -- that stayed with me. And so I went and tried to find examples of videos where he's laughing and I could only find that really wasn't a genuine laugh.

But the entire thing is awesome, he just basically gave out a bunch of good advice on being a good man and a good human being.  Obama made it a point that strength isn't what you wear or how you flaunt your riches. His strength is internal, and I respect that.

Ended up jumping in my car to chase him down. He was very grateful. When he grabbed the cash I saw his hand was wrapped in duct tape which I imagine was due to injury. No matter how bad things are, someone always has it worse. "

60660	0	a	This is awesome. I haven’t told my wife, kids, friends etc and don’t think I ever will but about a month ago I was getting gas and grabbed some stuff inside the store when I heard a woman behind me come in all stressed saying she gave attendant $2 for gas on pump 3 but it wasn’t working, he told her to move to pump 2 but was not very accommodating. It was early morning I was tired and grumpy so I ignored it. When I walked out I could see she was visibly upset taking to herself about the pump not working and overall distressed. I asked if she needed anything and she told me how she gave the attendant $2 but couldn’t get pumps to work. She was starting to tear up and talking about needing to get her sister to dialysis appointment and just needed the pumps to work- I told her I would get her gas, pulled out my CC and started pumping. Over the next 2 mins she was super upset, was in town from Tennessee (I live in KC) staying with her dying mom, taking her sick sister to the Dr and was just at the end of the rope. She was on fumes and as bill rises she kept saying that’s all I need - I just need to get to midtown, she was blown away when tank topped off at $56 and kept asking for my biz card to send me money. I was happy to be fortunate enough to help a stranger truly in need and never expected a penny. I never thought I would tell that story until I saw this.   Good men these bros are.

60670	0	a	There was a homeless guy outside a convenient store around the corner from my house. When I walked out i had 2 scratch offs in my hand and he asked me for some change for a bus ticket. I said I’m sorry, I don’t have any. I got in my vehicle and scratched off the ticket and I had a $2 winner. He was still sitting there so I rolled my window down and gave it to him. I watched him go inside and left.  My mind wondered if he’d taken the cash or bought another ticket or a 32 oz with it. I went about my business and drove back by about twenty minutes later and he was standing at the bus stop waiting for  the bus.  He did not lie, dude needed a bus ticket. He was also very grateful.  Now I actually keep a new package of socks in my truck and give them to homeless people when I’m stopped on a corner.    There was an ask Reddit thread I read one time and the question was “people of reddit who have been homeless, what are some misconceptions about your life when you are homeless?” One of the top answers was, “OMG we always need socks! You have no idea how wonderful a new pair of socks make your quality of life”. Socks are cheap, so I figure I can do this to make that extra little contribution to society.

60689	0	a	There is this homeless man at my local Safeway and one night I decided to buy us both some dinner and sat outside and ate/talked with him. (I’ve always been interested in hearing homeless people’s stories.) As I sat down, he was confused at first, so I said, “I thought you would like some company.” He then started crying because apparently his dog, the only living thing he would have a conversation with, died the week before. This was his first conversation with anything since then. I was so stunned by this realization, that now I have dinner with him 2-3 times a week if he’s there at the same spot on the ground at that Safeway.  I cannot image how awful it must be to not have someone to talk with. It’s astounding how a simple thing can mean the world to someone else.  EDIT: Thank you kind sir/madam for the silver! I was not expecting that at all. That’s the first time I’ve gotten something like that on Reddit!
60690	0	a	"I've been in a similar position. I don't care if they brought a whole camera crew, I would have been appreciative to eat something that I didn't either steal or dig out of the trash. It pisses me off (not you, just people who say this shit in general) to see people say shit like ""You gave someone $100 but you probably made more than that in views"" or ""If you're going to do it for selfish reasons, don't do it at all. It's exploitative.""  On my mama, I don't care about your reasons or motivations, and neither do countless people out there on the street that need help every single day just to stay alive. There are people out there sucking dick in back alleys for formula to feed their baby. You think they care about being on youtube? Society has failed them. Let them enjoy a brief respite from their hardships. They're not the ones ruining the act of kindness. People that would discourage others that might want to do the same are, and that's a lot more damaging that pointing a camera at someone at the first moment they've felt genuine happiness in likely a very long time, no matter how brief that feeling is. "
60691	0	a	  I’ve always believed that we need to set aside all the old labels (e.g. colour, race, religion etc.) that have divided us. What (to me) really matters is if a person seeks to be kind, compassionate and “good” or if they prefer to (sadly) do harm and foster evil.  In watching this, I thought that these young men, irrespective of why they were recording video, reached out to someone because they could see she was in need and then that she was in terrible pain...and they offered kindness and charity. This puts them in the “good” group - for me. :-)  Nothing else matters, except perhaps that the kindness continues and grows as others consider their example.      
60692	0	a	I've never felt older by saying this, but it seems like anyone under 20 records everything they do.
60693	0	a	And for the many homeless people who have severe mental issues their dog is often the only living being they are able to have a connection with.
60694	0	a	We had a local guy who’s dog was always borderline fat when this guy was looking like he was starving. Turns out that local businesses were also more likely to feed his dog than him, which he gratefully accepted. His dog ended up freezing to death in his sleeping bag one year.  Made me realize just how shitty my tiny hillbilly town really was despite being “good Christian folk” I worked at a pizza place at the time and occasionally a whole large pizza would get “fucked up” for both of them. I hope he’s ok.
60695	0	a	While I agree those things shouldnt divide us, I think they should bring us together.  We should be happy to share our differences! To spread the stories and meals and clothing and traditions our great great grandparents gave us!  We are different, and it's not a bad thing. Rather than saying it doesn't matter, we should say it isn't a bad thing.   But I agree it's totally useless to point out in this situation.

60698	0	a	Dude, my ex girlfriends family used to cage their dogs. I had never seen that before. That was fucked. It's like.. WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU HAVE LARGE DOGS and then keep them in cages in your room? And they were the sweetest dogs too. Pissed me off. 
60699	0	a	Yeah, I had two German Shepherds in a small house. They were outside most of the time in the fenced yard with their dog houses. But would be kept inside at night and when we weren't home. There was rarely an issue, other than the occasional digging through trash.  But I know someone that got a dog and would cage it. I thought that was insane, but when they tried to not crate, the dog destroyed everything.  So yes, it may be due to shitty owners, but maybe it's because some dogs are too destructive when unsupervised.
60700	0	a	As a dog trainer and owner of three Belgian mals.  Puppies are destructive.  Dog properly exercised both physically and mentally are not destructive.  Adult dogs destroy things because they are bored/have too much energy.  If you cage your dog and don't properly exercise them they become destructive.
60701	0	a	My dog has severe separation anxiety which makes him destructive and likely to pee and poop in the house (which he has literally never done once other than pre house breaking). I built a large 15ftx15ft Kennel for him in the basement during the winter months so he at least has room to stretch his legs and walk around a little when the weather doesn't let me leave him outside. It's not always just a lack of training.

And they got the money, but they decided to spend it raising us instead of getting a new ring. We are all in college/graduated now, and are more financially independent of them. So it was the perfect timing.   Also here’s the ring for those of you that asked :)  https://i.imgur.com/9FlOJOq.jpg

60723	0	a	My aunt lost her diamond ring in the front yard of my grandparents place. Grandpa got everyone off the lawn and banned anyone from walking there the rest of the evening. As soon as it was dark out he went out with a flashlight and found the ring within a minute in the yard. When the beam hit it it lit up like a beacon, also the reason he made us all stay off the grass was so we wouldn't accidentally press it into the dirt while looking for it.  He was a smart old guy.
60724	0	a	My wife dropped her ring down the drain at a hotel. She freaked and didn't say anything since she had it maybe a year at that point. I had to take the P trap apart which seemed it was never cleaned ever. I found the ring stuck in a lump of something I never want to learn was made of and cleaned it later in a sonic bath. 
60725	0	a	My step mom lost her diamond from her ring while in a crowded indoor water park. My cousin and I decided to look for it and lo and behold I found it shining at the bottom of a pool filled with people. Still can’t believe how lucky we got. Imagine being someone else in that pool and finding a big ole diamond. 
60726	0	a	My mom lost her diamond one day in the kitchen, my dad took apart the trap in the sink to no avail. Eventually, maybe ten years later when they had enough money they bought a new ring. She still had the old setting. Then one day, 20 years after she had lost the diamond she found it in a crack between two pieces of linoleum in the flooring. She couldn’t believe that she had washed that floor for 20 years and never seen it.

She gave me some time to think about it, and my response was that I knew she and my dad loved me. She was over the MOON about it, because apparently it was some thought experiment some other friends got from a professor.  She asked my brother the same thing and he said ""I know I can beat up a baby.""  Honestly.  Edit: For context, he was in his twenties at the time."
60753	0	a	Man, I really hope he pulls through it alright. He seems like he’s a really good guy, and while seeing this was sad it made me smile still. It’s the little things like this that can make the biggest difference to someone, especially in their time of need. Best of wishes to you guys

60755	0	a	My dad sends me the same message every morning.  Keep it up! I’m serious. Tell him every day. It keeps me going.
60756	0	a	He's been the rock of our family for as long as I can remember, so it's honestly such an honor to be able to help him in any way.  Edit: Wow, thank you for the gold!    My dad's not a Reddit guy (I'm working on that) but I told him he's a celebrity on here now and he said he's bummed that he doesn't get to sign autographs. Now I have to explain to him that some people have enjoyed this post so much that they paid actual money to put virtual gold medals on it. He's gonna get a kick out of that!   Edit 2: I've had a really hard time keeping up with this but I just wanted to say THANK YOU to everyone wishing my family well, sharing their wonderful stories, and for being all around really nice human beings.    There are some people who think my dad's comment was a dig at my mom, but I can guarantee you that's not the way he meant it. He's had to ask his kids for a lot of help lately, which he hates doing, and he's had to be extremely vulnerable with us. We've assured him time and time again that we want to help him and that it's good for him to ask. These texts were following a really rough day of figuring out legal paperwork and things he needed to do and all of us kids were there, in person, helping him. I honestly think he's just overwhelmed by our love and support right now and THAT'S where this comment came from.

60761	0	a	He's one of the best people I've ever known. Not without flaws of course, but he's unfailingly kind and loving. Basically the polar opposite of my mom. My brothers and I are doing everything we can to help and support him!
60762	0	a	My mom has always been a pretty terrible person. I've tried many times to... Help her, but she's in her own world where she's never wrong and always the victim and her favorite pastime is belittling people. My brothers and I tried to do a conference call with her a while ago to try to figure out what on earth she was thinking and try to get her to see any kind of reason, but it only lasted for a few minutes before she hung up. We've all given up hope that we'll have a healthy relationship with her ever again, not that we really did before...

60781	0	a	Never seen the full gif of this. That extra 10 seconds really delivers the drama. 
60782	0	a	Her trying to use that cleaver makes my butthole pucker. Not safe. The way to use the knife properly is use the butt bottom to jab a hole in the lid. It will depressurize the jar and make it easy to open. 
60783	0	a	My nightmare would be me being the dad in that situation only being unable to open the jar. I’m trying to imagine what I would do then, but I have no idea. Give the jar back to her with an apologetic shudder? Is there any option? The rest of the group would be staring at me wasting my daughter precious seconds. I already failed as a father and I’m not even one yet

60797	0	a	This is how my buddy did after he and his girlfriend had an argument.  They'd sorta not talk to each other for a bit.  So he would secretly tighten the jars in the kitchen and she would eventually ask him to open one.  Then they would talk again and and usually work through their argument eventually.  
60798	0	a	Yeah she only went to dad when she NEEDED him and that’s like a true “daddy’s girl” not that pretty princess crap 
60799	0	a	My favorite bit is the way the dad holds onto the lid from the jar and briefly looks down at it like fuck guess I'm holding onto this for the rest of the competition. 
60800	0	a	I guarantee you she started increasing her grip strength after that show. Never know when you’ll need it. 
60801	0	a	Cool. Didn’t know getting external help was allowed in these kind of stuff.
60802	0	a	Hi! I'm stress and I'll make you do terrible things! 
60803	0	a	The vacuum seal on the lid is making it very difficult to turn. By wedging the cleaver between the lid and the rim of the jar, the chef can break the seal by essentially using the knife as a lever to separate the two.  Generally, this is an unsafe and stupid thing to do, since you can also thwack the lid a few times with the spine of the knife - Introducing dents in the lid will break the vacuum and allow you to open the jar much more easily. 
60804	0	a	All she had to do was use it to make the smallest imaginable hole in the lid to release the vacuum in the jar holding the lid fast. I do this at home for those extraordinary situations where I cannot open a lid with my manly grip.
60805	0	a	I bet he's cool with it. He's gonna put it in the drawer where he keeps all the shitty mugs and ashtrays she made for him in elementary school.  That's a proud Dad.

60807	0	a	The look on his face when he looks at his hand.. 'i promised I would never use my powers again'
60808	0	a	Yea, before I was like, hey that's pretty cool that she thought to go to her dad.  But now it's like, you can see the fear in her and her parents eyes and the build up to the dad just charging all his dad strength to get that jar open to end his daughters suffering for the moment she decides to runs up.
60809	0	a	I always just hit the edge of the lid, with a blunt object, a few times to create a couple dents. It usually breaks the seal or weakens it and then the lid comes right off. 
60810	0	a	That's actually not an option in the cosmic rules, even if you tried you would still have had opened that jar for your daughter, maybe not for your wife, but your daughter gives you that jar and if your start struggling you'd black out for a second and then wonder why the Jar is open and your hand doesn't want to move anymore.
60811	0	a	I’m sure you will be. 
60812	0	a	Disagree, she probably just thought it was against the rules and then just decided to say fuck it

60830	0	a	I just tap the lid on the counter - all the way around until it loosens. It hasn't failed me in half a century. 
60831	0	a	They have “helpers”  (for example, on season 1, 2 cooks didn’t know how to use the pressure cooker, and one contestant had broke her ~~foot~~ toe), they can help by getting ingredients/pans/etc. Only thing they cannot do is cook for them. Elisa could have asked for one of those helpers who were closer, but instead, she asked for her father who was at the other side of the room. Pure love (:
60832	0	a	“Well, your recipe was amazing and executed perfectly. The taste and look of your dish was far superior to the other competitors’. HOWEVER... you did not open the jar of pickles on your own, and thus you are disqualified from the competition.”

60834	0	a	God damn it, dad.
60835	0	a	I always feel like a badass pirate when I stab the jar with a knife when my wife can't open it. I don't know why but there is something satisfying in piercing that lid.  I have little kids and they look at me like I'm the strongest man alive, that helps  My wife hates it, that helps too

60850	0	a	That would suck and not really be in the spirit of the show.  Would it really mean she was not the better chef just because she couldn't get a jar open even after wasting a considerable amount of time fighting with what was apparently an over sealed lid?  I'm no chef though, so maybe getting these things open does require some sort of skill they should all possess.

Here’s the conversation I overheard:    “Hey, somebody left their sunglasses here.”    “Wow, those look expensive.”    “Yeah, let’s put them here on the counter where the owner can find them. Somebody’s missing these.”  Band kids are awesome.

I spoke up and asked her if they were for a special occasion. She replied they were for her mom’s birthday. I asked the cashier to just ring them up with my order and told the girl to take her mom some flowers.   Her eyes teared up and she ran over and gave me a big hug. That was awkward but I felt good about the situation 
60896	0	a	I tried to do that once when I was working at the desert stand at a ballpark.

The tills are out or over at the end of the night by a couple bucks here and there anyways so it evens out. Corporate Walmart can afford that. I wasn't going to tell them they couldn't have an item because they were pennies short.

61087	0	a	Hundreds? I'll bet the number is in the thousands in the United States alone, where maternity leave isn't even a guarantee, and paternity leave is laughed right out of any conversation about labor rights.

61089	0	a	This isn’t true. You are very wrong. You must be full time, have been employed for a year, and the company must have at least 50 employees.   “Employees are eligible for leave if they have worked for their employer at least 12 months, at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles. Whether an employee has worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined according to FLSA principles for determining compensable hours or work.”  One of my close friends was let go from her job after giving birth, and it was completely legal. The  company we worked for had 46 employees.

Most of the time they'll go along and start the motion of the game and since you caught them off guard, they have no time to think and they keep their fist closed and play rock 8/10 times.

61126	0	a	there's another video about this guy that I saw here recently. In that video, he goes into parks and talks to homeless people and lets them know that there's food at his restaurant and they should come and have a meal. Truly a great man and I can't wait to eat at his restaurant when I go to DC.

61135	0	a	Quran says And they give (their own) food, in deep love of Allah, to the needy, the orphan and prisoner (out of sacrifice, despite their own desire and need for it),  (And say:) ‘We are feeding you only to please Allah. We do not seek any recompense from you nor (wish for) any thanks.►{Surah Al- Insan Chapter 76: Verse 8-9}   Mentioned in Hadith  Abdullah ibn ‘Amr(Radiyallahu Anhu) said, “A man asked the Prophet(Peace be upon him), ‘Which aspect of Islam is best?‘  He said, ‘FEEDING PEOPLE and greeting those you know and those you do not know.'”►{Sahih Bukhari,Kitab Al-Iman,Hadith #12}  In a hadeeth reported by Abu Moosa Ash’ari (Radiyallahu anhu), The Prophet (Peace be upon him) said ,“FEED THE HUNGRY, visit the sick and free the captives” ►{ Narrated by Imam Bukhari }  Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,  “He who eats to satisfaction while his neighbour is hungry is not a mumin.” ►{Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi,Al-Sunan Al-Kubra,Vol. 10,Pg.3,Hadith #19452}  He says, he is doing as worship to ALLAH May ALLAH bless him...

61136	0	a	Give that man a freakin’ public forum and let him spread the word. Lifting others up is what we should all be doing 
61137	0	a	How is this even sustainable? I figured he'd have a line around the block with homeless people by now.  E: Getting a ton of the same responses below, so here:  *  The boxes are small and only cost 1-2 dollars considering he buys wholesale and cooks in bulk, so it's negligible  *  He would have thrown it out at the end of the day anyway, so it's 100% negligible  *  He is making more money than he is losing because of the extra business he gets from people hearing of his philanthropic deeds  *  He is a saint and living like a pauper because of it and just doesn't mind because he loves helping so much  *  ~~There aren't very many homeless people here because it's by the WH~~  *  It's meat and rice, thus dirt cheap and barely affects his costs if at all  E2: Getting a lot of notes that there are plenty of homeless around the WH, which *I fucking thought,* but I'm not from DC so I took other people's word for it. It's off the list!
61138	0	a	He’s been doing this for years, he’s got it covered.  What a great person (soul).  Anecdote:  Louis IX (Saint Louis) did this every Sunday.  
61139	0	a	I believe, as it seems he does and has shown, that the vast majority of people wouldn't abuse this. It's part of the lesson he's trying to impart.
61140	0	a	100% me too, and I'll leave the biggest tip I ever have. I don't drive by dc often, maybe once a year.  But  next time I do I'm definitely eating there.  I think he deserves every kind of exposure possible. 
61141	0	a	Also 16,000 meals worth of leftovers that don't get thrown out at the end of the day :) 
61142	0	a	It's not Middle Eastern food. It's a Pakistani restaurant so South Asian (Pakistani) food.
61143	0	a	Depends. If I had a choice between two places, one that charges $9 for a meal and isn't doing this, and one that charges $11 and is doing this, I'd go to the place for $11. If locals are aware of it, they're probably supportive.            Alternatively, the place is doing really well and he's got enough of a profit margin to eat into.             My worry would be that he's got no profit margin because of it, and is spending everything to sustain the business, pay his staff, and forgoing the ability to grow/pay for anything past his base needs. In which case, he should set up a Patreon or something similar. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would be happy to give a few dollars a month to help him continue what he's doing.
61144	0	a	During lunch, they have a buffet, I think it’s like $15 or $20, all you can eat.  Their food is amazing.  Source: I’ve been here twice for company lunches. 
61145	0	a	I think it's well within his profit margin. With restaurants not being ~~able~~ *willing* to donate leftover food at the end of the day, this is a good way around it.  My main concern is him being able to sustain the practice once this goes viral. Hopefully he will get more paying business because of it, and I'm sure that he will.  Edit: Restaurants and grocery stores are protected by the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act against being sued if someone gets sick. In my personal experience, a lot of business owners I've talked to are not aware of this or are using ignorance as an excuse for the main reason they don't donate: **It's a logistical issue they don't want to spend time or resources dealing with it when they can just throw it out.** Which is truly unfortunate. 
61146	0	a	It also looks like a small portion he's giving away, looks like a small salad box, so it's not like he's giving massive portions.   A lot of food probably goes to waste by the end of the week so I don't think it's eating that much into his margins. 
61147	0	a	America's hunger and homeless problems are all artificial. We have so much cheap food wasted. We have more empty houses than we do homeless people. The problem is not being solved because we don't want to solve it.   (and since I came to the states a decade ago, I noticed that the culture tends to hate and look down on homeless people rather than pity them, which was a shock).
61148	0	a	That's pretty awesome.  Pros mark their balls so it is basically handing the kid an autograph as well.

61150	0	a	I once had a customer-service job in retail store and met a man named John who was in his 90s, and a frequent customer. He was always very kind and stopped to chat when he would see me working.   One day, quite randomly he asked “do you like golf?” to which I responded “yes! I grew up next to a course a have been playing since I was a kid.” He lit up when I told him that and said “Wonderful! I’ll bring you some golf balls. I am to old to play anymore and I have lots of golf balls I don’t need.” I chuckled at the gesture and told him I looked forward to that, not really thinking he ever would.   Every day I saw him after that, he would pull a golf ball out of his pocket and hand it to me with a big smile. It always made my day. Mostly from seeing the joy it seemed to give him.   I saw his wife in the store one day without him, so I asked “where is John today?” to which she  solemnly replied that he had just passed away only 2 days earlier.   I didn’t really know him well but I was very sad that he had passed. I went to his funeral visitation and left a golf ball at his casket.   Sometimes small gestures can leave a lasting impact and you don’t have to be a golf pro to make someone’s day.   Edit: to the kind stranger who gave me gold: Thank you, that small gesture made my day. 
61151	0	a	I really wish I was famous so that the simplest thing I do could bring people the same amount of happiness that that kid had at that moment.
61152	0	a	At first, I thought he gave him a tissue haha.
61153	0	a	I had a similar experience when I was a kid at the 1996 Senior PGA Open. Arnold Palmer was playing and I really wanted to give him a high five. He walked over and shook my hand, and gave me a ball he was playing with. I was pretty elated, but we had a connection at the golf course and they asked if I wanted to get the ball signed by Arnold after the match.   Unfortunately, Arnold refused to sign the ball. He had signed a few items recently that had ended up on eBay, and he wasn't fond of people profiting off of his signature. Instead, he said I could hold onto the ball, and that he'd send me something special.  A few weeks later, I received a copy of his score-card, and a picture of him with a personal note that included my name (to make it special, and so I couldn't resell it easily) and a note of encouragement.   It was such a thoughtful gesture, and I'll always remember Arnold as a true gentleman, and one of the finest representatives of the sport that ever lived. I still have the picture, ball, and score card hanging on my wall back home.  
61154	0	a	He’s going to have that for life... until some hateful harlot he married wins it in the divorce. It’s not even that valuable, she just knows how much it means to him.

61161	0	a	What a beautiful story. Thank you for sharing! I can only imagine the joy it gave John as well, sharing his passion with you.
61162	0	a	"That's so sweet! When I was in grad school I spent some time volunteering at a local nature trail. Just sat in the cabin, greeted people, sold souvenirs, etc. There was a sweet old man who came to walk all the time. His wife was suffering from some kind of dementia in her old age; but he said the one thing she liked to do was read a lot of books. He often saw me reading while I was working and offered to bring me some books his wife was done with. The next time I came in, there was a large paper bag inside the cabin with ""To Snowbank_Lake, From Buster"" written on it (he had come by during someone else's shift and left it with them). The bag was full of romance novels! lol. He had no idea that was what they were. Next time he saw me he said ""Yeah, there's a western in there... "" (referring to a romance novel that takes place in Texas and therefor has a cowboy-looking guy on the cover). I actually did read a few of them. But it warmed my heart to picture this sweet older man with his cane walking to the trail with this bag of books for me."
61163	0	a	You can.  Take 2 minutes after consuming content of some sort (YouTube, minor Facebook scrolling, a Reddit comment, whatever) and send the person a private message letting them know you were thinking of them and you appreciate something about their existence.    In the age of digital, communication has become much more easy but for some reason the simple act of saying hello to a random person you haven't talked to in awhile has been thrown away.  A long time ago, I had a pen pal and I'd hear from them every 2-3 months.  For some reason I thought as the internet grew, I'd have dozens of pen pals.  What I ended up having was a series of lives to consume without adding value.  I decided awhile ago to break down the consumption without value and write tiny notes.    Have a great day, stranger and if you'd like, you can start sending little notes of joy to those you encounter in your digital travels.

Some of us played the sport and want to see the best of the best plays, similar to why so many people what esports.

61186	0	a	Nothing more romantic than screeching kids in the background :D   But tbh, this is really cute. Most kids at my former school would have laughed and would have tried to ruin the moment. This is really sth, especially if both of them are teachers. I wish them all the best :)
61187	0	a	This reminds me of my teachers back in high school! Our class set up our English teacher and the history teacher / football coach on a date. It started as kind of a joke because they were the only two younger, single teachers in a very small town. But it must have worked, because they are now married with two adorable kids, and when I look back on it, I get all the feels. Wish these two teaching lovebirds the best!
61188	0	a	Loved this.  Although you would have to be pretty sure she would say yes.

61195	0	a	Seriously. You can actually hear the kids shushing each other right before the proposal. No one in that room was going to be ruining that moment.
61196	0	a	This was a great idea for a number of reasons, but I suspect some thought went into showing kids a healthy, happy life moment.   This would have gone a long way in helping me develop had I seen it as a child. The only male-female romantic relationship I really knew consisted of fear and abuse. It's very confusing to be isolated as a child and to only see a corrupt, horrific marriage based on hate, control, and terror. I didn't understand how life was supposed to work at all.   I had nice teachers, but I never saw them in their own lives. I just saw the outer-world presentation.  My family had masks for the outer world too, so I had trouble reconciling real people and their public identities, which I thought were 100% fake.   Why the fuck am I telling you people this? I guess I'm encouraging teachers to let their students see them as real human beings.

61220	0	a	Just a heads up for anyone that cares about checking into the ethics behind something before unabashedly fawning over it: with pituitary dwarfism, this dog is looking at a drastically shortened lifespan (often 5 years tops), and daily medications (primarily attempts at hormone replacement) to help alleviate some of the problematic side effects of their condition. So it’s not a benign condition in the least.   It’s caused by a recessive gene, so can pop up unexpectedly. But any responsible breeder needs to spay the dog that produces any pituitary dwarves and ensure the puppies from the litter are speutered as well, because even the normal looking ones can be carriers.   It seems like many breeders haven’t been willing to take these types of measures though, and dwarves are born more often than one would assume. You don’t see many out in the world as adults because they are often humanely euthanized due to the immense amount of vet care they require to live somewhat comfortably with their condition.   It goes without saying that breeding them on purpose or wishing that someone would breed them on purpose is not ethical. If someone is dead set on a small fluffy pointy eared creature, then they should just get a Pomsky or some other type of “lesser evil.”  ETA: no shade @ the owner of the dog. Last paragraph is directed at any people who like the look of this dog but wouldn’t want to support animal suffering by actively seeking out (i.e. creating a demand for) a pituitary dwarf canine.

61240	0	a	"this is my girlfriend and me. the video is like 3-4 years old. she gets startled because i lived 2 hours away from her so she was like ""what the fuck!"" when i would arrive. these videos are shot months apart and we were planning on hanging those days anyways, i would just show up earlier while she was still working to mess with her. she got a kick out of it. we’re still happily together. just got back from a fun trip in LA   thanks again for the share!  edit: [here’s a recent video of me scaring her a bunch with my old trumpet](https://youtu.be/eEeuygaSsS0) "

61249	0	a	How did you show up like 20 minutes after this video was posted in some random subreddit?  Edit: couple of people have suggested this whole thing is probably a setup to promote dude's twitch account. Since the imgur post doesn't link back here and the chance of him finding it on this sub a few (14!) minutes after it was posted are slim to say the least, the only thing that makes sense is either OP messaged him after he posted it (which really makes no sense), or it was prearranged to get people onto his twitch.  Not that I'm saying there's anything wrong with that. It is what it is.   Edit2: apparently the twitch link has been removed at mods request.

Occasionally I'd have to go to his area and check that he's alive and I learned very early that he scares easily. So everytime I'd go and check on him I'd sneak in (which wasn't hard since the machines are loud) and I'd grab him! He'd scream and we'd have a good laugh about it. Even though I always did these ""life checks"" every hour on the hour he never got used to my scare strategy. "

61265	0	a	it was trending on imgur so i went on reddit to find the original post.  edit: i can see why people would think that but it's 100% not true. this specific video has been shared so many fucking times all over the place. imgur, ifunny, youtube, reddit, instagram on every meme account. i figured everyone had seen it by now. it's gone viral on reddit several times over the past few years. someone reached out to my girlfriend that the gif was trending on imgur. we checked it out and saw it was doing well. i figured there was probably a reddit post since that's how it has always worked out. i've been on reddit for over 8 years so this isn't really new to me. i saw it was on /r/funny and /r/mademesmile (i had no idea made me smile was even a subreddit)  so i tossed a comment on it not expecting much since it didn't really have any upvotes. 30 minutes later i started to see it growing....a lot. that's when i did some edits and added the youtube link to another recent scare video and my twitch because i was going live tonight anyways and figured if anyone wanted to talk live about my videos etc. they could.  i def have no idea who the OP of this post is....as well as the person who turned my video into a gif with subtitles.

61273	0	a	Huh - [the video was posted on imgur](https://imgur.com/rxvW2S0) six hours ago - apparently OP saw it about five hours later and posted it here.  Ah, OP has almost 2 million karma from taking whatever's trending on imgur and reposting it on reddit. Not that I'm calling pitchforks, just thought it was interesting.   Edit: Hold up, you showed up ~~twenty~~ 14 minutes after it got posted here? How would you even find it? Seems unlikely. As a few people have pointed out, seems like this thread was set up for you to promote your twitch account. **Not that there's anything wrong with that**, interesting to see how advertising works on reddit now.

61278	0	a	It was part of it. We'd both have a sheet of paper that we have to give to the Health and Safety Officer in the morning that said we made visual contact every hour and the exact time contact was made. It was a chemical plant that produced highly toxic chemicals, some which could easily burn skin or kill a person if inhaled so the potential of him being seriously injured, incipacitated or killed was very real. 
61279	0	a	I read a post from Chris that the delayed reactions are because he lived 2 hours away at the time, so she would initially be startled when someone approached her, and startled again when she realized it was him
61280	0	a	The more surprising thing is that an imgur person knew that Reddit exists

61285	0	a	Question about this. How is the interval between checks determined? It seems like some of the things in the factory are deadly enough that if you aren't there pretty much as it happens the guy is a goner. Shouldn't some of the activities that are particularly dangerous run on a buddy system instead? Also was the check more preventative i.e. you see them kind of tired and make sure they don't engage in the more dangerous activities or more reactive i.e. the company doesn't want a dead guy to not be found for a while?  I'm pretty curious about this from a logistical standpoint. If I'm totally off base with my understanding please let me know. Thanks!

61289	0	a	Hey u/fattehboi, is she single?
61290	0	a	X
61291	0	a	The interval was more than likely determined so as not to be too inconvenient to us as we both had other duties to perform and an hour seems like enough time to allow me to do my other work and still check on him fairly regularly.  The more dangerous duties are done during the day, the guys that did this are all chemists and during the day there was a staff of about 20-30 depending on orders working in that part of the factory. Before the day guys would go home they'd make sure that all the major work was done and overnight the machines would mix, boil and do whatever else they did mostly automatically. The night guy would sit in the supervisors office and monitor all the computers that were displaying data on the operations of the machines, occasionally they required some service. Some of the 'settings' could be changed on the computer others would require him to go an manually open a depressurizatuon valve or other little nobs that needed adjusting. 90% of his job required no unusual safety procedures as anyone could do it without PPE. The other 10% was the dangerous part and required the mixing and adding of chemicals to facilitate the desired reaction. My office and his both had screens that displayed the cameras in the plant so I'd keep an eye on him and make sure to watch him closely when I saw him putting on a hazmat suit, knowing that's when I might need to help him. He also has a radio of course so he could contact me in an emergency. On nights when things were less busy, I facilitated the trucks and tankers that came to deliver or drop off product, I'd go and sit in their office and when I started working there I peppered them with questions about how everything worked because it was really very interesting.  The checks were certainly reactive. A depressing idea but thankfully none that anyone has ever had to run into. The administration overseeing labour related injuries has never been called for a death and the emergency eye wash and shower systems have only ever been turned on for tests.   The good news there has never been a lost time injury in the chemical processing division of the plant. It sounds unsafe but it really was a very safe place to work. The Health and Safety Officer was known to review overnight camera footage to make sure that everyone was following the rules and requests for additional safety equipment or measures were taken very seriously and acted upon quickly (policy was to take action no more than 30 days from the date the request was filed). 
61292	0	a	Well, I work in a library and get approached by users all the time, yet I still startle almost always whenever someone goes and asks me something.

61298	0	a	This guy is a local hero:  When he was a kid he had a major surgery, requiring a big donation of blood. Upon recovery, he made a vow to start donating blood as soon as he could (I think it was from 18 not 14 but doesn't matter).  After the first few donations, Doctors learned that his blood contained unusually strong and persistent antibodies against Rhesus Disease. Harrison has helped prevent thousands (millions?) of children from dying.   He has a world record for giving blood (or plasma), I'm not across the exact difference.  *Source: I wrote an article about him in high-school when trying to organise a school blood drive. This is my memory of the research I did.*
61299	0	a	Hey cool, I have the same antibody! I have saved 11 cancer patients so far!

61306	0	a	Alright, now you gotta take his place
61307	0	a	Hey random redditors reading this! Just so you know, you don’t need a rare blood mutation to help cancer patients through blood donations! Most people can donate blood platelets every week (but only up to a total of 26 times a year). They are used to help trauma patients, cancer patients and lots of other people.    Nothing is stopping you from being like these guys!  Edit - also you can totally drink right after donating platelets unlike regular whole blood donations, so feel free to schedule your appointment on weekend nights!   Edit2 - you can also donate whole blood every 8 weeks too. Donating one type of blood does not impact your ability to donate the other, usually.
61308	0	a	He isnt the only source available but he is the best. Other donors have it naturally occurring too, but just not in such levels. I believe production can be artificially induced too  https://www.donateblood.com.au/anti-d-program
61309	0	a	Rh- people can be deliberately injected with Rh+ red blood cells to induce them to produce that same anti-Rh antibody.  So we won't run out of sources.  The reason James Harrison made an anti-Rh antibody is probably because he was given Rh+ blood back when he needed so much blood when he was a kid.
61310	0	a	If memory serves, plasma is able to be donated much more often than blood, and most (or maybe all?) of his donations are actually blood plasma.

61343	0	a	Whenever I meet a person who says they've never had a dog, I just imagine the happiness when they finally have their own furry friend.  I've grown up with dogs, but as I've gotten older I've just appreciated the bond so much more.  They really are just balls of love and will never let you down.  They're awesome. 
61344	0	a	So the last time I read this, I got to trying to see things from my dog's perspective.  I had an elaborate fantasy where my dog had a talk with the cat and got to say his goodbye so that the cat wouldn't be sad or worried when he didn't come back (spoiler alert, the cat looked for him for weeks). I even imagined the conversation they had and how he told the cat to take care of his humans.   This resulted in me sobbing at work so much that I had to close my office door and leave it closed for the rest of the day so no one would realize I was crying like a baby. Mourning the death of a dog is unlike any other grief I have experienced.  I felt cold for mourning his death harder than family members.  Then I reassure myself into thinking that this little dog was part of my everyday life.  He was completely dependent on me and loved me purely and simply.  A year later and it still stings like it just happened.

Having followed him closely for over a decade, its really highlighted **how silly it is to judge people for actions they've done in the past, and label them that forever.**   The dude is 41. He became a known artist in his early 20s and he said some stupid things around that time.  I simply can't imagine being judged for the rest of my life for something's I've said over ten years ago, and having that be my defining factor. 10 years ago, I was an idiot.                 Anyway, my point is, like most of us, the guy has gone through some life changing events in his life (which he's talked about) and he's acknowledged his stupidity and has changed a lot, as far as I can see. Th guy is an **an entirely** different person from 10-15 years ago. His music is a testament of that.  All I'm saying is, it'd be pretty shitty to forever be judged for something I said 10 years ago and nothing else matters.
61383	0	a	"I don't like the whole ""have a personality"" type of thinking. I think everyone has a personality and a vast majority of, if not all people once you get to know them have a unique, enjoyable way of expressing themselves. The guy the previous poster mentioned that was incredibly boring and had zero sense of humor? That same guy could be incredibly exciting and intelligent to someone else. Personality is in a sense just as out of your control as your looks are, but being loving, being kind, etc are completely different from ""having a personality"". I think people that say certain others don't have a personality just fail to admit that there can be others that have different life journeys and different interests or ways of expressing themselves.

61398	0	a	I honestly wish to model my approach to life, and the world in general, after him.   It's incredible that someone who has suffered as much loss as he has is able to display such authenticity, kindness and empathy for others as he seems to, especially when there aren't any cameras around.
61399	0	a	This man is a god damn global treasure...  Edit:please excuse my ignorance

61401	0	a	Made me cry.
61402	0	a	Fantastic guy
61403	0	a	He’s truly a simple man, with the biggest heart. He’s very humble. Everyone is equal to him, no one is better, he treats all the same. He will give you the last piece of clothing on his back if needed. Remember that year he was sitting outside having a beer with a homeless man, and they ate and talked for awhile. Just gold this man is! We need more people like him.
61404	0	a	How is this guy so perfect?
61405	0	a	the best part for me was that it wasn't a canned answer, this wasn't some scripted hallmark moment, this answer was genuinely produced by him on the spot.  this is a man to be emulated.

61412	0	a	I am 100% sure he can lift the mjolnir.
61413	0	a	Pain. Going through lots of it, either kills you, beats you, or produces something beautiful and powerful, and present. I think he is at peace.
61414	0	a	While I really want to believe you, this *is* television. There could have been a rehearsal, a script, or post-production editing. (Still a great answer though.)
61415	0	a	I've seen the movies; he doesn't miss.
61416	0	a	I'd never before put together how close that is too when he was working on the Matrix movies. I wonder if that's why his performance was a bit muted.

61420	0	a	For people that don't know:  * Keanu's father was essentially absent his entire childhood * His close/best friend River Phoenix died from an overdose when he was 23 * In 2000, him and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Syme buried their child, who was stillborn at 8 months * This proved to be too much for the couple to handle, and they broke up weeks later  * He remained close friends with the love of his life, but Jennifer died in a car accident 18 months later. They had brunch together the day before.  * His sister battled leukemia for nearly a decade in the 90s (Reeves donated a large sum of his Matrix earnings to children's hospitals and cancer research)
61421	0	a	What I do believe is that Keanu had given this thought before and come up with the best response to a difficult question, rehearsed or not. I'll for sure be borrowing it and giving him credit.
61422	0	a	Dude Keanu's best friend River Phoenix died when they were 23.  Then 6 years later he and his girlfriend's baby was still born at 8 months. 18 months later she was killed in a car accident.  The guy knows death, and is widely reported to be one of the most genuine and down to earth people in Hollywood.
61423	0	a	I bet you a got a boyfriend
61424	0	a	And yet I think it worked perfectly for his character.
61425	0	a	Just watched The Matrix again for like the 1,000th time yesterday (it's on Netflix US) and it still holds as one of my top five all-time favorite movies. Keanu played the character so well.
61426	0	a	Not to downplay that but Stormbreaker doesn't have the worthiness qualifier like Mjolnir does, just fyi.
61427	0	a	Quoting from further down in the comments in case you missed it:  > * Keanu's father was essentially absent his entire childhood > * His close/best friend River Phoenix died from an overdose when he was 23 > * In 2000, him and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Syme buried their child, who was stillborn at 8 months > * This proved to be too much for the couple to handle, and they broke up weeks later  > * He remained close friends with the love of his life, but Jennifer died in a car accident 18 months later.

61428	0	a	Regardless if it was rehearsed or not, that was the most personal, thoughtful, nicest thing anyone could have said. The audience was genuinely shocked with how beautiful of an answer it was. It was genuine and nice to me. So I feel like that's all that matters at the end of the day.
61429	0	a	I bet he doesn't kiss ya
61430	0	a	"To me Keanu played the perfect flat ""everyman"" persona that anyone could insert themselves into. He's essentially in shock. He lived a ""life"" that was as real as a hologram, he was thrusted into a new dystopian world, he learned that humanity is essentially just a highly evolved computer program (""Whoa.""). I'm pretty sure you'd go either totally insane or become insulated and numbed."

61437	0	a	When I was a kid, I spilled hot chocolate on the bed at Grandma’s. Oh, I can still see the mess on the white sheet. I was so scared and ashamed. She wondered why I was crying. I said I thought she’d yell at me. I remember the sadness in her voice when she asked why in the world would she ever yell about a spilled drink. She helped me clean it up, and then... she made more.  Damn I miss her.

61445	0	a	This is how my parents have been my entire life, and I’m 17 almost. I’m insanely glad my parents are amazing, and I feel truly sorry for the people who have bad parents, they seem so common now, and I couldn’t imagine dealing with that, and the problems I already have.
61446	0	a	A kind memory of your grandma. I remember being at a friend’s house once when I was 8-ish and she spilled an orange soda on her bed. Her mum went berserk, ripped the sheets off, yelled and screamed. I was so shocked and scared, having never seen that behaviour from my own loving, wonderful mother. That was a big eye-opener to different families.
61447	0	a	That feeling cold dread running down your spine, your head tingling with anxiety and fear after making a little mess.. Who the fuck thinks shrieking at children for not having adult levels of hand eye coordination is good parenting??
61448	0	a	One time I sat on an egg because I thought it would hatch a chicken.  It didn’t hatch a chicken, it just made a giant ass mess all over my grandma’s carpet... when I finally told her, in tears, she laughed at what I was trying to do and we cleaned it up together. Then she taught me about how eggs you buy at a store can’t make chickens.   My mom would have beat the shit out of me.
61449	0	a	"My 1 year old just weed on the carpet the other day. My immediate reaction was to go ""OH, NAME!"" But only though instant panic about the carpet and frustration at myself for letting him run around naked for so long!  You could see his little face get immediately upset, so while cleaning it up I had to keep reassuring him that I wasn't angry at him at all. I don't want him to be in a situation like you were feeling like you might be yelled at. Those early experiences are so important for how they deal with events later in life."
61450	0	a	I was raised in a house where fists and belts and swearing were discipline. It actually takes some work to disassociate from that and realize how harmful it is. I personally thought that’s how everyone was raised until my late teens/early 20s.   When my first nieces and nephews were born, my siblings and I had a talk about all the things that happened when we were kids, and we all decided that it would be better to never raise a hand to any of them. And so far they’ve never experienced it. And they are good strong well behaved kids. Seeing that, my parents actually apologized to all of us a few years back saying that’s just how they knew how to do things. Times change, and cycles are only broken if people do the work.

And i just thought I am not allowed to eat in my bed so this would not happened.  I dunno your rules and its your daughters responsibility not mine.  We were like 8 yo
61457	0	a	Sadly a lot of people.  Sheer panic took control whenever I fucked up and how to fix it before my mother found out... no solution? Well time for crying and intense anxiety building until you want to throw up and she discovers it. *Woo.*
61458	0	a	Wow, I can’t believe your parents apologized to you. Mine are the kind to sweep it under the rug and never acknowledge it ever happened.  My oldest is 9 and I don’t even blink at some of the things he does, that I would have gotten my ass beat and grounded for. He sees my mom and thinks she’s this gentle old lady that wouldn’t harm a fly lol

61460	0	a	It definitely isn't a parent's job to be their kid's friend. But it also isn't a parent's job to be a tyrant. It's a parent's job to be a guide through life, and a positive role model. Teenagers will almost always hate their parents, but if the parent did a good job, even the teenagers will usually come around eventually.  Edit: In this thread, a ton of teens with very selective memories about how awful they were/are to their parents.

I never get angry about it, or even the least bit emotional...because it's not something which deserves such a response.   I often feel annoyed with my Mom if we're both watching the kid. I told the kiddo to chew with her mouth closed and my Mom said, ""just leave her to eat in peace!"" I was dumbfounded. I reminded my mother that if it were me, I would have already had a backhand to the teeth for chewing with my mouth open. She accused me of exaggerating."

So to get this far and then let her into my socials? No.  When she asked why, I told her exactly this. She responded by saying ""I can't believe you're that insecure that your own mother's words can effect you so much. Grow up."""
61467	0	a	Honestly parental gaslighting is the fucking worst because you were so young that you genuinely think maybe you're remembering wrong. It's worse when they'll try to make it into a cutesy story that they tell everyone and it's like no the main part of that story was the fact that you went absolutely crazy over a normal thing a kid did.

I worked with a dude who had done shit loads of meth in his life and you would never be able to tell, especially not based on his teeth which were amazingly white.   Not saying that’s the case here, I’m just pointing out that meth is fucking crazy, and sometimes meth heads are hiding in plain sight. Those “faces of meth” are usually extreme results and not every meth head looks that fucked up.

61483	0	a	I'm going to accept the downvotes that come with this and say that I think those sentiments are dangerous ones. Love certainly does not conquer all and its been my experience that blood relation can quickly lose all meaning in the face of neglect. No neglected child should feel obligated to love their parents. Forgiveness is nice and can help people heal, but OP does not have to forgive or love his dad to do right in this world. Love is earned and love is a choice. Even familial love.
61484	0	a	>I'm probably talking bullshit, but who knows?  I'm sorry but you are talking bullshit. Both of my parents were addicts up until the time they died. Both deaths directly due to alcohol and drugs.   While I love them both, it's pretty irritating to see someone lecture someone else how they should feel about their parents. You are giving over the top bullshit cliches for a very complex emotional situation.

My city in TN had a place called 'Ali-Baba's Time Out Deli' that had been there for twenty years and it started getting death threats.   Over a hundred people who would be close to borderline /r/trashy went there and told him not to worry. They were all going to set up around the block and stay there for as long as they needed to. He should just go about business as usual and know that he had nothing to worry about.  So, yeah, we got the first kind of people here, the kind making the calls, but we got way more of the second kind.

61529	0	a	I did a big USA trip a few years back and coming from Australia I found people in the south much nicer.   Places like Mass, New York, New Jersey people tend to assume your an asshole or going to ruin their day and come around to you being nice. Like you have to earn their being nice.  Down south it was like everyone assumes your a nice person and you have to earn them thinking you are an asshole by being rude. I enjoyed all the places I went, but if your a respectful person, the south is very hospitable back.  
61530	0	a	This has nothing to do with the post but does have to do with people thinking residents of the south are all racist..  I’m interested in moving there from progressive Oregon and my mom is throwing a fit that she can’t believe I’d want to live with a bunch of racist people and that I’ll hate it. While I understand part of her saying things like that is due to not wanting me to leave, it does make me hesitate and try to figure out a way to see if I can spend enough time there before buying a house there (cause for move, buying a house).  With that said, can you expand a bit more on the general lack of racism if at all possible? I’ve been led to believe that segregation is still illegal but that poc and whites don’t really socialize, poc are looked down on by whites, that sort of thing. I’m white and not racist, if that helps.   Edit: in between posting this comment and just now getting all these replies that I haven’t even begun to read yet, I received some tough life talk and really needed a smile on my face.

He is legitimately, in every way, one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life.  This is reminding me that I should call him and just say hello.

61543	0	a	I’m originally from New York and now living in small-town Alabama, and I can genuinely say Ive witnessed LESS racism down here than I ever did up there. It just goes against the modern southern mentality to be rude to another person deliberately - they’re a welcoming people! When a Spanish-speaking woman came into our clinic, the nurses and desk staff worked so hard to find somebody who could communicate with her. They sat her in the lobby and used Google translate to tell her “don’t worry sweetie, we’ll find someone!” and called in an off-duty staff member to come translate. Up North, they treat immigrants with disdain. I was so impressed!   I will say, though, that sexism is alive and well down here. You learn to bear it, but if you’re a woman expect to be asked a million times when you’re going to have babies and settle down. Social life in small town South also revolves almost entirely around church-sponsored events (Christian, of course) and if you’re not religious, you’ll find it a little harder to make friends.   Good luck with your move! 
61544	0	a	I’ve lived in the south almost all my life and it’s definitely not fair to say that there is a lack of racism, but it’s far more understated that stereotypes would have you believe. Also, in public, politeness is highly valued in the south, whether it’s genuine or superficial. This means a lot of people keep their racist opinions to themselves until they are around people they know well.

I hope that it can provide some comfort for you, too.   >Do not stand at my grave and weep >I am not there; I do not sleep. >I am a thousand winds that blow, >I am the diamond glints on snow, >I am the sun on ripened grain, >I am the gentle autumn rain. >When you awaken in the morning's hush >I am the swift uplifting rush >Of quiet birds in circled flight. >I am the soft stars that shine at night. >Do not stand at my grave and cry, >I am not there; I did not die.  -Mary Elizabeth Frye

I fucked around in college, and wasted a lot of time, but I learned a lot (even if my grades didn't reflect it), and while I didn't take the path to climb the same corporate ladder that my friends did, I've got a family, a house, a good job, I'm back in school, and this time, my GPA is 3.5.

He got the diploma and all the time he saved avoiding things he didn’t care about let him spend enough time in the lab to start a communications company right after graduating.

Just remember that the only person who you'll have to spend your entire life with is yourself, so make sure  you like yourself before worrying about anyone else's plans for you.  Internships are important, but worry less about which internship you get, and more about making the best out of whichever one you get. Grades are also important, and if you're dead set on medical school, or getting some big corporate job in a shiny office building downtown, they matter, but there are a lot of people in the world who aren't as smart, or as hardworking as you are, and they've done just fine.

There was also this incident at Walter Reed:  > In her book “And The Good News Is,” Dana Perino, who was Bush’s press secretary, recounted a 2005 visit to Walter Reed. It was marked by a tense moment with the mother of a gravely wounded service member. The mother wanted to know why her child, and not Bush’s, was clinging to life, Perino wrote. The president tried unsuccessfully to comfort her. So rather than continue to speak, he simply listened, absorbing her anger and grief. Departing the hospital aboard Marine One, Bush allowed a single tear to roll down his cheek, Perino noted in her book. “That mama sure was mad at me,” the president said. “And I don’t blame her a bit.”  Also, since leaving office he's worked on [advocacy for the wounded,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/10/21/were-not-just-random-people-how-george-w-bush-connected-with-those-he-sent-to-war/?utm_term=.af570b9a0a20) participated in [children's charities,](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/21/george-w-bush-dressed-as-santa-hands-out-toys-at-c/) and worked to establish the [Clinton Bush Haiti Fund](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/01/16/clinton-bush-haiti-fund) among many other things.  Had it not been for 9/11 he likely would have had one of the more boring presidencies and in all likelihood wouldn't have been reelected. He really was a decent dude who got stuck with a raw deal and royally fucked it up after getting terrible advice.

61710	0	a	You realize that Congress declared war, not the President, and it was at the time nearly unanimous? There was a vote to take military action and Congress approved it. If the President made the decision without Congress the process would’ve been much more similar to Vietnam, and would have been illegal for us to still be in the Middle East at this point.

His voice quivering, he said, ""Ignorance is bliss, and, man, do I wish I had some.""  Probably the most idenfiable book I've read on this is Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament. I find it remarkable that even 3,500 years ago, writers were saying things like, ""For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.""   The struggle is as old as time."

61726	0	a	That's an easy fallacy to make. Just because someone is bad, doesn't mean they put in less effort. In my experience, the people who are in the bottom 10 put in more effort than some people who are average or even good.    TL;DR There is not really a strong correlation between low effort and bad grades.  Edit: Added strong because sometimes but far from always it is correlated.

Do you want to take a look at the stars through the most badass telescopes? This is the internet man, we can make almost anything happen.  Edit: hey guys, OP says he doesnt want us to do anything at all towards him, he'd rather spend time with his family. So lets respect his wishes. As much as I'd like OP to at least name his cancer or a charity he'd like us to donate to, this was not his intention. I suppose just live a good life and stay motivated.
61746	0	a	Some times is coincidence, sometimes not. I just read this while waiting to talk with the coordinator of my Masters. I'm doing part of my dream, I'm doing a masters in 3 countries about mathematics and on the very first semester I manage to fail 2 of 5 subjects while I'm allowed only to fail one. I'm feeling awful about throwing one life time opportunity away due laziness. I know that I'm capable but I simple didn't studied. I'm destroyed by inside. But after reading your text I realised that there are worst things that can happen to me. And that even if that happen, I need to find my way to pursue my happiness and do something amazing from my life. I would like you to know that you really did something important in my life. You, a complete stranger. We never met, we never talked, we never see each other. But you changed my life. At least in this moment or maybe all my future. Thank you. I will do my best to honor your words. I love you my friend. And I will miss you.

My heart goes out to you and your family. And for the record, your tie is absolutely perfect.  I wanted to share something with you and others here as well:  [""You want a physicist to speak at your funeral."" - by Aaron Freeman](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4675953) You may listen to him read aloud his essay at that link and here is a transcript:  > AARON FREEMAN:  >You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the [conservation of energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy), so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.  >And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.  >And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.  >And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly.   >Amen. "

61755	0	a	I'm a cancer patient too. I was diagnosed with leukaemia 3 years ago and told I had a 10-20% chance of surviving. I relapsed after my first bone marrow transplant, and prior to receiving my second, my chances of a cure were nearly 0. But I'm still here - 2 years after my second today. Recently, I've lost vision in my left eye. Permanently. I'm still not sure what the cause is... and I recorded this when I found out it was gone forever.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEAQ6HjuF5s One thing I've always urged, in my blogs, in my talks, whether it be directed at medical students, doctors, or just regular people is exactly what this unfortunate man is saying.... Don't wait for something bad to happen to change yourself and the world around you for the better.   But I also want you all to know that no matter who you are, no matter what challenges you face, or goals you wanna achieve, that you CAN do what you really want to.  It may not happen straight away, it will take time and effort to get there, but if you take a step back, look at what's happened objectively and just ask why of all your obstacles, over and over again, you give yourself the best chance of succeeding.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgo8Q0etQrg  It's what I did to stay as happy and healthy as possible through my journey with cancer. It's what I'm doing to become the best doctor I can be, while also supporting others, starting up a new platform for charities to secure funds, and writing a book on how to make pharmaceuticals more efficient; so patients like us, all around the world, in 20 years from now never have to suffer as much as we do now.

61759	0	a	Just shed a few tears at work, this is by far the best post I have read on here and I have saved it. For the past few months I have been struggling to motivate myself but after reading this I am motivated again to do the things I want. Your first bullet point hit home as I fucking detest my job...I will now enroll in a college course to become a PT, something I have always wanted to do but didn't because of other people opinion which is your second point, I have found my sport that makes me happy and your final point about family is perfect, my mum and dad are fucking mega stars and I don't tell them enough and my GF is the single greatest thing in my life, so much so on our 10 year anniversary(13th March) I will ask her to marry me! I'm not letting her go.  You are a fucking great human being and you have put everything into perspective for me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  p.s. your tie fucking rocks :) 
61760	0	a	None of us are facing death any less square in the eyes than you, it's just that for a lot of us, it's a little further away. Life is a straight line segment, and nothing any of us can do can change or reverse that. Your advice is sound, and I hope everyone can see that you don't need a terminal diagnosis to accept that advice with complete passion. Thank you so much for this post. It served me as an excellent reminder.

Obviously its a nice sentiment to suggest him meeting Elon Musk, and it would be unbelievable if that happned- but it's not the point he's trying to convey at all.

I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful.""   To be clear I'm not undermining this idea in any way, I'm all for it. I just think this isn't us seeing the bigger picture he was trying to portray. It is devastating that he has cancer, but his message is a powerful and exciting one. Great post man:) "

61774	0	a	I'd just like to wish you some luck on your master's, if you decide to continue.  I graduated with mine about a year ago, but let me tell you, there were plenty of times I didn't think I had it in me.  My first thesis, due in part to some issues with my first adviser, was rejected.  I fell into a bottomless pit and it took me a really long time to crawl out.  I thought about just giving up.  I didn't and went on to pen something that I could at least graduate with and even received a pretty decent mark.  If it's what you want, I'm sure you can push through and accomplish.  I've moved on to a new struggle, finding a job, but I know if I could make it through my thesis, I can find some way to put it to good use.  I'm sure you can accomplish whatever you want, also.  Best of luck.

Although I think Elon Musk is one of the men who has the capacity to change the world, I don't want this to be about me. Knowing that I have touched your lives is enough. Truthfully, I would like to spend what time I have left quietly with my loved ones. That's all that matters. But again, thank you all from the bottom of my heart!   P.S. To the guys who said they'd quit smoking, you have my full support! I'd be grateful to you if you really quit.

61785	0	a	I know what he is encouraging us to do, and he's done it - he's made a lot of people's day and motivated a lot of people. He's only got a little time left in the world though, and honestly, I'd love nothing more than to see him do what so few others have been able to before he goes, whether it be talk with one of the greats, see some of the worlds best sights, experience that one experience he's always wanted to.  It isn't game over just yet.

Threw an entire pack out and never touched them again."
61788	0	a	My doctor told me that if I don't quit, I will lose my leg (broke it and severed the aortal).    It amazes me to think that I knew smoking would cause cancer (both grandfathers died of it from smoking),  but that seemed so far fetched.

61795	0	a	Opiate withdrawal is a bitch, but life is so much better clean. There is so much more that the world has to offer than drugs. I know how hard it can be, I have gone through this a few times. You will have some bad days (and that is okay, we all do), but you also have so many amazing days to come. Your life will be richer than you could have ever dreamed. I can tell you this honestly: life is better without opiates.   When I'm having a hard time, I try to remember how much withdrawal sucks, and that it always comes if I am using. Fuck being a slave to opiates, or anything at all. Fuck having drugs be the only thing that matters in your life. You deserve more than that, you deserve better. Good luck, I am rooting for you :). Kick addiction in it's stupid shitty fucking ass!!

What a hero should be.   His contribution to our culture cannot he overstated. And will undoubtedly outlive us all. Only time will tell just how much impact they have made.

61816	0	a	"Posted this in the other thread, but I think it's relevant here too.      ---      Comic books helped me learn to read well enough to get me out of special ed.    Back when I was in elementary school I was years behind my class in reading, which is actually really impressive for a 1st grader when you take the time to think about it. Worse still was the fact that my school, having been built 40 years earlier, was at full capacity long before special ed 'classrooms' could be assigned, so I and my six fellow special students (who ranged in specialness from ""I have difficulty with verbs"" to ""I have difficulty getting the paste stick out of my nose"") took our classes in a free broom closet. Our teacher, Mrs. Lewis, did the best that she could with us, but since her students were so diverse she really couldn't tend to all of us the way that we needed.  Second and third grade came and went with little improvement in me, it was becoming clear to everybody that I'd peaked at six years old, I was a one star boy, relegated forever to remedial reading.  Like any boy of the 90's though, there were two things that I loved: Video games and the X-Men animated TV show. (Saturday morning was for ballers, back then.) You may or may not remember, but comic books and everything related to them were a big flippin' deal there for a while, new cartoons coming out all the time, games, trading cards, anything to turn a property into a profit, and we were happy to give over our parents' money for it.  Then came the two part animated special X-Men: Days of Future Past, and it was awesome. In fact it was so awesome that I actually bought a book (gasp!) at the next Scholastic book fair (It was the 'novelization' of the episode) and I loved it! Who knew reading could be so much fun? Nobody had to shoot their dog!  Of course comic book fans know that ""Days of Future Past"" was originally a story arc from the comics, so after I'd plowed through the thirty pages of novel in an afternoon (a big deal for me at the time) I went out and bought the comic books, which were even better! I'd read and reread the graphic novels over and over again. When presented with a word I didn't know (which were quite a lot, at first) I'd reach for the dictionary and figure it out. These were everything I needed: Compelling bite-sized stories to entertain the mind, beautiful artwork for the eyes, and writing that neither spoke down to its audience nor spoke over it. Comic books didn't intimidate the way a novel did (and if I'm being honest still does to this day), they weren't something that anybody said to me ""Don't bother reading that, Max, you won't get it."" X-Men opened a door, they made words fascinating where before they had been frustrating, they were everything I didn't know I needed. I thought I was in love with X-Men, but then I discovered Spider-Man: A hero with an unerring moral compass and chronic depression. He was just like me but with super powers and an unerring moral compass! Talk about exciting! Optic blasts and adamantium claws were awesome but difficult to relate to, but a 30-something photographer struggling to reconcile his heroic and humanistic nature was, like, way more awesome than claws! (As an adult I realized that adamantium claws are both cooler and more useful than chronic clinical depression, but we all learn as we get older.) Both Spider-Man and Peter Parker were characters that I could care about, relate to, and most importantly, invest my time and attention into.  Over the next decade or so I read comics by the pound, old stuff, new stuff, boring stuff, exciting stuff, smart stuff, stupid stuff, whatever I could get my eyes on, and right in step with that reading was an improvement in my grades. I'd started school years behind my classmates, but by middle school I'd been moved up to ""Merit"" (read: grade level) classes, then in high school I moved up again to Honors and AP. Comic books really opened the world up for me, they were a most necessary stepping stone without which I don't think I'd ever have cleared the ledge. Some of us are neither Anakin nor Obi Wan, we need middle ground to get where we're going; comic books were my middle ground.  Without Stan Lee and Spider-Man I wouldn't be the man I am today, that's no exaggeration.   In the context of get motivated if make this point: Never underestimate the significance of your contribution. Stan Lee thought he was an entertainer, but for me he was a teacher, a counselor, and a philosopher. A poem can change a life, a smile can save one, and only the person saved will know it. "

61827	0	a	While I feel you, I think one of the big things about depression that gets overlooked is a lot of people *can't* get pleasure out of those things anymore. A lot of people think about depression as being sad, and for many that is part of the equation. But for a great many, it's not feeling sad. It's feeling nothing.  When I'm in my bad place, I try to focus on good things, things I think are fun normally. The kicker is, they're not fun anymore. Like, the motivation to put any effort toward making myself happy is completely sapped. Every positive bit of encouragement I receive comes off as trying to prove how I *should* be happy by this, but I don't feel anything. Then later, when I come out of my funk, I can feel happy again, but it's accompanied by intense guilt for not having been able to be happy about it then.  I don't mean to sound like a negative Nancy, especially in a thread about pulling yourself out of dark places, but I just think there's a fundamental misunderstanding for many about what depression is and why thinking about the good things usually doesn't actually help in a good number of cases. It's not just being sad. It's being unable to control how you feel, and sometimes it's not feeling anything at all.  Edit: Omg thank you so much to all of you who replied to ask questions or share your stories/experiences or offer your advice/techniques. I'm glad beyond words that I could vocalize this experience for so many of you, because it's something that's haunted me for so long, and reading this conversation has made me *feel something*! For that I'm more grateful than I could say.

Not trying to sound like a cynic, just a bummer to see people be so good at something when my hundreds of hours of practice didn’t achieve much and now I’ve lost that passion.

61872	0	a	"the trick is to endure the pain and misery and suffering of failure at that point.  when you've reached a hump, you have to work to get over it tirelessly, sometimes locking yourself in a basement and not eating for days solely obsessed with your goal.  anyone can get over these humps, the question is time, desire, passion, drive...  if you say 'I'm not good at this' you'll give up playing an instrument, doing art, programming or any other hobby within a year or so -- as it becomes obvious your nowhere near at the level to actually compete...  but this is the thing -- you have to do it for the love of it. whatever it is. you have to want to get better JUST so you can do it. not so you can prove anything.  it has to be like beating a boss in a hard game like dark souls-- just 1000x more crushing.  because often times, the things you must learn to practice are the boring things far before you can have 'fun' (and eventually, fun becomes work when you CAN get there)  things like extreme small fine motor control, timing, logic, manipulation of math or data structures intuitively.  it becomes grind work. of sitting at a piano, listening to notes for 18 hours saying ""this is A"" ""this is b"", ""this is do, this is di"", and progressing to chords, etc.  it becomes hours of playing a guitar when you know you suck - redoing every measure over and over again until you nail it perfect 100% run no mistakes with a recording, analyzing every pick stroke, every attack, every single motion made.  the key is to say ""I suck, but EVERYONE sucked at this point"" and suck it up yourself and keep going.  I think being able, and willing to do that is what separates truly great people, and people who will succeed from those who dont.  some are able, but not willing and forced and find no passion in things -- no ingenuity, just cold, complacent interpretations of the work of others  not everyone has advantages early in life though, so its not always fair.  but if you really want to get at least to an intermediate level of most things -- all you have to do is not give up when that hump comes, give it your all without a break 18 hours a day until you win.   unfortunately the walls are just going to keep growing higher as you gain more skill. so your ability to continuously adapt decides if you will actually 'make it' in that area."

With great pomp and ceremony, he left his home and went to the temple. He met with the head monk, who agreed to let him study kung fu at the temple. The rich man shaved his head and donned the robes and was led to a room containing a well and a barrel of water. The monk told him to slap the surface of the water with his palm until no water remained in the barrel. The rich man didn't understand, but did as he was told. He slapped the water with his palm and a little water splashed onto the floor. He repeated the slapping for what seemed like hours until no water remained. He found the monk and told him he had finished. The monk instructed him to fill the barrel again and repeat the task. This scene repeated for days. Eventually, the rich son stopped going to the monk and just refilled the barrel without being told. He grew angry. He suspected he was the butt of a cruel joke, and that the monks would never teach him kung fu but he knew that if he returned to his family having only slapped water he would be a laughingstock. Eventually, the seasons changed and the rich son returned home for the holiday feast. His family was so proud of him for studying kung fu, even though he was secretly ashamed that he had not received even one day's instruction. ""What kung fu did you learn? What did they teach you?"" his family asked, eagerly. ""They didn't teach me anything,"" he mumbled. ""Oh, you are so modest, tell us what they taught you!"" they urged. The man grew enraged. ""They didn't teach me anything!"" he shouted, as he slammed his palm on the table, breaking it in half. "

I got a VR headset (Vive) back in February with my tax return because I was really hyped to try out VR games like Gorn, Pavlov, Onward, and H3VR. This last month, though, I've managed to regulate my diet once again and I've been doing my best to put in 30 minutes to an hour of Expert Beat Saber with No Fail mode on to keep moving. It really is more of a cardio workout than you'd expect, same deal with Gorn. I found what works for me by fusing my favorite hobby with exercise, and I've lost 8 pounds since the end of June, with no plan to stop soon. 
61915	0	a	Yep. If I do my workout, I get to eat the sluttiest cheeseburger ever.   It's worth it. 
61916	0	a	Switch to anywhere but McDonald's. I'm not even talking about the health reasons, be unhealthy all you like. I just strongly dislike the MCD as a restaurant. Feel the same way about Walmart. Also, why are fkn McDonald's and Walmart always right next to one another? Conspiracy or not, it makes it easier to avoid both of them. There. I'm done now.   Edited for clarity.

61923	0	a	"I volunteered at one of the medical aid tents roughly halfway through the course and followed their progress over the radio net.   **The max time limit should have been enforced and they should have been swept by the bus (seen behind them) halfway through the race.** Nearly every med aid tent had to check on them. They hobbled past us looking very tired and we went to check. They held up the sweep bus, who carried all the *medical drop-outs* behind them. To be clear, all those people who left the race because of medical reasons were being stifled from follow-up care by these two.   They were *very* far back beyond all others. When we thought we were done for the day (started out there setting up/orienting at at 5:30am), we waited around an extra 40 minutes or so but checked on them and cheered them on as they passed.   Problem is...most of the roads were shut down in Pittsburgh well after they were done (which was like halfway into the afternooon). You could simply not get home if you lived even remotely close to any part of the marathon course or required roads close to it.   Downvotes incoming, but this is not ""perseverance,"" this is medical stupidity.  Edit 1: Thank you for my first silver ever, kind stranger!  Edit 2: Thank you for my *second* silver, kind stranger! And thank you everyone for having an open and honest conversation about this.  I'm all for pushing yourself, but when your stubborn sense of accomplishment becomes more important than not only your health but the well-being of others, it becomes a problem for everyone."

61931	0	a	That said Pittsburgh also had a time limit so if these people are being acknowledged as the last they're probably the last ones going at a good enough pace to finish before that time

61933	0	a	Except for those who already finished the marathon and then sat down on a couch.
61934	0	a	Running is definitely not easier.  There's a reason it burns more calories.
61935	0	a	That may have been because you wore out your body over most of the race and then switching to a walk broke your rhythm long enough for the endorphins to thin out and the fatigue to fully set in. I’ve hiked longer than a marathon distance in one go myself, but based on how the occasional 2-3 mile runs I go on feel I definitely can’t run a full marathon as I am.

61954	0	a	If I recall correctly, the episode this scene features in is where Homer explains to Bart and Lisa why they don’t have baby pictures of Maggie. As it turns out, before Maggie was born, Homer worked at the power plant (which he hated) but really wanted to quit and pursue his dream of working for the bowling alley. He eventually does quit but later finds out Marge is pregnant with Maggie. Due to financial problems, Homer has to let his bowling dream go and beg for his job back at the power plant to make ends meet (Mr Burns puts the plaque there to remind him that that’s his life now). When Lisa and Bart ask what the story has to do with the lack of photos of Maggie, Homer just says that the photos are where he needs them most, which turns out to be his workstation. So whilst he does have two other kids, Maggie is the thing that keeps him going when he goes to the place he hates most.

The majority of the suites aren’t even other people’s homes. Many of them are owned by management groups. People have been evicted from rentals under the guise of the homeowners needing it back, only to see it reposted on AirBnB illegally.   Apartments are being exposed to more thefts now that Airbnb owners are just mass cloning keys and fobs, and handing them out like candy.  And the vast majority of them probably aren’t even reporting their incomes.

I said fuck it thinking I had nothing to lose, and decided to talk to her.  We've been together now for 9 years, married for three, and have a baby girl on the way.  It always gives me a stomach ache thinking what if I didn't have the balls to talk to her that one day. I don't know where I'd be today without her.
62020	0	a	Ok what if she says no, the depression is crippling, you drink to forget about her. But you're too drunk you've lost your phone and all reason has left you, just like her. Sitting at the bar you're forced to leave. You stumble to your car in drunken stupor. You fumble with the keys, she liked keys. She probably had a car too but it's too late now you can't change her mind. You finally creak open the car door. Your phone was in it the entire time. You pick it up it's a photo of her. The one that'll never be. In a drunken rage you through it. Anger overcomes you, you get into the car crank the engine and peel out of the parking lot. You swerve across the road narrowly missing trash cans and street lights. Until bam you hit another car. You crawl out of the wreckage to see if the other driver's ok. Feelings of drunken regret wash over you. You get closer. It's her, she was the other driver. You scream in horror. What have i done you shout. Then you get closer try to pull her out and and, her mask falls off. It was john cena.

My friend hooked me up with her and I went to New York by train to meet her. I hung out with her, we went to a park, I paid for lunch for the both of us, she showed me around her college campus, we did all of that while walking in 90+ degree weather. We had a nice time. But then right before we departed and I went home, she told me she couldn't see me anymore and she doesn't want to date me. It took everything it had in me to not cry on the train.  There's nothing I want more than to feel loved by someone, and in return, make someone feel like they're loved. I hate being alone. I hate being single. I'm not really an attractive guy, and I don't even think I'll get a girl anytime soon. But I think one day, I'll get someone. One day. I don't know when. I don't know how. And I don't know why they would choose me. But I'm sure that one day, hopefully, I'll finally land the right person for me.

62073	0	a	I spent ~7 years as an Apple Solutions Consultant, aka the full-time Apple corporate employee stationed inside the Mac area at CompUSA (and later Best Buy). It was a largely forgotten role that faded out as the Apple Stores blew up, but for the first few years I loved it. I had all the perks of being an Apple employee (prestige, experience, discounts, trips to HQ, etc.), while also being largely autonomous in how I ran my business. I made some lifelong friends, learned a TON about retail operations and general business practices, and I miss it quite often. I make more money and have way more stability in my current non-Apple office job, but there was a thrill that came with the ASC role that was hard to explain.

I was working as a student in a mall in belgium and they showed me the price apple was selling iphones to them : to sell at msrp they made less than 1€ by iPhone ( around 700€) and they said it was more of a calling product because usually people buy a case alongside the phone. Moreover, they couldn't choose when and what to be delivered by apple, apple won't sell iPhone if you don't agree. So sometimes they were out of iPhone for 5 month, sometimes they received a shitload of old iPhone they had trouble selling. The management were hesitating about completely selling them.

Just make sure if you don't process dairy that well, that you also eat a lot of yogurt. That zing taste in yogurt is lactase, which helps break down lactic acid before it ferments into sugars in your gut and causes all that pain and acid shits. It helps, a lot. I go through a gallon of icecream every 4 days. But I've gotten to see the far side of 180 twice despite my autoimmune disease and my digestive tract damage. 
62143	0	a	> I understand like 1.5-2% or some shit  Even that is going to be fatal. Guys like Andreas Munzer dont make it to 40 for a reason and theyre usually hovering around 3-4% for just a few years before they die.

62155	0	a	Cystic fibrosis affects the lungs, and causes a lot of systemic body issues. If this kid has c.f. and looks like that he must be incredibly driven. The life expectancy is pretty low, but most folks make the best of it. Edit for spelling
62156	0	a	I believe they’re talking about Cystic Fibrosis
62157	0	a	One of symptoms of CF is pancreas dysfunction, which can lead to malabsorption. Being underweight due to that can actually make it a lot harder for them to breathe as well as giving them less of a reserve in times of illness (which happen more often) so CF experts often recommend very high calorie diets to try to maintain the weight.   Like, a cystic fibrosis patient might be recommended to eat double what someone else of their gender/height is recommended. Otherwise, if they're underweight, it has been shown to reduce what lung function they do have.  Looking at the guy in the OP, if he's not underweight he's still not in the high normal/low overweight range where he should really try to be.  TLDR: Brother is still probably too skinny and really should probably eat more.
62158	0	a	Since it wasn't mentioned, the monkey is shown jogging ~~with a partner in the opening credits for the first season~~ alone in many of the establishing shots for BoJack's house.

Then, in this episode, which is a season finale, Bojack starts to jog I was like, ""oh will he meet Monkey Friend??"" And then not only does Monkey Friend turn up, but he drops THIS giant truth bomb on us? Coming at a particularly difficult time in my life as well, this scene hit me very hard. "

62189	0	a	Season 3, Episode 3. Great episode for quotes. Here’s another from the same episode:  “I don’t know what to tell you. I’m happy for the first time in my life and I’m not gonna feel bad about it. It takes a long time to realize how truly miserable you are and even longer to see it doesn’t have to be that way. Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy”
62190	0	a	It’s not stupid. This entire show is largely about dealing with depression and just the ugly side of life in general. The escapist environment with all the anthropomorphic animals and off-the-wall humor is meant to contrast with the rest of the show’s cynical and depressingly dark material.
62191	0	a	> Sometimes snippets of certain sad shows have uplifting moments.  Ie life
62192	0	a	"It's a show I struggle with personally. I love it, I really do, but as the seasons pass I find my love for it fading.   I used to suffer from depression. Now I manage it, and I'm in a very good place. I can honestly say, I'm happy, but more than that I'm joyful.  Bojack does absolutely nothing to bring joy into his own life. And he does EVERYTHING wrong that someone with depression can do wrong.  Then I come on Reddit and see how people, tons of people, make the claim that you can't just ""get over"" depression. They act like it's hopeless and there's nothing you can do. Shows like bojack show a hero who feels that way, and I think in those people's minds he just further reinforces that very wrong concept that you can't do anything to deal with depression besides hope medication works.  As I see more and more people around me fall into a cycle of depression, laziness, and apathy, each one feeding each other like some twisted Cerberus, it makes me cynical of shows like bojack. Shows that just perpetuate the idea that when you fall into that cycle you can't get out."

Shame, as I loved Futurama and Firefly and other ensemble ""tackle the theme of the week and learn a lesson"" shows but I just never got a start on watching Trek until a few weeks ago."

62213	0	a	I would say Next Generation is definitely worth watching. It is a great show and if you like quotes in this thread, that’s a majority of what the show is. If you need an episode to see if it’s for you, one of my favorites is “Measure of A Man” from I think the second season. You don’t need a lot of background info, and it’s not too far in that you lose much. 
62214	0	a	If you go back to watch TNG don't be thrown off by the camera quality in the first season. You can tell that they're a bit under funded and still trying to find their rhythm but you shouldn't skip it by any means.  Star Trek was a very political show and still holds up, surprisingly a lot of their topics are even more applicable than some previous years.   Some of the effects will look a bit dated as well but it was never a big space action show like the newer movies are so its not as in your face. 
62215	0	a	Skipping DS9?  That's a shame.  Either way, check out The Orville... TNG feel, just with parody (mostly for copyright reasons it seems)

62220	0	a	Yes! Love this. Sometimes I feel awkward being a first time college student in my 30’s. Intending on going on to law school. Assuming all goes as planned, I’ll be 39 when I get my degree. Whenever I have those moments of insecurity about my age I just remind myself I’m going to be 39 regardless so I may as well enjoy the age AND have the degree.   Edit: so great to read everyone’s personal stories that are so similar to mine! Thanks for the conversation and motivation today. You’ve all made my day!

However finally I feel like it is ok. Yes I started later and am did a study that is not difficult learning wise for me.   But I managed to get a grip on my anxiety disorder. I managed to actually attend school and I have grown so much since the days I was locked up in my student dorm to scared to come out. To scared to get food incase anything might happen.  I got a job where I am doing good. It may take longer, but I have learned so much more.   Thank you for this post it is spot on.   Edit: thank you all for the kind respondses!

I've been debating going back to uni, I know I can get in and I know what I want to do. But I'm just so scared of failing. What happens if I spend 4-6 years at uni, being a broke uni student, taking on a large debt; just to fail/not get a job in my field?  So unsure of what to do.

62256	0	a	I 💓 love your comment. And I love Sophie.   My family is from Poland. Only my greatgrandfather, gradnfather, and grandfather's sister survived. Fled to Argentina after my great grandfather received a tip of the impending trouble. Great grandma and rest of the fam didnt beleive him. They were sent to aushwitz and never heard from again. Before the nazis came, he took his two kids and fled Poland. We've never been back. They settled in Buenos Aires only to find out that it was nazi occupied and they hated jews there also. So he changed our last name from a very jewish one to a german sounding one. I still have the fake German last name. And all our family history has been pretty much erased other than the story that is passed down from my grandpa. My grandpa is 90 now and the nicest man i ever met. He does not like to talk about losing his mom and the rest of his family. Ive tried but he seemed to not want to discuss anything. The younger generations are the ones to pass the story along. He just smiles and loves food.   Anyway, Thank God for Sophie. And all like Sophie who couldve stayed out of it and comfortably lived their lives, instead they sacrificed their own peace and lives to fight for thr millions of people who did nothing wrong yet were seperated from their families, robbed of their lives, starved, tortured, murdered, and had no voice. She was one of many who fought for us. I will never lose hope in humans knowing there are always Sophies around.

EDIT: I'm getting a lot of replies to this, so before I get any more straw-man comments to the effect of ""you're saying nobody should do the right thing if it won't change the ultimate outcome,"" let me direct you to two replies I made that spell out how I *actually* feel about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/91w483/image_sophie_scholls_last_words/e31ktfh/ https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/91w483/image_sophie_scholls_last_words/e31kw2i/ Please give those comments a read before you try to tell me what I think and why I'm wrong for thinking it, when I don't actually think that. The least you can do is give me the courtesy of listening to my actual stance before you argue with it. There is a big difference between ""it didn't matter"" (what I'm saying) and ""it shouldn't have been done"" (what I'm very much NOT saying but a lot of people seem to think I am)."

62263	0	a	"Did it matter? Certainly she felt it did. [Henning von Tresckow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_von_Tresckow), who was the principal leader of resistance against Hitler in the German armed forces, said something similar about *needing* to resist regardless of ultimate success:  ""The assassination must be attempted at all costs. Even if it should not succeed, an attempt to seize power in Berlin must be made. What matters now is no longer the practical purpose of the coup, but to prove to the world and for the records of history that the men of the resistance dared to take the decisive step. Compared to this objective, nothing else is of consequence. It is almost certain that we will fail. But how will future history judge the German people if not even a handful of men had the courage to put an end to that criminal?""  I think that just considering people 70 years later can look to her as an inspiration showed that her actions did matter"
62264	0	a	Even if she didn't have an impact then, her words mean something to us now.
62265	0	a	You are missing the whole point. It does not matter if her defiance aroused either awareness or defiance in others; she had no control over that. She did what was right. All she could do was hope. What is more noble? Sacrificing your life knowing it will stir positive change or not knowing? *crying* Not knowing—by God—is the bravest state under which anyone could take action.
62266	0	a	That quote is extraordinary. Von Tresckow persisted in the face of almost certain failure and death, personally accepting the burden of representing the good in Germans, and in humanity, to all future generations.  I'd like to think that I could do the right thing in a similar situation. But reading about von Tresckow's life story and his resistance against Hitler has convinced me that I very likely would or could not. The actions of heroes like him are so incredibly far removed from all the challenges I've faced in my life.  Whenever I read about the noble sacrifices of people like von Tresckow, I appreciate even more that there's very little chance that I could ever convince myself to make that kind of sacrifice, let alone even find myself in a position where I have to choose. The best I can do is respect and remember the sacrifices of others, and to feel fortunate and a bit guilty for being randomly assigned an easier life than most.

62305	0	a	Don't worry if you think you are no good.  Most of my own art is pretty lame.  But nowadays when I make something, I display it on some random part of my property so I can see it when I walk around my place.    Because I stopped trying to do art for others, and instead just do it for me.  If someone visits me and  genuinely likes something, I give it to them if they want it.  That way even though I am not talented or creative enough to make a living at art, at least the people who like it get to see it, and I get to know it's being appreciated.

62320	0	a	"I think a lot of the time they are making a smart decision. The standard definitions of success and failure aren't going to work for everyone. I'd argue that they don't work for the majority of people. It's incredibly common for people to spend their lives fighting an uphill battle and on reaching the very top to realize that it's never brought them any real happiness.   Not saying it's always the case with the people you're describing. But often times intelligence is being able to look at what other people say is going to be satisfying to you and realizing that it's their dream instead of your own. It's especially true when what's being held out is essentially martyrdom. ""Done nothing with their lives"" is often shorthand for ""Lived life for themselves rather than for me and the rest of society""  One of the harder puzzles in early life is just figuring out what path is going to actually provide a happy and satisfying life. If the smartest person in the room isn't making the same choice as everyone else it probably shouldn't be assumed that they're being dumb about it. Rather, that there's a chance that they're looking at it in a different way than the average person. "

It is not a character flaw. It is simply the state of my body. "
62324	0	a	"100%, thank you for saying this. As disabled people, we need our limitations acknowledged and accepted, not belittled or disbelieved, even if the intention is good. When someone tells me not to let my ""disability"" (or as I like to call it, my disability) hold me back, they're saying it like I have a choice in the matter, implicitly blaming me for my own condition. That kind of attitude spills over into people not making accommodation for me (because if I just tried harder I could overcome it). Sometimes there are things that I am simply not able to do.  Motivation and positive thinking won't make my muscles and nerves start magically working again (though you do find the occasional person who genuinely believes that they will), so this kind of motivational post, while well-intentioned, can imply some really shitty things about those disabled people who *can't* achieve everything they wanted or hoped."

I played Daggerfall when Bethesda released that for free on their website a few years back and was surprised to see climbing skills, language skills, streetsmarts, tons of stuff.  The first Elder Scrolls game I played was Morrowind, which I feel was a pretty good balance. There were a lot of interesting spells and skill (spears, throwing stars, levitation, unlock and teleportation spells, waterwalking, burden and feather) without getting crazy granular like Daggerfall did, although I think climbing and medical would have been nice to leave in.  Oblivion just trashed the entire weapon system with blade and blunt, then Skyrim even removed that distinction. ""Why yes, I hold this mace in one hand, just like a dagger, that's totally the same skill set!""  Also, even though there's a literal college of mages, nobody remembers how to craft spells? "

Sidney hated the stigmatization of special education and began to lose interest in school all together.  Nevertheless, he graduated from Essex High School in 2001, but with a 1.8 GPA. With limited options regarding four-year colleges, he enrolled in J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College in Richmond, Virginia, where he did so well that he was able to transfer to a four-year university the following year. Sidney received a bachelor’s degree in human services in 2006. He went on earn his Master of Social Work at Virginia Commonwealth University.  He  authored the series *Nelson Beats The Odds* to share his experience and inspire others in similar situations.

62377	0	a	Sometimes kids with ADHD are tagged as 504 and some are tagged to special ed. The reason they're tagged special ed is because they've gotten so far behind that the only way we're going to be able to catch them up is to put them in special ed. They're tagged OHI, which is Other Health Impaired. Sometimes we have kids who are ADHD and they're not on medication and they get so far behind that sitting in a regular classroom with Section 504 accommodations is not going to help. We do the best we can and let me tell you-- we special ed teachers can work miracles :) I got a second grader with learning disabilities 3 years ago who couldn't even spell his own name and by fourth grade he scored higher than his general education peers on the state READING test.

Just a crazy amount of depth with it, but he was in special education too.   I think you are right about our school systems - if you’re not naturally good at math or science you get put into a class where you’re made to feel stupid, when i reality you just don’t care about math and science.

62409	0	a	This is one of the things my college courses in education taught me. Admit when you don’t know something and then model the correct researching to find the answer. Now that I’m a teacher, when my kids ask me something I don’t know I get excited to learn something new myself.   We use the smart board, so that kids can see how to select information, discriminate between valid and invalid sources, and talk about the process of research. It always opens up a great conversation and even though it screws up my lesson plans (I don’t get to what I had planned sometimes) it’s worth it because properly researching something you don’t understand is probably the most valuable skill you can have as an adult, IMO, and should be given more credit in the classroom.

62428	0	a	Despite what the name may suggest, New College is one of Oxford’s oldest. Founded in 1379, at its heart lies a dining hall that features expansive oak beams across its ceiling. About a century ago, an entomologist discovered that the beams were infested with beetles and would need replacing. The College agonized over where they might find oaks of sufficient size and quality to make new beams. Then, as Stewart Brand recounts,  One of the Junior Fellows stuck his neck out and suggested that there might be some worthy oaks on the College lands. These colleges are endowed with pieces of land scattered across the country which are run by a college Forester. They called in the College Forester, who of course had not been near the college itself for some years, and asked him if there were any oaks for possible use.  He pulled his forelock and said, “Well sirs, we was wonderin’ when you’d be askin’.”  Upon further inquiry it was discovered that when the College was founded, a grove of oaks had been planted to replace the beams in the dining hall when they became beetly, because oak beams always become beetly in the end. This plan had been passed down from one Forester to the next for over five hundred years saying “You don’t cut them oaks. Them’s for the College Hall.”

62430	0	a	I planted around 10-15 trees in an orchard with my Grandpa about 15 years ago. At the time, I remember my parents having to convince me to do it, reminding me that he wouldn’t be around forever and that I should savour those moments while I could. He died 7 years ago and of course I very fondly look back on that memory now and every time I visit the orchard - once a year probably. The trees have grown from tiny shrubs to quite substantial things in the intervening period. When I’m there, I sit under a tree at the top of the orchard and think about my Grandpa; he was quite the character - an eccentric man, a surgeon and also a Captain in the Royal Artillery, who fought right though the War on various fronts, including being present at the evacuation of Dunkirk. A great man and a great memory!

62473	0	a	Even more reason for it to not be BJJ. It looks just like karate. But red/blue can be assigned even when you're not sparring. I'd go with the latter since his belt isn't worn in or an appropriate size, meaning he was probably given it for this event, and it isn't the one he trains in. Otherwise it'd be well-worn where the knot is tied. Belts only sit like his when they're new.

62484	0	a	Brene brown has covered some interesting research on this. It has a name, but I forget. Basically, it’s a common coping strategy but people who have actually had the worst happen say it did not prepare them at all. It only stopped them from enjoying the good things they did have, while they had them.  She suggests a better strategy is to acknowledge what you’re fearful of, recognize that this is scary because you care about it and try to also appreciate the thing you care about instead of focusing on fear of the loss.

I realized that my brain was tricking me to take the risk of spending only one quarter on a parking meter rather than two and rush to complete whatever errand it was in the 8 or 10 minutes I had, risking a $75 parking ticket rather than spend another 25 cents. Predictably this behavior eventually resulted in said pricey parking ticket. At that point I decided to examine where else in my life I should put the extra quarter in rather than try to avoid a minor discomfort at a hefty price."

62510	0	a	"This is basically what happened with my mom. She was abused as a kid and never really had a safe home or felt loved by her parents. And while that abuse caused her a lot of issues down the line as an adult, one good thing that did come out of it was she knew exactly what she didn't get as a child, and worked extra hard to provide that for me.  She was an awesome parent (both my parents were) and I'm forever grateful to her for that.   However, it doesn't always work out quite that well. Her siblings, who were subject to the same abuse, did not both turn out the same way. Her brother did, and is a fantastic father to his two kids, but her sister fell back into the exact same patterns of abuse with her own daughters that she experienced as an adult.   It's very easy, I think, for me as a kid who had a very normal childhood to look at this quote and be like, ""Yeah! Why doesn't everyone do this!"", but it's hard in practice when you're an actual victim of abuse to remove yourself far enough from your experiences and consider how you can grow from it and improve on your parents' model when you raise your own kids.  Many people fall into the trap of just emulating their parents, which is great for people who had great parents (I know I will be attempting to emulate my parents in many respects when I have kids), but for people who were victims of abuse, it just perpetuates the cycle.

Most people have so few positive things said about them that anything, especially things they've made a conscious choice about such as their fashion or an attempt to improve such as going to the gym or watching their diet, are great sources of happiness if you comment positively about them.  So giving them a compliment isn't about you or your opinion, it's about putting aside your ego to make someone else feel good. That's the super power.   Shoot for the moon golden Lincoln man! 
62523	0	a	"True story.  I was facing homelessness at 18. Back injury from a hit and run on my now worthless bike. Couldn't keep my job because of received threats from my abuser. No car. No phone. No computer. I had a selfish boyfriend that is completely the wrong person for me but all I had for a support system. All I wanted to do was finish the school semester at community college and it seemed like even that was now impossible. I was about to lose the room I was renting because I ran out of my savings and felt like all the hopes and dreams I was holding onto were no longer mine to own.  I sat alone in front of a municipal lake, wondering what the fuck I got myself into. How could I allow my blind optimism to believe that starting a new life for myself would turn out okay? It's not okay. It won't be okay. It may never again be okay.  A man within a few years of my age has a huge but shy smile on him some distance from me. I watched him for an hour or so meander closer towards me, then further away, then a little closer, then back, and so on. There were times where he would stare at the wading ducks in the water like they were the most interesting thing in the world, holding his hand up to his mouth to cover a smile. It was the middle of the afternoon and tons of people were around so I didn't feel threatened.  He's now 15 feet away. I get up and start to leave and he's like ""Wait miss, please! I'm a chicken shit.""  ""You're a what?""  ""I'm a chicken shit. I'm sorry. I wanted to come up sooner but I didn't want you to think I was trouble. I have to say something.""  Who the fuck is this guy. ""Ok?""  ""You seemed really sad, and I don't know what's going on in your life but I promise things will get better. I'm Ariel.""  Ariel appears next to a body of water to tell me this world that I don't understand how to navigate and may be just as fucked as the last one I was in... Would be okay.   We talk for awhile. I share my fears. I cry. He chokes up but does not cry. We talk for another hour or so. He is embarrassed by his ""Disney girl name"" and I'm like ""no dude, that's Shakespeare!"" He smiles again and holds eye contact and we talk some more. I tell him about The Tempest. He tells me that I'm beautiful, smart, courageous, but never inches close for physical connection. Never asks for my number. Eventually we get up, say goodbyes and I offer to hug him. We walk separate ways.   Ariel saved me from giving up on myself when all I could see was darkness. I didn't scream or shut down some dude trying to muster the courage to talk to a pretty girl. A brief exchange between two young people had what I want to believe was significant positive impact on one another.   Legitimately, he saved my life."

Just a stranger smiling at me makes me happy because they're happy and for whatever reason they choose to show me that happiness. It's the only compliment I've ever recieved by a stranger.

I’m a smiley person in general, which was weird where I grew up and fits in more where I live now. But since I grew up where people tended to be a little more reserved and suspicious, I always feel a bit “guilty” for randomly smiling at strangers and worry they might call me out on it (I know, I’m weird. lol)  But you saying a stranger’s happiness makes you happy, too, is kind and selfless and exactly what I think, too, when I see someone smile at me.

62551	0	a	If you know anything about straps you can clearly see they aren't strapped to the bar.  
62552	0	a	If you’re talking about her dropping the weights after making the lift it’s because it’s so heavy that you can’t just set it down normally, and it’s ok to drop a bar with plates like that because they’re designed to be dropped from overhead, they’re called bumper plates. 
62553	0	a	Can confirm. Can squat 405 can't even snatch 95 pounds 
62554	0	a	This isn't a lift you can spot. The lifter should know how to fail safely if something goes wrong.
62555	0	a	there is no spot for the snatch lift. if you can't hit it, dump it. most people will get close to getting it, but dump it in front of them when they know they dont have the lift
62556	0	a	Mine is all old people.

62563	0	a	I'm sure you could power snatch it easily. It'd be a legal lift in competition.
62564	0	a	If she lifting it safely though?  It appears to me if she was to give up on it while it's over her head, it would come falling down on her back and lower back before she would have a chance to get out of the way.  Or is it just a bad angle shot to where it appears as though she doesn't have her rear out as far as I think while arching her head forward.  edit:  Awesome, ask a question because it looks unsafe and people just pile on downvotes.

62569	0	a	What is the correct term for it? Bar?
62570	0	a	Yea, not empty. You dont drop an empty bar, because then the thing hitting the ground is the bearings and not the plates, which will damage them.
62571	0	a	Maybe. I think it's a range of motions thing more than anything. That movement terrifies me 
62572	0	a	If she failed, she'd just jump backwards and drop the bar in front of her
62573	0	a	It's a lift you have to practice a lot for form before you can get the weight up. Most people who practice this lift have done it enough times to know when they're going to fail before it get to that dangerous point. Normally just dropping. It in front and letting their arms push it forward a bit as it falls.
62574	0	a	And the stock market  And your job  And life in general.

62625	0	a	I work at a gym selling memberships. It's a pretty fun job. A lot of people probably think folks walking around parking lots and soliciting are miserable, but I'd much rather do that than be stuck in an office. Plus, I get to meet amazing people, and I do my best to try to help as many people as I can. I get most of my job is being an annoying shit and pushing memberships, but there's moments than remind me how much I love being alive.  Yesterday, I met a man putting oil in his Honda Civic outside a Walmart. I offered a gym membership, he said it was a bad time, he was going through a rough patch. So I put my sales stuff away, and just told him I'd like to listen.  Turns out he's a homeless ex-marine with a wife and kid. He served two tours in Iraq and fought a lot in Baghdad. He saved up his checks to buy a car, and he and his wife and child lived out of that. He didn't ask for money, or help, or anything. I just lent an ear and listened. We shared stories. I'd gone through some stuff too, abusive parents and whatnot. By the end, we were both hugging it out. I like to think I helped him, but really, he helped me just as much. I don't know where he is now, or what is name is, but I hope he's doing well.  Anyways, the moral is to never stop fighting. Every day above ground is a good one, and every time you can help another human being makes it even better. If anybody needs to talk, please send me a message. I don't care what it's about, I just like to listen. I hope you all have a great rest of the day.

62633	0	a	" > -In 2008 I attempted suicide. I felt so overwhelmed, like I was useless and I would never amount to anything. A counselor visited me in the hospital and we talked for a while. At the end of our conversation she asked me, ""Are you going to be okay tonight or am I going to have to worry about you?"" I didn't know what to say. I broke down. Sometimes it just takes the kindness of a stranger to show you that you do matter.   Feels hit me like a Mack "
62634	0	a	"Been wanting to share this for a very long time. Now, I feel like I can help. Met her when we were eight years old. Always joked about growing up and getting married. I moved away for about ten years then Moved back for my last year of high school and got her pregnant. Worked more than a slave for the next ten years. Had children, a house, two cars and everything I thought anyone could ask for.. Maybe it wasn't the nicest of the nicest material things but it was more than the average household along with unconditional love. All she had to do was be an awesome mother, wife, and a person. But as you probably know, when you think you have life figured out, that's when Life will kindly remind you, ""Fuck you!"" Found her texting an old friend, completely blamed everything on me and forced me into a divorce. That was the 21st day of June exactly 90 days later she made our 8 year old daughter hand me our divorce papers. Because of my ignorance and trusting her to do the right thing, she was able to move nine hours away with my children with her new boyfriend. She was now pregnant. I fell into a three year drugged induce Zombie living Coma. I lost everything I ever built financially, spiritually, and most important I lost my children. I thought I was at the end of the road with only death or prison in my sights. This sub LITERALLY changed my life. Now, these past two years, I've been re-building myself. My children and I have the strongest bond ever, I drive a 2ss convertible, women find me attractive often, and living a Life I thought was over with for sure. I help people in situations like I was in and reach out whenever I can help. Divorce is a horrible experience. I wouldn't wish for my enemies. Everything happens for a reason. Always always always Smile through it all because after all, they can't take away your Smiles. "
62635	0	a	Going through a break up right now. It hasn't been 2 months. In the heat of the moment, anything seems possible.  I tell myself what's more important, the girl or every other fucking thing I can do with my whole life. Doesn't make it easier. At least not yet.  It's hard going from having plans with a special person who thinks you're just as special, to just having yourself. And not doing everything we all talked about.  I have 2 side chicks I see regularly, but I still feel numb. Girls just aren't what they used to be. I feel enlightened, like I know how great it can all be. But none of them are her.  Girls just aren't the same
62636	0	a	"Breakups can be as bad on some people as going cold turkey when a heavy opioid addict. It's sometimes just as serious for one's physical health.   Kinda insane. That said, it's usually likely when this happens that more is going on mentally. Potential mental illness that hasn't exhibited yet can. Not saying it happened in this case but men can generally exhibit the first major episode of a mental condition from 18-25 and usually during times of extreme stress and emotion.   Okay, I looked at possible citations, they didn't seem appropriate or useful for this context. If disappointed I didn't cite a study on voles you're welcome to find it yourself. This however seemed best.   ""4:36 And then, the very last question — I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say, ""Would you die for him or her?"" And, indeed, these people would say ""Yes!"" as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it.  4:58 So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity in a lot of brain regions. In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed, that's exactly what happens.  5:26 I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low. But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive.  5:54 And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, ""No, thank you,"" you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow.""  -Helen Fischer 2006 [TED Talk. Why we love, why we cheat. ](http://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat?utm_source=tedcomshare&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tedspread)    Yeah, to lazy for citations. Google works though for more info.    Edit: holy shit this comment blew up. At the time of posting I was sitting on the toilet. I have a tad bit of personal experience with mental health and suicide from many perspectives personally. Later today I'll look into posting some good links on this post and try and respond to everyone.   Just a quick thing to add. If you're in a crisis, call 911 and tell the person that you're suicidal and need help. They will respond accordingly.   "

If we could focus on this side, and make these individuals role models we possibily would have less police falling into the dark side sigma.  I think deep down everyone desires to respectable.  Being respectible doesn't mean you have to be manly, and this is the biggest problem testosterone driven police.  Edit:  I know sigma might mean different things.  To clarify I mean it as the extreme standard deviations in the bell curve distribution.

62646	0	a	I know the struggle. It's been four months for me now after being together for 5 years. I was getting ready to buy an engagement ring.   It sucks. It really does and it's going to suck for a while. I've hooked up with another girl but I can't get that connection anymore. It's not the same and it's not who I wanted it with. This girl wasn't great to me but we had a connection like no other. And it's awful going from someone being around all the time to just yourself.   All I can say is, let yourself be upset. No matter how good of a day you have, don't be afraid to be sad at the end. I have it constantly. I go out with new friends and have the time of my life, but at the end of the night, I sit in my car screaming at the top of my lungs just asking why I'm not good enough. I scream and cry and grab the steering wheel and shake the whole car. I do it until I can't anymore. But then something happens. I feel great afterwards. I start to smile and wipe away the tears because I know no matter what, I'm strong enough to get through it and know that one day someone will come into my life and knock me off my feet.   You can get through this! I believe in you and if you ever need to talk, PM me. I'm here for you. You're important. Don't ever forget that. 
62647	0	a	Yeah I broke up with a girl at 19 years of age. Happened at 10am that morning.   2pm that afternoon after knowing my mind was being very, very strange and having had gone to the doctors and hospital and been turned away, I took over 100 pills and passed out.  The police kicked in my door, gave me CPR, hospital filled me with charcoal and I woke up 1pm the next day.   Break ups can fuck up a young delicate mind.  Edit: Delicate not dedicate

Between 1937 and 2012, an estimated 1,600 bodies were recovered of people who had jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, located in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States. The impact from the fall kills 98 percent of people who jump or fall from the bridge, as they enter the water. (Wikipedia)  People come from all over the world to jump off that bridge.

62670	0	a	When my dad's mom was dying, confined to the bed, he and his brother were attending to her beside. She suddenly mentioned that there was a leak in her bathroom and could they take a look at it. So, my dad and uncle searched out the leak and discovered it was a pipe behind the wall. They told my grandma and she asked them to fix it, so they got their tools and opened up the wall. Then they realized they needed to move the toilet, so they disconnected the bowl and started breaking into the wall behind the toilet. It was about four hours into their endeavor when they realized they were fixing a bathroom she'd never use again. For no reason. They went back into the bedroom and she was laying there just smiling at them.   It felt wrong for her boys to be in the house and not doing something for her, so she'd given them something to do. As she'd gotten weaker, they'd become more parental towards her - as we do with aging parents. But, that role reversal never sits well and so she'd needed to make the point that she was their mom up until the end. It worked.

It is much easier to study groups of people by the choices they make rather than arbitrary genetic variations.  Edit-in-response-to-edit: If it is not intentional it is not racism. When we were toddlers my grandfather, god rest his soul, used to chase us around his house saying ""Come here you cotton picker!"". He would also use cotton-picking in a derogatory fashion rather than cursing. It was a lot of fun at the time (90's) but at one point my brother made the connection and asked my grandfather: ""Who picks cotton?"". His eyes went wide and to my knowledge he never uttered the phrase again. He passed back in January in his sleep in his mid 80's. He was pretty cool.

I was ashamed to be doing something at the age of 30 that I should have done many years ago, so I was hesitant to even tell anyone (well I still haven’t tbh) except my immediate family. Then, I started thinking that not everyone starts out on a level playing field, some people have to work harder than others for certain things, some people have obstacles to overcome and take longer than others to accomplish things and there isn’t anything wrong with that. We all have different paths and we can’t control everything life throws at us, and that’s okay

However, despite that feeling, I have a 4.0 and I'm in honors! I don't know how long it will take me to get a bachelors in mechanical engineering at this rate, but I'm surviving so far, so I just hope I make it to the end. I'm so tired of being a server.

After that I decided moving back home to North Dakota to work in the oilfield was my best choice. After getting laid off 3 years on the job, decided I wanted to do more, I decided to go back and get my engineering degree. I will graduate in a few weeks at age 34 ( more than 10 years older than most of my classmates.  I got married 2 months ago to my SO of 10 years. It has been unorthodox path so far but it is working for me.

I start a job at McDonald’s on Wednesday. During my job hunt I realised there are Marine certifications you can literally just pay for. I’m booked on a 2 week Marine engine course in May. Full room and board (on the isle of whight)and I will return a fully MCA certified Diesel engine engineer. When I pass that one I will go on to do a few more courses which my McDonald job will pay for. The courses aren’t all that expensive and I have experience in boat building and crew experience so it’s right up my street. It’s like I’ve found the path I’ve been struggling to find for ten years. I’m so excited about getting all these certificates and being able to apply for jobs anywhere there is a port (worldwide). Plus I think it will be quite fun working at McDonald’s for a bit. It’s 300m away from my house. It’s perfect, the stars are aligning I feel like.

I had gone about a quarter mile when a woman stopped and helped me put it in the back of her SUV. I told her about how people just drive right past and she said regrets not helping people on the side of the road and she’s going to from now on. So I guess we both helped each other a bit!

No luck. So I decide ""fuck it ill pretend im unconcious then someone will stop."" With the way I was feeling playing unconcious didn't feel at all a stretch from reality. So I lay down in the grass and scatter the boxes with fans all around me to make it look like I fell and they flew everywhere. Someone stopped within 30 seconds.  Moral of the story? If people arent stopping, maybe you aren't acting helpless ENOUGH."

62864	0	a	This quote saved me from suicide. I had been depressed for years, and every day just felt more grueling than the last. Then I found this show and I really resonated with Bojack’s character.

Thank god I got to hear this quote, and I can confirm, ever since every day has gotten a little easier :)   Don’t give up :)  Edit: Thanks so much for all the kind words! You are all amazing, and I just wanna hijack my top comment and say that I just discovered this great new Facebook messenger bot called “Woebot” which uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help you get through your tough times. I suggest it to anyone with Mild depression, it’s helped me so much to figure out my feelings and how to deal with them! If you’re feeling suicidal then there’s hotlines, but if everyday depression is ailing you then I really suggest using this bot. It was developed by top Stanford psychologists in behavioral therapy, and it’s great because no one ever actually reads your conversations. It’s just you and the bot, figuring out your feelings. Here’s the link for those interested :)  https://www.woebot.io

Force yourself to hang out with family and make time for friends. Find at least one hobby and try to dedicate a few hours a week to it.   I think the best way though is to volunteer. Volunteering makes you feel great! And you meet other cool people. And you're doing a great thing for your community. And it looks good on your resume.  We're in a get motivated sub so this is perfect. Because the truth is, you're always going to be depressed unless you give it an honest shot to get out of it. And that's why depression is terrible. It's because it tells you you won't get out of it. For example, the reason anti-depressants have a side affect of suicide isn't because it tampers with chemicals in your brain. It's because it gives you the motivation to finally do it. The only thing stopping a lot of people with depression is a lack of motivation. So you have to force yourself to make an honest effort every day. And just like the quote above, it really does get easier.

62896	0	a	About 10 years ago, in the last wedding of the year that I conducted, the groom was 70 and the bride was 74. They were widowed and had been friends for some time. Just the families would attend, I was told. That turned out to be a lot of people, and with grandbabies running up and down the aisles, it was quite a lively affair, and very poignant.

I took the break because i felt i was failing, I wasn’t accomplishing the things I need to accomplish as fast as I should have, I took longer in school etc. i was feeling defeated and shit really. I needed this. This was beautiful. Everything we do is right because we are living our life. There is no wrong. Everything that brought us here happened for some reason, be it your decisions another’s decisions, and if you believe, Gods decision. There is nowhere else you are supposed to be other than right here. Hell, maybe you shouldn’t even exist but you do and it has brought you to this specific time and point. Every moment is your moment and you live it to its fullest or to its littlest. It is your life, one that is unique, short and only happens once.

And if it's family/friends pressure you feel to rush success, just find role models that started late. Or failures that started early.

62920	0	a	Decided to go to med school when I was 30. But I had a degree in philosophy and almost no science coursework so I had to go back first to do all of my prerequisite science work. I almost died of anxiety when I didn’t get in the first year I applied to med school, but it all worked out because the next year I got into the program I really wanted to go to. Am currently about to finish my third year.  Will be 39 when I graduate and start residency.   Medical school is great, and coming to it with a little age and life experience puts you at a huge advantage  both in terms of your motivation and focus, but also just being able to talk with patients.   Good luck!

Your opinion on his religious views and the way he practices them are yours, and I share the same belief that it isn't right to be against gay people. But this is a getmotivated post, people should look to what they can on an individual to be motivated.   For example, aspects of Mother Teresa and Lance Armstrong could be viewed negatively, but if you choose to look at what you think is good and inspirational, you only have something to gain.   We do pick and choose our role models though. Just realize that everyone has a side that could be viewed as negative to another person. To a very strict conservative catholic, his vocalization on denouncing homosexuals could be viewed as honorable and respectable. It isn't the norm from where I'm from and I don't agree with it, but consider the Philippines and its religious climate.   As someone who overall thinks of Manny as a great inspiration of hard work and dedication, decent family man, an admired pinoy amongst his countrymen, I'd rather defend him being in this subrreddit.

63040	0	a	"Real talk. My wife and I are going through a serious rough patch. The last few years haven't been great, honestly. Without getting into all the details, we've dealt with my alcoholism and deeply hidden anxiety issues that grew exponentially when I sobered up. Those things, and my lack of effort to correct them, pushed her away, to the point of cheating on me. Which was a regrettable thing, but I have a history of cheating (before marriage, mind), so we've been trying to work through it. I'm mature enough and committed enough to want to give it an honest and sincere try. For my wife, my family, and my sanity.   I've been focused on bettering myself these past few weeks so I can be a better husband for her. It's been working. I'm a better person than I was even a month ago. And she noticed.  We had our ""first date"" tonight. And it went better than I could have hoped for. Way better. We never stopped loving each other, but tonight helped rekindle that spark. We're falling in love all over again. After 15 years together, we're getting to know each other again. And I'm just eating it up.  I guess my point is that all the cutesy stuff like Mr Drive Thru here matters. A lot. We both forgot that along the way, but we're starting to remember. So the real relationship goal is to find someone that makes you want to be a better person - *and actually motivated enough to follow through on that*. I'm so glad I get this opportunity to date her again, to get to know her all over again. And to show her that all the bullshit is *entirely* worth it.  Ramble, ramble. I'm just in a supremely good place right now, all because we're trying to remember these kinds of small-but-important gestures of love and appreciation."

63090	0	a	Does anyone have a link to the comic where it is revealed that Jameson is just buying the pictures to look out for peter and ends with him googling and finding out peter's uncle died?
63091	0	a	It's not that he was covering for spider man, he was covering for Peter. He still hates spidey, he just didn't want his employee to get hurt.
63092	0	a	Honestly, in the comics JJ finds out that Peter is Spider-Man and absolutely turns his life around for Pete's sake and it is so wholesome, he's actually a really good guy
63093	0	a	I feel like this was one of the big themes of the Raimi Spiderman Films; that all the people who are gruff and unpleasant in Peter's life all are good people when it counts.    Jonah Jameson would have died to protect Peter when assaulted by the Goblin, the New Yorkers attack the Goblin by throwing everything they can at him from the bridge, telling the Goblin that Spidey is one of them.  The people that he saves in the train protect his identity and stand between him and Doc Ock to protect him.  Peter's Slavic landlord that harasses him worries for him and tells everyone how good a kid he is in Spiderman 3.    I don't think that Flash Thompson is well featured after Peter leaves highschool in the Raimi films, but in the comics it is demonstrated that the jock that tries to bully Peter always wanted to be a hero and just needed the right example.  Spiderman becomes his idol, and he later becomes close friends with Peter, and becomes rather heroic himself in a quieter more realistic way.  (Until the Agent Venom storyline, then he becomes a legitimate superhero.)  I think that the films were trying to make a point about how people are inherently good, and worth protecting, even if they don't seem so on the surface.

63108	0	a	I have it but I don't remember the issue, I can tell you later when I get home.
63109	0	a	I don’t know about the Uncle Ben part, but this definitely happened in the Civil War comic when Peter reveals his identity to the public.  Jonah goes on about how he felt the ultimate betrayal from this, because he always thought in this messed up world that Peter was genuinely one of the good ones. He mentioned he always bought Peter’s shots even if they weren’t always good just to help him out.
63110	0	a	I don’t have a link, but I’ve always enjoyed that JJJ is an unimaginable asshole who is good at heart and is a journalist with standards. Always makes me smile and one of my favorite comic book side characters, he’s too fucking ridiculous.  *Strongly* recommend the Chip Zdarsky Peter Parker run - Jameson finds some things out about Spidey and suddenly becomes his most vehement supporter, in the most obnoxious JJJ way. The annual where he has to reckon with his past creating the Spider-Slayer program and other past mistakes is straight FIRE.
63111	0	a	Jonah is deep down a good guy. He's very pro Mutant rights and civil rights in general, he just doesn't like vigilantes
63112	0	a	Ya, but he fired Peter every time he saw him.
63113	0	a	I mean it's pretty clear he was negative to Peter as well. It's less to do with Spider-Man and more to do with Jameson's character.
63114	0	a	JJ has really only been a bad guy when he’s either wrong about something or protecting his family. Really not a bad guy, and Parker knows it.
63115	0	a	Do you remember which comics?

63120	0	a	Yeah he’s trying to get the truth to the people and got half false information from what he knows to be a trustworthy source
63121	0	a	Reminds me of Leo Szilard.  He was the man responsible for the atomic bomb. His theories convinced the other far more well known scientists like Einstein, Teller, and Oppenheimer. They intensely hated him but looked up to his intelligence. They called him the most intelligent man they had ever met.   But he was a massive asshole and everyone hated him. They couldn’t stand him. He was repulsive.  After the atomic bomb was successful and the war ended, most of the European scientists were unable to see their families because they came from nations which became the Soviet zone after the war, and the Soviets had rounded up the scientist’s families in Prison camps to interrogate them about their relative’s work on the American atomic bomb project.   Most of the scientists were forced to flee the Nazis 10+ years earlier and leave their extended families behind. Many of their remaining family members died during the war, and most of the survivors fell into Soviet hands. The scientists were desperate to finally see their surviving families again and save them from the Soviet prison camps.   The scientists tried to get the Soviets to release their families but they refused.   But after the other scientists repeatedly failed to get their families released by the Soviets, Leo walked up to the Hungarian ambassador who was with the Soviet delegation, and said something to him in Hungarian.   Apparently the Soviets owed him a favor and he used it to get the families released.   Decades later Teller almost cried when he was interviewed about it. He hated Leo but he was overwhelmingly grateful for being able to see his dying mother and for having his sister freed as well. Hes not a very emotional man, but he clearly becomes emotional when recalling what Szilard did for him.   Szilard ended up dedicating the remainder of his life to cooperation and peace between the US and Soviet Union, and was responsible for the “red phone” nuclear hotline being set up in order to allow conflict to be avoided during emergency situations.   Who would have thought such a hated person would end up being such a peacemaker?
63122	0	a	Later on in that same series when Peter dies I think there is a full page or even 2 page spread of JJ starting a memorial article on him but he keeps breaking down and starting over because it's not a good enough eulogy for Peter
63123	0	a	Peter Parker was his employee and photographer who gave him the pictures but he didn't snitch.
63124	0	a	And his son. You know, the astronaut
63125	0	a	I remember in the old animated series from the 90s, when new evidence came out that revealed Eddie Brock was lying, he publicly denounced his role in the misinformation campaign and withdrew his reward for the apprehension of spiderman.

63133	0	a	This hits me hard. I worked at the local paper when I lost my sister to... newsworthy circumstances.  Of course we had to run a story.

63135	0	a	Tbh peters running a scam
63136	0	a	Wait he was pro mutant rights? I admit I haven’t gone into the comics but I would’ve thought I’d hear about this somewhere.   The vigilante thing though makes perfect sense.
63137	0	a	I mean, he does damage other peoples property to stop muggers. probably doing more cost in damage than was being stolen. And since he's never held accountable for it, does insurance even cover that damage? So even though crime goes down, a lot of people probably pay more in insurance.  Not to mention how villians wreck half the neighbourhood every time they try to find him.   HE IS A MENACE!

63142	0	a	Jimothy Johnny Jameson
63143	0	a	He's a lawful good type through and through. He doesn't want to unmask spiderman because he's evil, he wants to do it because Spiderman is a masked vigilante and isn't accountable to anyone and that goes against JJ's core beliefs as a journalist that power should have a check on it. But as we see in the op, he would also give his life to protect those around him. He's a strong character and I like him because he shows that just because a character is mean or short tempered, doesn't mean they aren't good.

63170	0	a	Definitely amateur level photography when he started and hopefully got better as time went on.
63171	0	a	"Reminds me of the ""Negative Exposure"" storyline.  A rival photographer is angry that Peter's pictures keep making it to the front page.  He's a photography snob and thinks his own pictures deserve it because they have better composition, etc, while Peter just seems to be pointing and shooting.  So the photographer teams up with Doc Ock to take down Spider-Man.  Doc Ock betrays him, and in a last ditch effort to redeem himself, the photographer tears off Ock's goggles and uses his camera flash to blind him.  From his prison cell, he sees that one his photos finally made the front page - but it's the one he took to blind Doc Ock.  And since he just pointed and shot without regard for the composition, it ended up looking just like one of Peter's photos.  That's just from memory, but I think that's how it went."
63172	0	a	Of course. Mandatory bereavement. I tried to argue I didn’t even need time off but he wasn’t having any of it.

Once she was married in, they never taught her Royal protocol, so whenever she messed up they'd ridicule and shame her. The tabloids did the same. She was under intense scrutiny without anyone showing her what to do. And the Royals did nothing to help with the intense paparazzi that were harassing her. Charles neglected her to cheat with Camilla (even writing her love letters during their honeymoon). Meanwhile Diana had to pretend everything was perfect between them.  Diana was very depressed and developed a horrible eating disorder.  She couldn't leave to make friends (she couldn't talk freely for fear of her issues making it to the tabloids), and every move she made outside the palace was documented by the paparazzi. When she asked the Queen what to do about her loveless marriage, the Queen basically shrugged and said ""I don't know"". Diana attempted suicide by throwing herself down the stairs, and even cut herself in front of the Queen in desperation as a cry for help. The Queen labeled her as unstable and tried to avoid seeing her completely (except for public events). Once Diana got divorced she found her strength and freedom, but was still isolated  due to the pressure of the paparazzi (as she had become so insanely popular for standing up to the Royal family... She was the most photographed woman in the world when she died, taking the title from Marilyn Monroe, and to this day is still second to the Queen).  She started doing charity work because she figured if her every move would be documented, she could shine a light on worthy causes, like HIV and the threat of landmines.  Edit; [Here's a video of her walking through a landmine area](https://youtu.be/Ua4c_7uyjx8). They begged her not to because it was too risky, but she insisted. And when the cameras didn't get the right shot, *she did it again*. I'm just posting this to show you how badass she was when it came to representing her causes."

People were scared they would die, the medicine wasnt accessible or viable, people didn't know how it was transmitted and it was feared that it would be like hepatitis or other contagious diseases. HIV is still stigmatized to this day, but it was completely outrageous in the 80s and 90s. To compare Princess Diana, someone who advocated for HIV understanding and treatment, to Nancy Reagan, who disbanded her ""friend,"" Rock Hudson, when he came to her for help in finding treatment, really puts into perspective what a public figure can do for the public. To close out, fuck the Reagans; scum of the earth and glad they're gone. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk!"

63301	0	a	She was already married and had a kid by that point. And even before that, she wasn't a virgin when she met Charles and therefore was not an option.
63302	0	a	Also because she (Camilla) was divorced so she wasn't allowed to be in the family,especially since she had her own child outside of the Royal family. So they tried to get someone who could be a queen.. So they chose the People's Princess Diana.  After her death, when times have changed on the views of divorce, they allowed Charles and Camilla to marry. However, if Charles outlives the Queen, he will become King but Camilla will not be queen. The Queen does not want Camilla with any sort of power so that's presumably why she's keeping her crown for so long; currently the longest reigning Monarch. As much as Elizabeth didn't like Diana and is thought to be involved in her death, Elizabeth hates Camilla more. She would rather William become King VS Charles.

63308	0	a	They do a lot of charity work, like a lot. Another is that they create a lot of tourism but its a debatable how much they generate compared to anything. Really ingrained in our culture though, I feel an odd bit of loyality towards the Royals even though I have no connection to them.
63309	0	a	Nope it's not! The expectations have changed. Meghan was even a divorcee.  After both her sons got divorced, the Queen allowed Diana's sons to marry for love in order to avoid a similar fate.
63310	0	a	Not any more. No mention was made of it regarding Kate (there was an announcement for Diana, which is just gross), and Meghan was previously married. Not that long ago, the King had to abdicate because he married a divorcée. Things have loosened up somewhat, thank fuck.

63315	0	a	If she ever exercised her supposed power it would amount to an abdication. I can imagine she'd do it in the case of a serious breach of her principle, however for the most part the Queen actively takes no part in politics.
63316	0	a	Charles and Diana’s divorce was super messy.   It’s the only reason why the Queen relaxed her rules for her grandkids. Better to marry a commoner for love than to go through an embarrassing divorce. Being a royal is all about managing appearances, and getting a divorce means you can’t claim to be better than the masses (the underlying assumption being that marriage should be easy since royal couples don’t have to worry about any of the normal issues that cause divorce - money and kids draining money).
63317	0	a	I think it also had a lot to do with the publics view of monarchy was not great after the treatment of Diana and a lot of people found the royal family too cold and aloof. Having William and Harry marry out of love does a lot to humanize the crown.

Anyways I show up late and everything is taken, besides these three desks with this weird ass kid in one of them. I realized he was pretty chill he just had a hard time expressing himself to others without coming off strange. He was really into anime and he was the kid that would naruto run down the hallway. Anyways I didn’t know anything about anime but dragon ball z so we would talk about that and shit I would see him in the hallway and ask him how he was doing and all of that, then Christmas break rolls around we have a half day before we get let out for two weeks and he gives me this watch as a present and tells me thank you for being his friend. Also we were dirt poor so now that I think about it that was like the only thing I got for Christmas that year tbh. His name was Caleb and he was a good guy at heart. (:

People joked that he was the most likely to go postal and kill us all one day.  When I finally met him, I really didn't know what to expect. He was an older dude who always wore cowboy boots and those old-fashioned gold-rimmed aviator-style glasses. He was a super awkward guy, but he seemed nice. I always got along with him.  When I left that job, we all went out for dinner and drinks, including him. And as is usual with a big drunken group, we ended up with not enough money to pay the bill at the end of the night (people leaving early and not leaving money for their share, people miscalculating what they owe – you know). Nobody knew this though. Because this guy quietly covered the difference. I only found out weeks later.  Super nice guy. Just really really socially awkward.

Sadly he past away from a brain tumor and malpractice of the hospital and i miss him everyday. Sorry for the long sad story, but please treat everyone as an equal it would change their lifes.

He didn’t irritate me as much as he did other people and I didn’t mind keeping him company at group functions and other get-togethers. Well, he was very good at math and landed a stellar internship his summer before senior year. Well next summer they were looking for interns again - he was a year older and had been hired full time. The position would’ve been great experience for me, but it was a highly competitive spot.  As it turned out, the guy on my floor raved about me and really pushed for them to hire me. He was the reason I started working there and what launched my career. It’s been ten years and I wouldn’t be anywhere near where I am without his help. Sometimes it pays off to show a little patience and tolerance. It’s a lesson I try to remind myself of every now and again.

It's now 4 months in and this week I gave up on sitting in the break room at lunch and now go sit in my car, at least I don't have to listen to everyone else having conversations with their work friends now.  Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone. I'm trying to get over my anxiety and initiate convos, my voice comes out very weak though. The few times I've tried I've felt shut out of the convo very shortly after, kinda like lurking in a chat room but doesn't feel quite as nice.  I do try to make my cubicle inviting. I have some of my drawings up and Harry Potter stuff as well as a picture from my vacation. I have some nice peppermints in a dish for people to take when they walk by, it's popular. I also contribute to the break room, bringing in nicer tea bags and coffee than the company provides and sometimes I'll even buy a box of chips or cookies from Sam's and leave them there for people to eat.

63337	0	a	That reminds me of the dollar my husband has in his wallet (we're European and live in Germany so we don't have dollars as currency). One time he was working in a kitchen and they had this Polish dude who was the dishwasher. His German wasn't very good and as he was the bottom of the kitchen hierarchy, he was generally treated like shit. My husband is a generally friendly person and thinks any social hierarchy is complete BS so he always made an effort to be friendly to the Polish dishwasher. So one day the Polish guy wanted to give my husband a little souvenir of their friendship when one of them was leaving. He didn't have anything as a gift but he had a dollar bill so he would remember him. My husband has forgotten this guy's name and lost touch a long time ago, but he still carries that dollar in his wallet to this day.

I did see him working at a local sandwich shop a few months ago and when we both saw each other we had big smiles on our faces and we did that whole small talk chat catching up thing, you know how it goes, but it was really busy so he couldn’t stay and talk. He seems to be doing okay. I could tell he matured a lot from that time but he still seems to be a weird kid and you know that’s all cool because weird is fucking awesome in 2019.

I can't imagine how difficult it is to have lost such a great friend but he's now remembered by one more person, a stranger on the Internet knows that he touched your life in a positive way. I hope that helps you a little, knowing that someone else got the experience a glimpse of how great of a person he was. I'm deeply sorry for your loss. You were a great friend to him and I'm sure he appreciated you even more than he actually let on.

63354	0	a	It's too common unfortunately. Our older installers were doing this to our younger installers for being inexperienced and we end up going through installers quickly.   Took one of the main guys aside and flat out told him how would he feel if I treated his daughter like that for not having 10 years of experience using excel spread sheets - He quit being a dick but unfortunately the new tech that was currently being bullied just couldn't handle it and resigned a couple weeks later.

63359	0	a	"One my greatest life lessons:  In high school I worked as a bus boy.  Busboys & Dishwashers are constantly messing with each other.  Me and this one dishwasher, had to be in his 20s, me in my late teens, were really good at messing with each ohter.  In a Guy vs Guy friendly way.  Guys get it, girls think we hated each other.  But really we were like best work buds.   Anyhow my birthday comes around.  The dishwashers have a tradition of spraying anyone who's birthday it is at the end of their shift.  I knew this.  He knew this.  I kept outsmarting him and avoiding the spray.  The headcook/co-owner is in the office and I walk by.  He pulls me in.  He's noticing me outsmarting the dishwasher and he knows the tradition.  He tells me:  > Look you're probably going to go to college. You're going to make way more money then this guy will ever see.  He's not the smartest guy but he works hard.  This spray people on their birthday thing is one of the few things in his life where he gets to ""win"".  So just pretend like your avoiding him but make sure he sprays you good.  Give this to him.  It really opened my punk eyes up.  It really just opened my eyes to how the world works and how some people just got shitty brains."
63360	0	a	Damn. You just reminded me of the 5 pound note in my wallet, I'm American. A coworker went to the UK for vacation a few years back and I was one of the last people he saw to give a souvenir to. He ended up running out of stuff, but gave me that instead. About a year later, he was diagnosed with cancer and ended passing a few months afterwards.   I still have the note in my wallet and he gave me the greatest gift, a dad joke. I pull my wallet and say it's really heavy and pull the bill out saying it's 5 pounds.

63372	0	a	I was bullied by my peers and an outcast in school,  I suffered from sudden panic attacks with no trigger where I cried hysterically thinking I was about to die. Years later I saw a really great therapist that told me the primal effects of this. She said when a person isn’t accepted by the group on the core level they feel fear and panic. We’re meant to be in pack and social and help one another survive. So basically not being accepted in the group makes a person think they will die.

63450	0	a	I am a year removed from finishing my Ph.D. in English. The feeling described here is amazing, don't get me wrong, but nothing compares to the feeling of finally finishing my dissertation.  I still remember it so clearly. It was around 11pm on a Wednesday and I was in my office on campus. I had finally finished proofreading every single goddamn page, including the bibliography and appendix (final page count: 292). I saved the file in 3 separate locations and emailed the final draft to myself. No way I was gonna leave anything up to chance.  I then took the bus home and got off one stop early, right in front of a local dive bar. My girlfriend was entertaining out of town friends, and that was perfect because I didn't want to talk to anyone in that moment. I just wanted to drink alone and *breathe*. The bartender asked me how my day was and I told him I had just finished my dissertation. He gave me a free shot and the few people sitting around the bar congratulated me. After an hour or so, I stumbled home in complete peace.

63477	0	a	One of my best friends was called back in and was handed a legal pad with three pages of scribbled notes, one of the council said “We have listed our concerns here, once addressed we can reconvene.”  It was 3 punctuation errors and 2 typos. Most of the notes were page, paragraph, line indicators written in really large handwriting. They let him fix them with a pen in 10 minutes.   “They handed me that thing and my heart fell out my butt. I still can’t believe that wanker did that to me.”
63478	0	a	I honestly find that a bit annoying. You've worked so hard, why would you play with someone's emotions like that? Just let them be happy, it's not always necessary to crack a joke.
63479	0	a	Can someone explain what does 'need for no reforms' mean? Does it mean they don't have to redo their Phd work?
63480	0	a	My PhD program actually stopped having these closed session final decision moments because of the occasional times when the student doesn’t pass. Super awkward to fly your whole family out to see your seminar and have them all waiting to party after the final decision only to find out you didn’t pass....  Side note: imo it’s a major failure of the committee if they allow a student to do a defense before they’re ready. But my department liked putting bandaids on symptoms instead of curing the disease ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
63481	0	a	I finished my doctorate about a year ago and at least for me it wasn't that bad.  If your committee is good they won't let you defend without being pretty much certain you'll pass.  If anything they're usually arguing about which edits to make. And while hearing that you passed is nice, the absolute best feeling is when you finally submit your dissertation to the library for publishing.  At that moment you are finally free.  
63482	0	a	Congrats on becoming a PhD! What in?
63483	0	a	A lot.     I just sort of exhaled and let a bunch of anxiety and tension.     Know one my friends apparently just started laughing maniacally and couldn’t actually talk coherently for about 5 minutes.
63484	0	a	I'd believe that lol. Not sure if they'd do that in this circumstance considering it was holding up a class but maybe
63485	0	a	"Been told the same by some while helping one of those ceremony.  He told me ""we only wait for the show, we've spent an hour trying to corner him with weird knowledge we often don't expect them to know and they do. That alone should do it"".  Plus, the one I was attending had two overseas profs in the comitee. You do not spend that kind of money when you know the guy will fail."
63486	0	a	What I've heard is that the student's advisor doesn't even allow his student to go to defend if the advisor isn't absolutely sure he will be successful. An unsuccessful defense looks horrible for the advisor, it's basically a done deal by the time you defend.
63487	0	a	I know you just spent years working endlessly towards this massive paper...but we really want to fuck with you
63488	0	a	Depends.  Shortest I've seen at a Master's level was about 20 minutes and the longest was almost 2 hours.  I'd imagine pHD defenses can stretch out pretty long.  That's years and years worth of dedicated research to present.
63489	0	a	I was talking with a grad student in my physics lab one time, and he said \~four hours.

63496	0	a	"Same! Except my  committee told me that I ""passed"" and didn't need to re-defend my master thesis. However, they also gave me a list of additional items to complete, so I'm still not done. I'm making progress, so hopefully I'll be actually done in a few weeks!"
63497	0	a	Man, my masters defense was the opposite.  I stumbled through the data part only to get lobbed softball questions from the one committee member completely out of the field.

63518	0	a	That depends what kind of Job you want, and what your PhD is in.  Doing a philosophy PhD isn't actually going to be all that useful for getting a non-academic job, and there are far, far more philosophy Post-Doc applicants than there are positions.  A friend of mine said she applied for a post-doctoral position and there were 200 applicants. All of them had a PhD by definition. 
63519	0	a	If you make it to your defense, it's almost impossible to fail. Any PhD candidate that made it into that room is gonna walk out a doctor so long as they can make it through the presentation. It takes 4-6 years to get into that room. All the failing pressure happened during that time. 
63520	0	a	Oh cool like Dr Dre?
63521	0	a	Yeah in the follow up tweets, the guy in the screenshot kept repeating that no advisor worth their salt would allow a dissertation to make it to the defense if it wasn’t good enough to succeed.

If someone isn't ready, their work is poor, or their research is shoddy, or whatever, it's on the advisor and the committee the stop the process. We then either try to fix the problem, or if it's not something that we can fix in a year or two, we award the candidate a Masters degree (for free) and tell them to hit the road.  Same thing with failing comprehensive exams or qualifying exams. Any person with an undergraduate degree could pass either with enough time and dedication. If the candidate fails it's generally because they were given poor advice and direction. I've seen lots of people fail out of grad school on comps, and in only a few cases can I say that it was the candidates' fault.

63532	0	a	"This is correct. The actual defense **should be** a formality. You present to your dissertation comittee - they have been working with you for YEARS at this point. You presented to them your idea, they accepted it, you did the work and checked in with them every so often. To fail at this point is rare, and when it happens it is heavily the result of a shit advisor (who should never let you defend if you aren't ready, aka your work is of the right quality and your paper is comprehensive).   When I was done defending my dissertation, I hung out in the hallway with my grad friend I had asked to take notes for me (protip - in case they ask you to change something during the talk, or point out an issue, have your friend take notes for you as you are fried at this point and unlikely to remember the details). When that doorknob turned 10 minutes later and my advisor said ""congratulations"", it was like the world became colorized again. Holy shit what an ordeal."

63543	0	a	Yes. You typically give a presentation (30 minutes to 1 hour) about your work.   You’ll then take questions about the work from any non-committee members (the public). The committee members might also ask a few questions.  Most of these are very short, maybe 15 minutes, and it’s usually a friend asking about something you previously talked about.   Then the public leaves and the committee asks harder questions about your work. They may be asking for clarity or to gauge your understanding. You will have also previously submitted your written dissertation and they will bring up any corrections they want to see. The committee may then move to more general questions about your field and high-level questions about the impact of your work.   You then leave. The committee does something for way too long. They then call you back in and tell you that you passed.

63614	0	a	Anesthesia doesn’t wear off immediately, and when you first wake up you’re pretty far out of it for a while in terms of being able to process what’s going on. It’s kind of like being drunk in terms of how you taper off. When I came off of anesthesia after oral surgery, I didn’t recognize the best friend I had taking me back home and thought he was kidnapping me at first (mind you, I didn’t make a scene or anything hysterical bc physically I just couldn’t, it was more like “who the fuck are you and why are you putting me in your truck?”) I also barely knew where anything in my apartment was 10 minutes later once I got home. It’s kind of a fun feeling, but you just don’t really process anything because your brain still thinks you’re asleep. 
63615	0	a	Depends on how much of anesthesia you’re given is my guess. When I came out of that shit I was bleeding from my mouth like it was a waterfall and didn’t feel thing until I looked down and I didn’t know who anyone was for a little bit.

63631	0	a	Kinda how I had my gay experience. I'd split up with an ex of 4 years, and was in a very dark place, my self-esteem was at an all-time low and I just felt disgusting. Went out one night and got hit on by a guy, didn't realise for like 30 mins tho. Made me feel really good about myself. Ended up going back to his and doing it. I prefer women still, but it was definitely not the worst way to end a night out, and it helped bring me back up!

63633	0	a	This reminds me of a story...   My wife and I were on our honeymoon at Universal Studios and we stopped at a bar right inside the park right when we got there so we could grab a drink. There were two middle aged guys in the bar and you could tell they had already had a few drinks, but they were good drunks (super friendly and in a great mood). Every time they took a swig one of them would look over at us and yell “take your shirt off!” which I thought was hilarious because my wife was kinda embarrassed (it wasn’t weird or creepy at all, even though that’s how it sounds. You could tell the guys were completely harmless and just goofing off) Next thing we know the bartender brings a drink over and places it in front of ME, saying it’s from that couple of guys over there. The whole time we thought they had been hollering at my wife but really they were talking to me. We ended up going over to sit right next to them at the bar and chatting for awhile while they bought us both drinks. It totally made my day though because I was super flattered and my wife couldn’t stop laughing about it as we walked out.

But he talked to me, and was saying that I was the most interesting and cutest guy in the class.  Like you know, this is kind of a relief, I have that insecurity with me everyday, where I barely talk to a girl. And he comes up and say, ""Man, with all honesty you're far being ugly, I really wonder how you don't have a girlfriend, I would totally do you.""  I replied ""You know, insecurities, confidence...""  Somehow we are friends. And he knows I am not interested. But the guy is really brilliant and pretty handsome.  EDIT fixed some mistakes.

Not everyone knows from a young age, sometimes, you have to come out *t**o yourself* before you can come out to other people.   And remember, you are not the only person in the world, you can be THE single best parent, and your child is going to have some insecurities because we are all humans.   In short, coming out to you doesn't mean you're a bad parent. And it doesn't have to be a traumatic deal, full of fear.

After a few years she made some new friends that i really didnt like and she started sharing loads of alt-right stuff on facebook and believing everything she read on there  even if i fact checked it and said it wasnt real. She slowly became more and more far right in her beliefs and started hating everyone. She became racist and homophobic to the point of going on massive rants whenever she saw a ""foreigner."" This isnt why we split, she ran off to another country for a few months to have an affair and divorced me when she came back and managed to win custody as her (rich) parents funded her lawyers to the point where i was financially unable to fight anymore. I still have my daughter for 3 days a week though. Facebook, social media and newpapers like the Daily Mail (or any rupert murdoch news with its scare tactics) changed her views on the world, same as my once-hippie parents. It was pretty horrible to see but im glad to be free of her.  Just to add: This isnt to bash on anyone with right leaning beliefs, everyone is entitled to their belifs.

It was reported that he was made to stand outside the school as a punishment for not being on time, when he saw a man with a detonator jacket entering the school. He confronted the man who then detonated his vest.  Aitzaz reportedly died on the scene and was posthumously rewarded the Sitara-e-Shujaat, a Civilian award.

63704	0	a	Once Buddha was walking from town to town with his followers. This was in the initial days. They happened to pass a lake and Buddha told one of his disciples, I am thirsty. Get me some water from that lake.  The disciple walked up to the lake and noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and he also saw a bullock cart crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple returned to tell Buddha The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.  After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him the water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.  Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be and the mud settled down on its own and you got clear water. Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen effortlessly.  Buddha says having peace of mind is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment.

63718	0	a	"> god forbid losing voters  I agree with most of this but I believe that it is a representative's responsibility to represent the people. Thus losing voters in your area means you've failed as a representative of the people because you no longer represent the will of the people.  The problem here is that the will of many is ""give me my guns and my money and fuck off"" and they are against any action to control shootings. The legislators representing these people may have the same beliefs but if we can change the will of the people we can change the will of the government. Or at least, that's the theory of democracy.  If that's untrue we have a bigger issue at hand.  Edit: lobbying money is complete bullshit, tho, I'll totally agree with that."

63724	0	a	I used to be a stripper and I had this one regular that I got very close with. Really great guy, he’s a desert storm veteran and now has a very good job, great family, and is still built like a brick shit house lol. We never did anything dirty, we’d just sit together when it was slow and drink and cuddle and talk about our lives. Once in a blue moon he’d take me for a lap dance, and even then we’d usually just cuddle and talk but I was naked now lol. This one time after we had been drinking a lot he took me for a dance and started to open up about some very private stuff related to when he served. And suddenly this huge tough guy breaks down right in front of me and just falls apart. I just hugged him and listened, telling him it’s all okay now, though from what he talked about and the haunted look in his eyes it definitely wasn’t for him. Eventually I managed to snap him out of this bad headspace and hung out with him the rest of the night, making sure to tell him often that he’s loved and everything is okay now.   We still talk and even though we have a big age difference he’s one of my closest friends ❤️  The look in his eyes in that moment though is something I’ll never forget.   EDIT: thanks for the silver and gold you guys!!

The frontman of the band spoke a lot about a former band member that passed away on Monday and about Keith Flint and told everyone there that if they are struggling with anything, there is always help and said something like 'I don't care how fucking emasculating you think it is, it's OK to talk about what's bothering you. Don't become another statistic' and everyone let out an almighty cheer. It really made me think and I had a good chat about things that were bothering me with my wife in the car on the way home.  I slept really well last night. Could've been the beer, or the 2 hours of dancing around but I know one thing, my mind felt clearer when I went to bed.

Also heard that a lot of bin men get great tips for Christmas in the UK, but that might just be in my area.   They're all normally nice cheerful guys so it's good to see them getting some love from their community.  EDIT: To all the non-English folk not familiar with the term 'dustman', please enjoy this song: https://youtu.be/Y7GeZ3YmONw  About as English as anything can get. Also maybe explains the thinking that bin men don't earn a lot.

I’m just so happy she’s doing well, and we’re having chicken and rice again because I love it!  She’ll never know what we’ve sacrificed or struggled against so she can live a good life. Nor should she. My bills aren’t her problem.   I’ll sell plasma again before she knows how close we’re burning the candle.  EDIT:  I’ve received three offers of assistance and I’m really brought to tears.  Thank you all. Please donate your time, money and resources to those who need it. It’s hard what I’m doing but I’m happy to do so.   Volunteer to tutor. Be a mentor to those in need. Donate school supplies to those who can’t afford it.  Second edit:  I’m honestly so overwhelmed right now. I don’t think I’m any better than any other parent. I’m doing the best I can with what I have, which is what we’re called to do when we make the choice to have kids.  Reddit can be an absolute cesspool.  I’ve gotten more support from this comment (that I made while taking a break from laundry) and people offering to help monetarily.  Guys if this sounded like a woe is me cash grab I’m sorry, that’s not what I meant.  If you have anything you can donate please do. Money for those that am barely afford shoes. Time. Knowledge. Your experience. Whatever you can.  And to those of you who have sent me just... such amazing messages?  You’re what we need in this world. Your parents raised a great kid and I’m proud of all of you.  Last edit I swear:   I’m reading messages and comment between rounds of go fish as journey plays in the background. (I’m getting my butt kicked!)   The struggle to raise kids is real. We’re all in this together. We’re all doing what we can with what we have. Be kid. Love each other. You don’t know what your neighbor is going through. Kindness costs nothing but is worth billions.   Be kind. Remember what Steve Irwin and Bob Ross taught us.   I love you all three thousand. And all of you are personally invited to dinner. If you’re vegetarian or vegan lemme know so I can cook something for you!

I get a discount because of my income   In the past, I could spend $100 at old navy and she’d have her uniform.   New principal. All about that upper middle class image. Plaid branded skirts. Branded polos. Branded sweaters every Friday. That’s $300.   Oddly specific supply list. Texas Instruments graphing calculator. 3 hole punched, dark blue, 6” soft pencil case. Forest green letter sized, 7 pocket poly vinyl expanding file.   There’s another $200.

63859	0	a	Two days ago I just thought I was going to have to put my dog down because she had a rare birth defect that would cause her to become paralized and no surgeon could do the operation. I spent 24 hours with her preparing to take her in to put her down. One final meal. One final trick and treat. My girlfriend was still trying to teach her new tricks the morning I had to bring her in and it just broke me. I've never felt so helpless. Then two hours before I got a phone call from my vets surgeon saying he was going to take care of the surgery that normally would have cost around $10k. I don't know man. My girl is still alive and this comic just made me break down realizing how close we had come. Fuck. Dogs are the best.

63866	0	a	He knows. 
63867	0	a	He knows. Why else would he be so happy all that time? Him making you happy makes him happy. 
63868	0	a	He totally knows. But if you want to really drive the message home then I recommend ear scritches and the occasional sausage.   My family dog loves sausages. They’re his absolute favourite and whenever he gets one (a rare treat) he looks at it with astonishment, and then carries it around in his mouth like a cigar, before burying it in his bed for later.   One night my dad was staying over and was sharing a room, but two separate (single) beds, with my mum. As she was drifting off to sleep my mum heard my dad fussing about, followed by a shriek. ‘What’s this?!’ my dad shouted, before pulling a raw sausage link out of his blankets. Upon realising it was a sausage his knee jerk reaction was to throw it (he’s a vegetarian, so extra unpleasant for him!). Unfortunately my mum happened to be his target, so after being disturbed by her shrieking partner she then had to deal with this sausage missile.   Once they’d calmed down they came to the conclusion that the dog must have got hold of the sausage and buried it in that bed, for some unknown reason.   Just as they were both about to try and go back to sleep their grandson wandered in, half asleep and rubbing his eyes   ‘Nana, there’s a sausage in my bed...’  Evidently, our little doggy likes to share ❤️
63869	0	a	Real talk I was at the vet with my cat this month and this dog I had never met before just knocked over all his mom’s shit so he could sit on my feet with his head in my lap  I doubt he knew I was super upset because my kitty friend was having a hard time, but he knew I was a friend and that I was sad... because dogs are fucking amazing  Your dog so very much knows. You’re the best of his friends.
63870	0	a	The moment I could tell my dog knows he makes me happy, was the moment he gave me a Reese's from out of the candy basket at my house (still fully wrapped, of course.) I love Reese's. They're my favorite candy, and I snack on them all the time (whenever I have them.) My dog always watches me scarf them down, and one day, after I got home from work, I walked in the door to see him wagging his tail, he ran over and grabbed a Reese's and brought it to me. He really is the best boy.
63871	0	a	Oh man remember when he has to kill the chicken for dinner and it destroys him.
63872	0	a	"> I meant,"" said Ipslore bitterly, ""what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile?"" Death thought about it. CATS, he said eventually. CATS ARE NICE.   Discworld's Death (and Discworld in general) has so many great quotes.  Edit: since this post got me checking Discworld quotes, might as well share my favorite Death quote (more like passage, it's a bit long) (unrelated to cats unfortunately)  > “All right,” said Susan. “I’m not stupid. You’re saying humans need...fantasies to make life bearable.”  > REALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.  > “Tooth fairies? Hogfathers? Little—”  > YES. AS PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE LITTLE LIES.  > “So we can believe the big ones?”  > YES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.  > “They’re not the same at all!”  > YOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET—Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.  > “Yes, but people have got to believe that, or what’s the point—”  > MY POINT EXACTLY  From Hogfather "

63890	0	a	I bet that dog knew.   My dog who passed away a few years ago always slept upstairs in my parents room. When I was in high school my appendix started to rupture in the night and I crawled up from the basement to the main floor to lay on the cold tile because it felt better. I had barely gotten upstairs and my dog was curled up beside me on the floor and didn't take his eyes off me until my parents heard me throwing up and came to see what was going on.   I don't know how he got out of my parents room or how he knew I was in pain but my dog was right there watching over me the whole time.  I don't know how they know but they always do
63891	0	a	Which book is that, I believe I have read all the Discworld books and don't remember Death have to kill a chicken?
63892	0	a	Damn, I need to reread the Discworld books. Terry Pratchett had a nearly unrivaled ability to veer from funny to profound without the tone of the book changing in the slightest. 
63893	0	a	I like that as the books progressed, and Pratchett began to realize he doesnt have much longer left, Death became more human, more compassionate, and a more welcome sight. If Anthropomorphic Personifications are a thing, then Pratchett managed to persuade enough people that Death as a person was not someone to be feared. Pratchetts Death was one last friend, one last good person before you cross over. If Death exists as a culmination of peoples beliefs as the books imply, then im sure that Pratchett had one last friend on his way out.  Not sure why. But that makes me happy.

63920	0	a	That's love right there 
63921	0	a	"I had a quite severe depression some years ago and during that period I, almost reluctantly, was dog-sitting a dog for months at a time. A black lab, and I love her. The thing is that during that depression, due to her being a dog, I had to take her out for walks. She kind of forced me to go outside, which is important in general and when you're depressed in particular. That helped me getting better. The other thing is that I could sit on my couch, apathetically with an empty stare just thinking how bad everything was and what a terrible person I was and find reasons why everyone probably hated me and why everything was completely meaningless. Because that's something you tend to do when you're depressed.  And when I was sitting there, empty and without meaning, she would come and look at me, concerned, while tilting her head. It looked like she was trying to be my therapist and figure out what was wrong with me. Then she would wag her tail for a while, and if I didn't react she'd stop, tilt her head again, start whining and nose bump my knee. Then she would sit back and look concerned again. If I looked at her, she'd start wagging her tail again, if I ignored her, she'd start whining again, until I focused at her.  What she didn't know was that she was doing exactly what was important and needed for me to get better: she broke my chains of negative thoughts, and she forced me to think of something else or be mindful and concentrate on the present. She would give me unconditional love, and I would feel better. She is a large, maybe the largest, part of my getting better again. I'm not sure that she knows that, but I've told her that, and shown her.  My point is that you shouldn't look at it as she's like ""oh noes, I've done something bad so you're sad"", but instead that she's like ""hey, something seems wrong and I want to help you and shower you with unconditional love and do anything I can so you feel better, because I love you and I have a lot of fun stuff I've planned for us, and I need you if we're going to do that, and we're going to do that, because I love you and you're a good human, yes you are, who's the best human, you are"".  She wants to help in any way she can, and she wants to help because she loves you and she's a dog and dogs are the best thing ever invented.  Don't listen to your brain. Listen to your dog. She's probably seeing this way clearer than you right now.  Also: you're worth something, and shit can get better. If you ever should trust an anonymous internet user telling you something, this is the time.  Edit: I saw the picture you posted of your dog and wanted to show my friend.

63923	0	a	"That and dogs are loyal to a fault. My dog sleeps with me and she is very protective. Once I had a girlfriend over and the next morning she tried to wake me up by shoving me with her foot (for context, she woke a bit before and was standing next to my bed. It was a friendly shove, not aggressive). I woke up but didn't want to get up yet, so she shoved me again, but this time my dog wasn't having it, so she nipped at the girlfriends foot. I had to act all upset at my dog, but I could barely hold back how proud of her I was. Of course I have trained her not to nip people anymore, but I still loved the fact she ""protected"" me from waking up"

63991	0	a	"There was a homeless guy in his 40s(?) with a big beard and in the same clothes etc, who sat by where I get breakfast on the way to work. Every morning I would get him a coffee with milk and 3 sugars and a bacon roll. He would say ""thanks, have a good day"" then I'd say ""no bother, see you tomorrow"". I didn't know his name but he always seemed happy and grateful to just get breakfast.   This became a routine for almost a year, then one day he wasn't there. Then the next, and the next. I contacted the nearby shelters to see if they knew anything but I got nothing. I started feeling genuinely scared something had happened to him so I started asking any homeless people I met if they knew anything. But without a name I wasn't getting anywhere.   A month or so went by and I had lost hope TBH, but I still went for breakfast at the same place. Then one day when it came to paying, a man stopped me and said it was on him. It took a while to register who it was, but it was my nameless homeless friend, he was in clean clothes and shaven looking better than ever. After having a chat it turns out he got a job after years of trying, on the early shift at a local factory. He had just saved enough to put a deposit down on his first rented flat. He was there to repay me for getting him breakfast all those times. I have never felt happier for someone, we still get breakfast time to time and he is doing well to this day :)"

My bus stop to take me to school on base was right next to a convenience store across the street from a line of homes facing it. Every day, at around 6-7 in the morning, I would stand out there to wait and watch a businessman get into his car to go to work.  After the first week or so he started bowing to me before he would get into his car, and I politely bowed back. Sometimes we waved to one another, but mostly we stuck to bowing.  One day, months later, it seems he was going to be gone a while, I assume a business trip of some sort. His wife came out to see him off. After he closed his door and drove away his wife turned to me and gave me a deep, formal bow.  It suddenly struck me then that he must have told her about me and the routine we shared. The fact that two (three technically) strangers could share such an emotional bond has never ceased to impact me.
63993	0	a	"I am a creature of habit. I don't like new things in an unfamiliar environment, I'm very set in where I do my shopping, that sort of thing. Every day on my way in to work I stop by the same convenience store to get a drink, a bag of chips and sometimes a peanut butter cookie from that ""Grandma's"" brand. This has been an ongoing thing since I was promoted to another department with normal working hours, probably for about the past two years. The same person is usually at the register. She's an African American woman who is often on a bluetooth headset having a conversation with someone in a language I don't understand, it sounds African, she may be an immigrant. All I really know is that even with the language barrier that whomever she is speaking to is someone she cares deeply for with all of her soul.   Anyway, I took vacation last year. Vacation for me is a week of not leaving my home, playing with my cat, getting some cleaning done and probably playing a crap ton of video games. I came back the next week and when I got to the register I found myself being chastised because she did not see me all last week.  I was very taken back, and it was a feeling that I'm not used to experiencing. I don't think a lot of myself, in fact I think incredibly poorly of myself and in general consider myself a bad person for the thoughts I have sometimes. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder if my mother and others would be better off just having the insurance money from my death. It was.. foreign to me that someone noticed I wasn't around. I've often assumed that if I died in my sleep it would be a couple of days before someone realized something had happened to me.   But no... the kind woman with her bluetooth headset, who always has my items bagged by the time I've swiped my card, notices it if I don't come in at my usual time. And what's funny is that when she isn't there I find myself annoyed with whomever is at the register because I have to ask them to do things she just does as part of her job to make her day better for her customers. I couldn't tell you anything about her other than that she has a genuinely kind smile and has very lively conversations in a language I can't understand with someone whom she loves very much and that somehow this person telling me to have a good day makes me feel like any other person in the world: the people I find myself wishing I was."
63994	0	a	I work at a gas station and it’s amazing. All of the morning regulars know each other just from coming into the gas station for coffee and cigarettes in the morning. They chat while they make their coffees and tell each other to have a good one before they leave. Sometimes they even buy each other’s coffee or pop. They don’t know each other from anywhere else but the gas station. It’s wonderful. Mornings are my favorite parts of working midnights.

63996	0	a	I have a commute buddy. He’s a big gay man who I stand next to. We have never said a word to each other, but we’ll always smile at each other when we see each other around the small city where we work, and we time our getting up and going to the train in the mornings.   It’s a weirdly nice part of my day. He doesn’t work on Mondays though which makes me feel a bit lonely but he always comes back. 
63997	0	a	When I was working one of my first jobs in my early 20s I used to have this fairly long commute including a 40 minute train journey.   There was this cute girl probably around my age who I always ended up sitting across from every day. For me, at least, it wasn't even like I was deliberately sitting across from her; it was just that the train was still fairly empty where I got on so I had a choice and I liked to sit in one particular carriage and seat for reasons of convenience when getting off and legroom comfort. She was definitely cute and I would sneak looks at her, though.  One day after several months (so we definitely both recognised each other, even if we'd never spoken) I happened to be looking out the window and caught her eye when she looked up as I was turning back round. She gave me this really sweet, friendly, big, familiar smile. I immediately panicked, stared down at my book with a blank expression, and was careful to never make eye contact again until I moved jobs and started getting a different train.  I'm in my mid 30s now. I'm thoroughly well adjusted. I have a partner who I live with, love more than anything, and want to spend my life with. But I still sometimes think of that moment, cringe, and wonder what might have happened if I'd smiled back.  Edit: oh one more thing. I remember her looking sad as I frantically broke eye contact to stare at my book. Hahahaha. Jesus fuck 18-25 year old me.
63998	0	a	I used to take the train to my very early job and sometimes I’d fall asleep on my way. I always sat in the same place and a woman who didn’t speak English always sat in the same place across from me. Without fail, every day that I fell asleep she would wake me up at my stop. We never spoke otherwise but I always felt like she was my friend. 
63999	0	a	There is this one regular I see on my commute almost every day. Every time we see each other it’s always sneaky eye contact. Like looking at each other but not actually acknowledging each other.  I feel like too awkward to say anything now so whenever it happens I start laughing to myself so I look like an even crazier person so yeah.
64000	0	a	I always go to this little coffee/doughnut shop right next to where I do laundry to get coffee and change. I was behind on laundry one week, and when I finally got around to doing it, this sweet old Chinese lady behind the counter who I had hardly spoken to, asked me where I had been. Now we have full conversations every week and she gives me life advice

64002	0	a	"I used to have a bus ride like this. There was this nice dude and his daughter that would share most of the same route and time (he'd get off a few stops earlier and drop his daughter off at preschool then continue to roughly where I worked, too). We'd make a bit of small talk from time-to-time.  One week I had to go in early and so we rode at different times. When I resumed my regular schedule he explained that's it's common in Chinese culture for children to refer to parents' friends as ""Uncle"" regardless biological relationships and when I was not on the bus after a few days she asked her Dad ""where's uncle?""."

64006	0	a	This reminds me of a group I used to see on my way to drop my son off at daycare. Every morning I’d see two older woman walking arm in arm while two older men walked side by side behind them. They’d all be laughing and chatting and were out even on cold or rainy days. I always noticed how happy they looked.  And then one day the two men and one women were walking three abreast down the sidewalk, clinging desperately onto one another and sobbing as they walked slowly down the street.  The three of them continued their walking routine for as long as we lived there, but I never saw them again without feeling a pang of sorrow.
64007	0	a	I have a very similar story that happened last night. I have a Korean-Canadian parking neighbour at my building and there is a bit of a language barrier so we never really said much to each other. Seems like a normal dude, never any issues with him just never had a reason to talk to him. Last night I came home and someone was parked in my spot with their car on (probably waiting for someone) and my parking neighbour was out at their window telling them to move, its not their spot. I pulled up as they were pulling away and after i thanked him he said that he thought i got a new car but when he saw it wasnt me he asked them to move.   Such a small gesture but it really meant a lot to me. Its kind of unexplainable but I love the unspoken connections formed with people. Same thing when youre driving on the highway with the same group of cars for a while  Edit: fixed some grammar and changed Korean to Korean-Canadian
64008	0	a	I have about a half dozen people I regularly see at my home station or who get off at the same part of the platform in the city as me. I don't know their names. We don't talk. But they are my people. And if something ever goes down, I'll go to war for them.

64010	0	a	I had tons of these when I lived downtown in a large urban center. This one dude and I had almost the exact same sleep schedule and our dogs had synchronized bladders. Almost every night I’d be across the street with my dog and I’d look up and he’d be kitty corner away from me with his corgi.  Our dogs, always and without fail, would scream at each other, but for whatever reason he and I never interacted. We’d kind of exchange sheepish looks while our dogs barked their faces off, and then we’d each haul them away in opposite directions.  The song and dance went on for almost two years, and then I moved. I hope he’s well. 
64011	0	a	I moved to my first apartment about 3 years ago. Everyday before work, I drive to the gas station across the street and this older gentleman would be there either gassing up his corvette or wiping it down. We’d never say hi, how are you, or anything for that matter. I noticed him every day and still do to this day. It’ll be pretty sad when we no longer “greet” each other in the mornings. 
64012	0	a	I used to see a girl every day outside of a library for a few years, never spoke to her, then my family moved away. Few years later I get to high school and sit next to a girl, start talking to her, become best friends, and she mentioned how close we could have been if we made friends those years back. I never made the connection until then, and it was amazing. She said she missed me when I disappeared, and I thought of her sometimes.

64014	0	a	When I was in high school working at a Piggly Wiggly, an older couple opened a little bistro restaurant. I'd go over there on my breaks and they always treated me like a son. Then they were just closed up and gone one day. Met the man a few years later and his wife caught cancer and died, then he moved. He told me that she always looked forward to when i come over for a burger and told her friends about me. Really good people, i didnt even realize i had that kind of impact on them

64017	0	a	Yes! On longer interstate trips I’ve rolled down the window and waved goodbye to a few ‘buddies’ while exiting the highway. Usually for those that I could tell wanted a buddy too; traveling the same speed, leaving room when both changing lanes and overall respect while driving together.   I like to think the farewell meant something to them too :)
64018	0	a	I left Jacksonville, FL one day on I-10 and just fell in with a line of 8-10 cars doing a little over 90mph.  I figured there was safety in numbers and followed along....for over 200 miles.  We passed two state troopers that I saw who didn't move.  When I turned off in Marianna after a couple of hours the two cars in front of me and the one behind me all waved.  It was just one of those passing, magical little moments that makes life entertaining.
64019	0	a	For ten years I would wave at this old man that lived at the end of my street. Mostly when we were taking our trash out to the curb (which happened with an odd degree of synchronicity over the years) or when I saw him mowing the lawn and I was walking my dog. I could have drawn a picture of the guy I knew his face so well, but I never stopped to chat with him or even learned his name.  One day I noticed his trash can was still at the curb two days after trash pickup. I went down, took it up to the side of the garage, and then knocked on the door to check in on him. An old woman answered and I asked if the man was OK because it was the first time I'd seen the can left out at the curb in all the years I'd lived down the street. It turns out he'd passed away the week before and, to say the least, her routine was a little bit off.   That was years ago and I still walk down the street every week to take the trash out and mow the lawn in his stead. Over cups of tea with his wife and dinners at our home I've learned his name was Gerald, he was a Korean War veteran, and he took a lot of pride in his lawn and his flower garden.   Anyways, I guess the point is... take time now and then to meet your perfect strangers.

64023	0	a	I live in FL & work at a restaurant.. we used to have this homeless man, Gregory, come in every day and order a soda and just sit at the bar and watch tv for hours, to escape the heat. It’s so damn hot so we didn’t blame him, and didn’t mind either. He always kept to himself. He had a couple bags that he would drop off at the host stand and we would make sure no one touched them. It became so routine we would just comp a dish and his soda for him every day. Then we were (indirectly) hit by a hurricane last season, and everyone had to evacuate. No one saw him after that. We were all really worried and decided to raise money so that if he did come back, he would have a little financial cushion.   Well he never made his way back.. and I thought of him very often and worried about him. My late brother was homeless for a while at the peak of his mental illness, and Gregory reminded me a lot of him. I was scared something happened to Greg as it’s a very hard life.   Until a few weeks ago. I’ve been going through a hard time and heartbreak so I’ve been seeing a therapist. Her office is on the opposite side of town, an area I typically wouldn’t visit, but it was the only practice I could get in. Well, I was ubering the 40 minutes home and as I was sitting in the back seat starring out the window thinking about life, we came to a stop at a light. Who do I see sitting at the bus stop? Gregory.   I couldn’t help but smile really big. Maybe his circumstances haven’t dramatically changed, it seemed like he’s still living on the streets... but he’s safe.

64027	0	a	Hey. I know how you feel. Brutal feeling for sure. People do care though. Life is just busy.   I had a total implosion from this feeling once. I was like 6 months single out of an 8 year relationship, and in a city where literally all of my friends I hung out with regularly were her family members (brothers, cousins), so I was suddenly just alone. They still loved me or whatever but it was awkward so we just cut ties.    I was finishing my degree, so I just did math all day, and worked in a kitchen all night. I had supported her through her school, and she was supposed to do the same for me, but that didn’t happen. As a consequence I didn’t really have time to branch out socially while finishing my degree, as I had to work to put myself through school. Outside of work talk in the kitchen the only people I spoke to were bus drivers, baristas, and the girl who scanned my pass at my gym every day. I wasn’t really conscious of this though I was just going through the motions.   One day while doing math alone in my room I had this crazy moment that came totally out of nowhere. I mean I was so focused on my school work I wasn’t thinking about my life at all, but my brain suddenly on its own switched gears completely and I realized all at once I couldn’t remember the last time someone was happy to see me. I just felt this deep aching loneliness and broke down crying. It was so weird I didn’t know all that empty was there until then. It showed me how important a social life can be for people. I didn’t realize it until I felt it’s absence, but I think a feeling of belonging in a intimate community, like a tribe, is deeply important to a healthy and fulfilling life.

64034	0	a	I can be socially awkward/anxious, but sometimes will just think fuck it, what do I have to lose, and interact with that person. And have always felt better for doing it, no matter what the outcome.
64035	0	a	I think it's just a way of giving him a little life while showing they know nothing about him because they haven't spoken. It doesn't matter if you then imagine him looking like Gandhi, Geronimo, or an old Indian friend of yours, he has a face now and is a little more of a person to you. For some people he might speak in an accent, although he didn't to me.

64041	0	a	"Similar thing happened to me. The owner of a 7-11/gas station right near my house is a really awesome guy. Many years ago I asked if he knew about Lime/Cucumber Gatorade as I tried it a year prior when I was training in Texas. It was instantly my favorite and I could not find it ANYWHERE in my area.  The owner said he never heard of it, but he'll look it up. The next day he was so excited when he told me that he contacted his Pepsi distributor who said they will start shipping it to him the very next week.   Well that next week he had it stocked and I was super happy and he had a huge smile.  I always made a stop at that 7-11 almost every other day for a few years just to get that Gatorade and sometimes some snacks and to see the owner. We always were happy to see each other.  Well at one point in my career, I switched schedules to a much earlier shift. The route I used to take which would have me drive right by this 7-11 used to be a fair amount quicker during rush hour, but now during my earlier shift, it's actually much longer. I decided to take a different, more direct route to work and it turned out to be about 20 mins quicker because it was pretty much a straight line down the main highway. I ended up taking that route regularly which meant I'd not go to the same 7-11 anymore. I'd end up going to a different 7-11 which was along my new route, however they did not have the Lime/Cucumber Gatorade, and I never bothered to ask because it wouldn't be as special as before.  Well a couple months after, I REALLY wanted some Lime/Cucumber Gatorade and since that was pretty much the only 7-11 in the entire area which had it (apparently it's not very popular in the DC area), I made a stop to that 7-11.  The owner was like, ""Where have you been? I've missed you!"" and my heart melted. We reconnected and I bought the Gatorade and told him I'd be back more often, which I am a bit more, but usually on the way home when he's less likely to be in. I think I'll pay him a trip on Monday."
64042	0	a	It’s really interesting because you don’t know what anyone else is truly feeling and just a simple smile or wave can really change someone’s life. Whether you ever go talk to him or not, I’d bet the impact is there.

64097	0	a	I didn't realize until a couple years ago how lucky I am that my dad is still alive  and well at 62. Though last year his doc did tell him that if he didn't live healthier he was at risk of developing diabetes. So he went from drinking a few beers every night and eating a robust diet of hamburgers and hotdogs, and never working out for 15 years, to drinking only a couple days a week, eating exclusively poultry and veggies, and running every other day. Also this fucker, on his first run in 15 years, ran 3 miles in half an hour, which ain't bad for a guy over 60.

64109	0	a	While it is sad that Steve Irwin is dead, I think there is something to celebrate. Steve Irwin's death was a fairly long time ago now, yet the impact of it on everyone has honestly seemed to stay the same. It goes to show the legacy he left behind, while Steve himself is dead, his memory truly does live on with everyone remembering him so fondly.
64110	0	a	you beautiful person

64117	0	a	Same
64118	0	a	Exactly! I mean, look at how many people came out to defend him when PETA made their comment the other day. People defended this man simply because he was a wholesome person with a heart of gold.  His death left behind a legacy that we all have to move forward with. He was an inspiration to us all, and changing that might not have left us with the same effect.

He developed his quick-painting technique to create art for sale during brief daily work breaks. Having held military positions that required him to be, in his own words, ""tough"" and ""mean"", ""the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work"", Ross decided that if he ever left the military, he would never yell or raise his voice again."

64156	0	a	My 2018 is going to be infinitely better than 2017. I've been struggling with my health for about 1.5 years and yesterday I figured out why.  Apparently I don't absorb vitamin B12 from my food so my storage was depleted (it lasts 5 years, it's been about 6 or 7 years since I last had injections because of a vitamin B12 deficiency). I got a shot of vitamin B12 this morning (8 or 9 hours ago) and I already started feeling better. After being sick for 9 weeks straight, it's amazing.  I'll finally have energy to do more fun stuff again. I'll be able to concentrate better, my hypermobility will bother me less (this deficiency can also cause joint issues). It's going to be an amazing year with amazing friends here, on discord and at school!

64237	0	a	Word of advice from a fellow socially awkward (at times) regular schmoe. It's ok to get rejected, learn to accept and be cool with it. Not everyone will like you back that way and that's just you accepting reality. By accepting it, it stops being something that will feel like the end of the world. I practice by talking to people I'm dealing with, like waiters, baristas, bartenders, stylists. You get used to the flow of conversation and coming up with stuff on the spot. You get used to it and better at it. You realize it's easier to talk to people in general (even ones you're attracted to) without being so awkward about it. And you realize looks only go so far. An average looking person who is confident, can make others laugh and feel good just by talking to them are way more successful, not just with scoring but with people getting in their corner.

64287	0	a	Brandon Stanton’s Humans Of New York is truly inspirational and keeps me going everyday. There’s so many more interviews he does with people of all ages and outside of New York.  Besides the website, he’s also on Instagram and Twitter. And there’s a Facebook Watch series of this. I highly recommend everyone to check it out!

64291	0	a	"The phrase ""and those who can't X teach"" drives me nuts.   There are a multitude of things that I can do that I cannot teach to someone else. The ability to distill your knowledge down to the simplest building blocks and be able to rearrange those blocks in many different ways so everyone is able to build with them is an absolutely incredible skill.

For example,  a 50 year old whose body is tired and older, who can't compete with 20 year olds, who once had great skills, now can't ""do"" so that's why they ""teach ""?

Well, My friend just had a cat die yesterday and she told me she ESPECIALLY needed all the wholesome memes today. This is literally perfect. It’s so strange how pieces of life come at the right time, just when you need them.

64306	0	a	Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....   Edit: thank you for the gold kind stranger.

64311	0	a	Omg that is just what I needed today too.  I had to put my eldest dog down last Thursday and it's been rough, needless to say.  We got his ashes back this week and I just got an urn necklace today, so I have him next to my heart at all times.

64314	0	a	We had to put down our 14 year old dog two years ago before Christmas, we have his ashes in the living room safe where he can be admire by the whole family. It is rough thinking about not having him no more, but we spoiled him ever since adoption making sure he was happy every single day. 
64315	0	a	Opening my eyes, I got to my feet. I was surprised that my paws weren’t hurting. I wagged my tail and sniffed the air. It smelled like The Park and Our Home. It smelled good here, I liked it a lot.   Yesterday I wasn’t feeling so good. I had been throwing up and my hips and paws hurt. Even eating grass didn’t help. My Person had brought me to the Sharp place. I tried to be mad at him, but he seemed really sad about something, so I wagged my tail to try and cheer him up. I didn’t even notice when the [Sharp Man](https://streamable.com/og0ed)  poked me, as My Person had been rubbing me and saying Good Boy. I never knew what Good Boy meant, but saying it made My Person happy, so I tried to make him say it often. After that, my eyes got heavy and then I couldn’t remember anything.   I take a look around. There are two paths in front of me. Both go far off into the distance. One is dark and filled with scary things and gives me bad feelings. The other goes to a bright place. There is grass everywhere and lots of other dogs playing around. It felt so welcoming, I took a few steps forward, preparing to head in that direction. That was, until I noticed a small spot of light in the dark place. Looking down, I saw Our Home. My Person was sitting on the Forbidden Chair looking sad. He looked over at the Okay Bed, where I was allowed to sit, and he would shake a bit and his breath would stifle, because he was sad. I made my choice.   I walked into the dark place. I sat there in front of the small window looking into Our Home. There were a lot of scary, evil smelling things around My Person, but he didn’t seem to notice. He was still looking at the Okay Bed, but his eyes seemed, unfocused and foggy. I try really hard and force myself through the small window, causing me to fall into Our Home. I glanced back and saw that the small window closed behind me. I slowly walk up to My Person. I try to nudge him, but my nose went through his hand. He didn’t notice me, but the Bad Things noticed him. All around us, they were creeping closer, but when they got to me, the Bad Things stopped. It seemed that they couldn’t move past me. They slowly retreated, fading back into the background.   I sat there, next to My Person. Weeks, months, and many years went by. He never noticed me, but he would often sit on the Forbidden Chair, next to me, looking at the Okay Bed, and whispering softly…Good Boy.
64316	0	a	So since I can only assume this total onslaught of Keanu Reeves content on all social media right now is part of a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at boosting his popularity, let me be clear that I fully support Keanu Reeves for President in 2020.
64317	0	a	I didn’t know about his stillborn child nor about his gf. I did know about River Phoenix. He’s remarkable to go through all of this tragedy in the public eye and react in a positive way. It makes me think my personal tragedies are tiny in comparison. He is breathtaking.
64318	0	a	He is not the hero reddit deserves , he is the hero reddit needs
64319	0	a	Wow he's been through so much pain and yet so humble and kind hearted.
64320	0	a	You are not alone keanu. We all are here and love you wholeheartedly.
64321	0	a	Can we stop parading around the tragedies of the man's life for Karma. As much as it's supposed to be a celebration of him it feels disingenuous, and I'm sure he'd rather move past those than see them plastered next to his face every day on the internet.
64322	0	a	I had thought the matrix money he donated was going to the special effects artists because he felt they weren't appropriately compensated and were the major reason the film was so good. Could very well be wrong, just thought I read that somewhere before.   I know he does have a charity he sponsors though.
64323	0	a	It seems really shitty to constantly bring up the shittier points in his life when referring to the guy.
64324	0	a	2020 final candidates:  (D) Keanu Reeves  (R) Kanye West
64325	0	a	I’d never want a President Reeves. I have no idea what his politics are, but the inherent controversy that *any* president faces by nature of “they make world-changing decisions that someone will always disagree with” would seriously get in the way of his wholesome image that he’s spent so long cultivating
64326	0	a	Well he and his girlfriend had already broken up when she died two years after their daughter was stillborn, but it's indeed a tragedy.
64327	0	a	He has got the attention of most of the internet right now, He’s been changing the world and we don’t even know it. Hopefully he can now do more.
64328	0	a	He’s not jaded. That’s the key difference. People wanna martyr themselves for every little adversity instead of pushing through it. He could have easily given up at any of these but didn’t.
64329	0	a	I don’t know how many other people could come out so successful and inspirational with his background story. Many of us would give up.
64330	0	a	I'm pretty sure you're right, he thought they deserved better pay for the work they did.
64331	0	a	I actually want this, not for the politics of it.  But for the story.
64332	0	a	Thanks for clarifying. This all happened 20 years ago. It is horrible and it is a tragedy but I don’t think Keanu wants us to feel bad for him and I don’t think he’s lonely. Judging from the Cyberpunk video I think he wants us to be stoked with life! He does awesome movies, he gets to learn new stuff, he started a motorcycle company that he loves, he gets to travel, he gets to donate to charities that are meaningful. He has wonderful friends and supportive family. If that’s not a happy life I don’t know what is!
64333	0	a	> right now  Actually, this has been well known, and he has had the internet's attention for a decade now.
64334	0	a	A much better story than Bran the Broken

64337	0	a	Nothing compared to right now though. Not even close
64338	0	a	I don't know if there is one correct answer, but for me it is showing empathy and kindness.  Once you realize that other people suffer, continue to suffer and perhaps suffer more than you, and that by showing them kindness and support you can help them, not only do you make their life better, but you improve your own.  Making someone else feel loved does wonders for yourself.  Then, when you don't expect it, and you are having a rough go, others will be there for you.
64339	0	a	Fucking little shit got a throne for doing shit all. I'm still not over it.
64340	0	a	Very true. It's been niche fandom for a looooong time. I'm glad the gen pop is learning how inspiring he is and what a *truly* decent and exceptional human being he is.
64341	0	a	Same.  After he explicitly stated that as the 3 eyed raven he could never be in a position of power.  I'm gonna die mad about it.

64344	0	a	After googling Matilda and looking at Mara Wilson’s (Matilda) Wikipedia page, I have come to find out that Ben Shapiro is her cousin. What.
64345	0	a	Danny Devito was Matilda’s father in the movie. I was mindblown when I figured that out.
64346	0	a	Aaand was one of the productors for Pulp Fiction
64347	0	a	Didn't wake up thinking that a post about Danny Devito would get me choked up today, but here we are.
64348	0	a	[Danny Devito is a wholesome dude. Check out the top comment on this tread.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/6vpvoe/til_during_the_filming_of_matilda_danny_devito/dm32bh7/?context=1)
64349	0	a	He also plays Frank Reynolds in IASIP and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s sibling in Twins — on which they made A LOT of money.
64350	0	a	Danny DeVito *is* a national treasure.
64351	0	a	It was slightly jarring that he was the narrator and a major antagonist. Because the narrator was quite kind with respect to Matilda, while the father was decidedly not.
64352	0	a	They do not get along
64353	0	a	I follow her on twitter because Natalie Wynn and a bunch of other prominent left figures follow her. I’m ashamed to say I had no idea she was the kid in Matilda until she tweeted about it(I’ve never seen the movie). I’ve always just known her as the left lady who’s got great takes lol  Edit: I knew she was Ben Shapiro’s cousin before I knew of her acting career wtf is that lol
64354	0	a	Rhea Perlman (Danny Devito's wife) was the mother in the movie as well.   And I mention that because she deserves credit too: Mara lived with her in her house as well (being that Danny Devito is her husband).
64355	0	a	This is something I'm not getting about the post and your comment.  How could you not know that if you've seen the movie?  He's a pretty distinctive actor.
64356	0	a	So he directed a kid's movie that teaches positive values, as well as being widely regarded as one of the best children's films of all time, and another where a rapist gets his balls blown off with a shotgun.
64357	0	a	I remember watching the movie and thought he was an asshole irl.   I now feel like an asshole for assuming this. Danny DeVito is a treasure.
64358	0	a	Exactly thought about this comment. Crazy how Schwarzenegger managed to run into it and help.
64359	0	a	I can’t imagine why
64360	0	a	"Hahaha just looked up her twitter account and the name is ""Mara 'get rid of the Nazis' Wilson"". Yeah I'll bet.  EDIT: Ben Shapiro is not a Nazi.

64361	0	a	She was also the little girl in Mrs. Doubtfire!
64362	0	a	I read that as Ron Perlman and was very, very confused.
64363	0	a	How weird must it have been to work opposite two repulsive parent characters and then go “home” with them where I’m sure they were lovely.
64364	0	a	I went through that too, though! My explanation is that I saw the movie a million times when I was a kid, and didn't know who Danny DeVito was. Later on I knew Danny as the dad from Matilda, and eventually as he became more of a legend/meme, I forgot where I knew him originally from. I haven't seen Matilda in over a decade, but still love it. So later on when I learned/remembered it was Danny, it blew my mind.
64365	0	a	I feel the rapist getting his balls blown off is teaching children positive values.
64366	0	a	To be fair, he plays a lot of assholes.  A testament to his acting ability.
64367	0	a	He always seems to be there when you need a post sent to Danny Devito, or when you need the liquid terminator killed
64368	0	a	Her mom got cancer because he DESTROYED her with FACTS and LOGIC.
64369	0	a	Mara won't send Shapiro photos of AOC's feet.
64370	0	a	Come on man, that's a little over the top  *checks*  What do you know, it really is.
64371	0	a	He speaks against them while also blowing the racist dog-whistle. He's a racist.
64372	0	a	ron perlman and danny devito would be one hell of a power couple
64373	0	a	It's his release so he can be wholesome af off-camera.
64374	0	a	Frank Reynolds is a Saint
64375	0	a	What did Logic do? Spit bars at her?
64376	0	a	Not enough magnum condoms for monster dongs to fuel that.
64377	0	a	That's the best part, Ben Shapiro doesn't actually know Logic, but he pretends to
64378	0	a	> Ben Shapiro  my beloved nephew, just started college, likes this guy.  so far i keep my mouth shut as i do not want to alienate him and have him go over completely to the dark side.
64379	0	a	I haven't seen anything about Ben in a long time, why does everyone here seem to hate him?
64380	0	a	He doesn't argue so much as he espouses so many different views/topics in one single breath that those inexperienced with debate don't know how to handle all the information flying at them and perform poorly.
64381	0	a	As others are suggesting, he's good at debating *like a Republican,* which means yelling, interrupting, and Gish Galloping. He only engages with lesser debators, like college students. He doesn't actually debate the greater liberal political minds, so this selective debating makes him appear smart and capable, while he is in fact like a mediocre NCAA player who pretends he's a pro on social media.   There's a video of him being interviewed by a well known and intelligent british conservative. Shapiro didn't know that last bit and accused him of being a liberal for being critical and analytical about his views. The British guy embarrassed the shit out of him, and serves as a great example of how shitty Ben actually is.  Throw in the radical right views he has and presto, human garbage.
64382	0	a	He doesn't always think things through. Such as his stance on [climate change.](https://youtu.be/X9FGRkqUdf8)    [^^^HBomberguy ^^^source.](https://youtu.be/RLqXkYrdmjY)
64383	0	a	"Pretty sure ""sophistry"" is an apt description of his style."
64384	0	a	Waitressing, I once had two drunk customers hitting on me relentlessly while I was trying to put in orders, I told them to fuck off with out thinking. I relate to this too hard.
64385	0	a	This isn't restaurant related but I just spent several days in the hospital and it amazed me how poorly everyone was treating the nurses. I just couldn't understand it, these people are trying to help you and they're just yelling and cursing at them. I felt bad for the staff.
64386	0	a	I never insult the staff anywhere. They’re the employees and I don’t know what they’ve been through. They deserve to be treated nicely.
64387	0	a	I got upset at a lady at the ups store because I was doing a return and the company had printed the return label for me but only gave me one when I needed two. Was frustrated and took it out on her. I think I was just having a crappy day on the whole.  I felt terrible, I ended up going back in and apologizing to her
64388	0	a	Honestly, I think you shouldn't abuse robots either. If I was on a date and they were cruel to any sort of sentient or non-sentient server that would be a total red flag for me...
64389	0	a	Man fuck people who try to take advantage of workers who could very well lose their job just for sticking up for themselves. And kudos to you for actually doing something to these ass hats. How did your manager respond?
64390	0	a	If I were your manager I would have had your back.
64391	0	a	Most of the times the people who are treating the nurses disrespectfully is in some sort of stress, physical or emotional pain. They are not thinking or acting on the correct mind set.   Think about it when you are stressed even the slightest thing could irritate you.
64392	0	a	  Imagine getting underpayed and overworked. Thats how these employees are mostly treated. The least thing you could do is be nice to them.
64393	0	a	I couldn’t believe I said it when I did, the two guys looked shocked and started laughing and were like Hey “we won’t tell your manager okay” then started making jokes about how if I was in the USA (it was in Australia, I’m from the USA)” you would be fired” and then just kept saying how they won’t say anything. Then soon after I saw them walk up and tell my manager. One manager (my favorite manager) was Not happy and just couldn’t believe I said that and was like “why would you do that.” Then he big manager (owner) pulled me aside to get all the info, I was Totally honest and at the end of the day he (and basically every other person that worked there) understood and had my back. But obviously he told me to just not do it again.
64394	0	a	I've had friends that worked as waitresses, and just thinking about the shit they had to put up with makes me fucking **livid**. One of the worst things I heard was that they would often not be allowed a single bathroom break during 8+ hour shifts. Some of their coworkers would get kidney stones from waitressing. Its straight up inhumane. My heart goes out to waiters/waitresses.  Edit: I didn't think this comment would get any attention, but since it has, I'd like to say this. Just because this stuff hasn't happened to you or someone you know, doesn't mean that it isn't happening to someone, somewhere. Skepticism is perfectly fine, but in this case there is zero detriment to you or anyone else to put aside your skepticism and consider that what I have said may be true. There's no chance of anything getting better if people are in the dark about it. At the very least, please, please be kind to folks in the service industry. If you know someone with a job like that, perhaps check up on them and see how they're doing. Even if you can't do anything for them directly, just knowing that you care can go a long way!
64395	0	a	I thought about that as well, and one guy had a legitimate reason to be upset. His surgery had been cancelled for the 4th time in a row and he was none too happy. The nurse explained that there was nothing she could do about it but he still yelled at her. I understand he was stressed but she didn't deserve that.
64396	0	a	Wow, they said they wouldn't tell and then went and told anyway. Exactly the sort of behavior I'd expect from two limp-dicked idiots hitting on someone who is just trying to do their job.
64397	0	a	Wow. That’s just fucking slave labor. No job is worth that abuse, I hope they have healthier job environments now.
64398	0	a	Here’s a fun fact, someone who makes a big deal about “Not telling” and tries to be buddy-buddy about not telling, they should not be trusted.

Their thai peppers are imported from relatives who grow them, so the spiciness varies depending on the harvest. There's a 0-5 spicy scale when ordering and a markerboard with, ""NO REFUND IF TOO SPICY"" written on it.    The girl running the register, I believe the daughter of the owners (and the only native English speaker), is so small she wears children's  Disney shirts and I can't help but be jealous she can do that. I compliment her on the shirts and give her a hard time when she doesn't have a Disney character on her shirt for the day.

As he’s getting them he verified that I don’t want anything on them and I confirm. He looked pleased. Then he asked if they were both for me and I said yes. He looked up mid prep and said in a thick New York accent “Alright! I like a woman that can eat and you’re eatin’ ‘em right!” Then he gave me a bag of chips and a drink and sent me on my way. Nice to have someone say that when I came in.

I was backstage carrying my sousaphone, and an old man pointed to me, made a muscle, and said in a thick Russian accent, “Strong! Like Russian Women!” This was many years ago, and I still remember his smiling eyes as he said it.

64434	0	a	People always say Parisians are rude/don't like tourists, but I was helped to lug two heavy bags from my year abroad down the subway steps on my way to the airport to fly home.  Also, earlier when I had been catching the train from Switzerland back to Paris, a load of what looked like new conscripts for their army loaded onto the train, taking up all the aisle room.  I was on the top level and when I had to get off, there was no easy way through the crush. One young gent yelled out and got one other to hoik my bags over their heads and take them along the aisle, down the stairs and onto the platform for me.  They all looked very smashing in their new uniforms and I felt very flattered haha.

64443	0	a	I love when foreigners don’t quite know the word for something but find a great way of expressing it lol. Reminds me of a time a few years ago; I used to work as security for a retail store in a big outlet centre which sees a lot of tourists visit regularly.   Once an Arab guy came in to the store where I was working and, as I was the first person he saw, decided to ask me for help.   “My friend, please, I am looking for uhhh... how do you say... shorts, but with sleeves, yes? Shorts with sleeves.”  He was motioning towards his legs as he spoke and obviously meant trousers. I thought it was just...fantastic. I showed him where they were and I always smile when I think back about it (although I obviously didn’t laugh at the time, so as to not seem rude lol).

64516	0	a	People are confusing introversion with being shy/socially anxious.   I'm an introvert. I'll talk to anyone and I'll be a social butterfly at gatherings/parties and often host. But I also do just fine sitting at home reading a book or working on projects. After a big night out I usually need a morning to mentally recharge and don't want to be around people at that time. I don't like group vacations for that reason: I'm socially outgoing but I also need my alone time.  OTOH, I have a friend who is an extrovert. He *needs* to be around other people. He makes far too much money to need a roommate, but he has one because he needs the constant social interaction. He leaves his door unlocked whenever he's at home and always has at least a couple of people over.

64528	0	a	Yeah you would be surprised. Talk to classmates, share homework details and study groups if you need something to break the ice.
64529	0	a	Introvert LPT: just ask the person what profession they’re studying for.  Once they stop, just ask a question about it.  Once they stop, ask another question.  Once that well runs dry, ask about their hobby.  Once they finish talking about it, ask a question related to what they said.  Rinse and repeat.  Try to read the room, though.  If they don’t feel like talking about it, just nod, say “neat,” and play it cool by acting like the awkward silence is totally normal.  Keeping a drink in your hand to take sips from is a great prop to make it seem like you have a reason for not talking much but you still want to hang out with others - it’s because you’re thirsty.  This way you can be sociable without having to talk.

64539	0	a	The second picture is so sweet.  Edit to add: would he be able to qualify for a volunteer program at a nearby hospital to hold babies in the nicu?
64540	0	a	As a sib of a brother who has Down syndrome, the word “Downsie” drives me nuts. I can’t get past it in the meme. Especially combined with low functioning. Just describe the behavior you need to make people understand he can’t hold babies.   Sorry, end rant, this guy and the baby are amazing ❤️ my brother loves hugging on babies.
64541	0	a	My best friend has downs and she is by far the most loving, incredible person on this entire earth. They are wonderful, kind, beautiful people who see the good in everyone. We are so lucky to have them in our lives.
64542	0	a	Yeah, I'm not sure what causes that. I'm autistic myself and I get the same thing. Kids trust me; animals see me as not-a-threat. Luckily I rather like both children and animals, so I don't get annoyed the way your brother most likely does.  My best guess is this: Autistics like me and your bro usually have a neutral expression on our faces and bodies. We aren't constantly trying to interact, shoving ourselves into other people's lives. We just exist and experience the world around us. So when a small person, or an animal, sees that, they see us as someone who won't attack them or try to dominate them. Cats, especially, see us as very polite because we don't impose ourselves on them. So we're sort of a safe person.  When it comes to actually interacting with kids, I tend to forget they're kids and just talk to them like I would to anyone. Some kids may like that because they feel like I know they are also human and take them seriously. I never saw the point in not taking kids seriously, really; I was perfectly serious about life myself when I was a kid, after all.     Edit: Just wanted to say thanks for the medals! You all made my day! Love to all my autistic sibs out there.

64549	0	a	High function can mostly take care of themselves and even hold a job with simple requirements.    Low function can't do those things or at least they need much more supervision than a high functioning.
64550	0	a	My sister has mosaic Down’s Syndrome, which means only some of her cells have trisomy 21 and she doesn’t exhibit all the typical traits (eg appearance).

I think if she had been brought up with independence as a goal, she could have lived on  her own and maybe had a job. That’s the high end. Kids with special needs receive tons of assessments, so I’m sure that’s where it comes up.

Autistic AF and lucked out with a savant skill of near-perfect visual-spatial abilities; designed kinder slaughterhouses so the cows don't feel afraid or even know what's coming. Nowadays she does a lot of public speaking, and some research, I think. Some of the disabled students at my school got to meet her when she came to Ohio.

64618	0	a	So was this little kid living alone or something while his mom was in the hospital? Wtf.
64619	0	a	We need more adults like this kid.
64620	0	a	I'm quite surprised she didn't think anything of it. It was a sweet reason this time, but wanting two lunches generally means the kid is being bullied  and having his lunch taken.
64621	0	a	When I was in 10th grade, my mom was undergoing chemo (they found pre cancerous cells, so thankfully it was caught really) and a divorce and was depressed af. I was supposed to get free lunch, we were poor, but somehow there was a mix up and I wasn't getting it. I didn't want to stress her out, so I didn't tell her. And there wasn't a lot of food in the house. So I just went without lunch.  Until my best friend noticed that it was a recurring thing. She started sharing her lunch with me, or buying new lunch. For the entire year.
64622	0	a	Yea me too.
64623	0	a	Yea, not crack
64624	0	a	When I was in 6th grade (US) my parents would put money in an account I used for buying lunch. One of my friends wasn’t as well off and her parents were getting a divorce so her home life was a mess. A new school year started and things were going awful for her, most days of the week she arrived late and without a lunch or money for lunch. At first I just split my lunch with her but then I’d just buy her a full lunch as well after a few weeks. It wasn’t everyday but it was pretty often.   Mom got mad when only a few months into the year I came to her saying my lunch account was running low. Got a lecture about being responsible with money and eating right ect. Money was supposed to last me until near the winter break.  I was worried I’d get in trouble for buying my friend lunch, so I didn’t tell my mom at first. Went back to splitting my lunch with my friend. Then a neighbor who substitute taught at school caught us splitting lunch and offered to buy my friend lunch thinking she’d lost or forgotten hers. My friend explained the situation, which the neighbor relayed to my mom later that day mentioning what a good kid I was to my mom.  Mom confronted me and I confessed. My mom was like “why didn’t you tell me” and ended up funding more on the account with the condition that I be responsible and healthy with the items we picked.  It’s funny when kids think they’ll get in trouble when doing the right thing. Also by the spring semester things had largely settled down for my friend at home and it wasn’t much of an issue after that.

64627	0	a	OMG. My mom was like your wife and i gotta tell you this shit is the worst. - Why you need that? What's going on? - Ah, just forget about it - Tell me. What is going on? Is something wrong? - Just forget i asked. I realized i don't need it anymore. And then i would basically learn not to ask her about anything, cause kids needs some privacy, and secrets of their own, you know? I can't explain everything to you, because you could think: a)  whatever i'm asking for is just dumb; b) what I'm asking is, for some reason, wrong for you (but not for me apparently); c) want to get involved when i clearly don't want you to. And i gotta tell you this is worst possible action you can take. You do this shit and all my trust I put in you is gone. Just like that. Gone. And you won't rebuild this motherfucker for years, that's for goddamn sure.
64628	0	a	He probably was buying cafeteria lunch and told this persons brother that he missed having his mom pack a lunch for him.   Dad is probably still home, some Dads just refuse to pack lunches or don’t have time in the morning or doesn’t have time while doing double parent duty and visiting his wife.  Or the brother just thought this would make his friend feel better.
64629	0	a	We do. And we need adults to create a society where something like a parent having medical treatment doesn't lead to their kid going without lunch.

64635	0	a	Or the child knew there was so much going on that he didn’t want to put extra tasks on anyone.  Like, “I’ll find something to pack, dad.”  But then he doesn’t cause he’s a kid and the dad is too busy running around keeping everything together to notice.

64771	0	a	Only gonna say this once with my throwaway account. I once was at a bar, more drunk than I usually get these days. Was having a fight with my gf actually and it was our first big fight.   I walk into the bathroom and a guy quickly rushes in behind me. He shuts the door.  And he locks it. Was a one person bathroom. I was able to follow pretty quickly where his mind was at and the locking of the door definitely made me nervous...  He has this light grin on his face (an ‘I shouldn’t be doing this kind of grin’) and you can tell he’s pretty nervous. He gets closer to me, gets on his knees, and he asks if he can suck me off.   I was shocked, but I wasn’t angry. I just never had been in that position before and I felt honestly like prey, but I didn’t think I was in danger at least. He was a little pushy but I politely said “that’s not me man, I’m sorry” and told him best of luck and that I’m not upset.  Definitely won’t forget that experience. And now I know how some women probably feel at bars....

For me, as a mother, I think about the care I offer my child as a guide for how to take care of myself. The ""treat yourself like a toddler"" rule is a great one. If my child is sad, I don't say, ""Sure, stay up all night and watch Netflix because I love you.""  Instead, I say, ""Your fatigue is contributing to your sadness, so let's get you to bed, even though you don't want to."" Most humans need the same stuff to be happy :)"

I hope everyone can succeed in doing their goals as well! 😀
64830	0	a	Huh,  this is actually really cool,  and something I needed to hear today.  My self loathing's been a real bitch and I think this might help.   It reminds me of the Japanese art of Kintisugi.  The Japanese have a well known and centuries old art of taking damaged pottery and filling in the cracks with lacquered gold,  silver,  or platinum.  You get some absolutely stunning pieces and they often come out even more unique and durable than before.  It's been a hugely useful metaphor for recovery for me.  No matter how deep my wounds,  how fucked up I was in the past,  I can heal,  and find ways to use those wounds to make myself better.    I can be wiser,  better,  and perhaps I can prevent someone from doing all the stupid shit I did.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi)

64837	0	a	Congrats to you!  Some people might not understand it...but that’s okay.  Sometimes these small tasks are huge mountains for people.  I have suffered from anxiety issues for the last decade.  I can totally relate to using your partner as a crutch.  I got so bad that sometimes I couldn’t even go check my mailbox or answer the door.  Those first few times forcing myself to check the mailbox felt like I was climbing a mountain.  But it’s baby steps.  I’d say that you being able to go get coffee across town by yourself is wonderful.  I myself wouldn’t even be able to push myself that much right now.  Celebrate those victories for yourself.  I have found that with anxiety, you need to reenforce the positives as much as possible.  Because your anxiety brain will focus on the negative anyways.  So you go on with your bad self!!!!  Lol
64838	0	a	Be careful that you're not the one always calling others toxic for every little thing you don't like, or disagree with, because it might be you yourself that is the toxic one.
64839	0	a	Preach.  I cut ties with one of my oldest friends this year, whilst living in the same house as him, for these exact reasons.  He could not see the role he was playing in our friendship 'game', as I like to refer to it.  But recognising how others behold you is tricky, and can often leave one feeling quite empty and used.  But it is your life and only you can make something of it. Don't spend years in co-dependent friendships that are not built on respect.
64840	0	a	If you notice yourself often feeling kinda bad after talking to a specific friend, that might be a toxic friendship. And it's totally okay to end the friendship.

64843	0	a	It is nice that you are turning it around - but you have a lot of work to do. This isn’t about you, it’s about her. You actively abused her to the point she was begging your parents to keep some distance on her day. I don’t know about every 12 year old girl, but that isn’t easy. I can’t imagine what she’s already gone through.   If you aren’t making sure she is safe and loved and happy for the rest of both your lives, you’ve failed.
64844	0	a	Thanks :) The more I think about it, the cooler it becomes that she wrote a letter instead of just telling me in person. I'm going to keep it in my wallet or something and read it occasionally when I'm feeling sad or probably more importantly, mean.
64845	0	a	Hey buddy, on behalf of Riot I commend you for pushing yourself to be a better person and focusing on what is important! I myself had to learn self control in college and forswore MMO's after Everquest had me staying up to all hours of the night and blowing off classes...

Wherever your life takes you, whether it is back to LoL, on to other games, or too much other stuff for video games at all, I wish you the best :)

64863	0	a	Thank you friend. I desperately need a friend. I just quit drinking 95 days ago & mine went poof. I’m fighting a war on a massive flea infestation in my house. It’s my fault & I feel like I’m doing everything wrong! My bed is covered in layers of TOO MUCH diatomaceous Earth & it’s making my tiny chihuahua sick. I have sprayed, bombed, sprayed, vacuumed & I was trying to do the right thing. My girl is ten years old & has a collapsed Trachea. The dust is bothering her. My problems seem insurmountable & all my Mother can say is find the lord again. Good grief. I can do this right? I can do this & my dog will be ok. I’m crying as I type but just bc I can tell someone who might care. Thank you & I hope you have a day as beautiful as you are. To everyone else, I’m sorry to post this...I’m just so overwhelmed & alone.

Try to change your lifestyle, keep busy doing what you like and of course give some quality time to yourself. Learn to adjust yourself. At the end, No one is having a good time nowadays,therefore, we have to make the best of each day. Keep Fighting. Our worse enemy is inside ourselves.

64870	0	a	It’s a matter of perspective.   You’ve put your entire life into a checklist where You won’t let yourself be happy unless you hit those boxes.  The fact you looked to start your own business is a big undertaking and shows risk taking. The fact that you’re still here and you learned from it? Resilience.   Take what you’ve learned and apply it now! Meeting new and interesting people is all about risk taking and resilience. Women aren’t any exception to that.   Where ever you are, that’s where you’re at. Find the beauty and let it reel you in.
64871	0	a	I agree that when you are younger you definitely have a lot more time to experiment, test things out and gain all the experiences that you need.  However, you life is your life and the choices you made are the ones that you were meant to. 20's, 30's, 40's, these are all just numbers and you can do whatever you want, at whatever age you are. Just because you are reaching 30 and you have not experienced the things you wanted to, does not mean you cannot do them tomorrow and gain them in a way that you enjoy.  This is all coming from someone who is the same age as you but did have the travel experiences, did have the love experiences, did have the friend experiences and the moving to the big new city experiences. I had all of these and I did get a lot out of them BUT I can also look to other people who did more than me and wish I had that level of opportunity and suddenly all of my past seems wasted. Sound familiar?  The point is, the grass is always greener and it is never to late to do the things you want and gain the experiences you desire. It is a mindset that your  20's are the best time for you to do this because you control your actions, not the amount of times you have gone around the sun. It all comes down to you, one day just taking the step to become better. We all can do this, whenever we need to. You just need to commit and allow discipline and momentum to keep pushing you forward.
64872	0	a	Can confirm the above, I am a woman and almost in an identical predicament except that I have dated and been intimate with men. I even started my own business like you and failed.  I am also a musician too and have social anxiety and get scared I’m going to mess up on stage.   I think the dating thing takes a tonne of effort and is scary as fuck and when you interact with those people you find attractive, you may also find that you don’t have that much in common and they aren’t as intimidating as you once thought. I’ve learnt to not put people on a pedestal and not develop a connection in my head to their looks. Looks are nice and being attracted to someone is nice but if there is no conversation or connection then I force myself to see only that.   There are people in this world that will make a million mistakes and do one thing right and only focus on that one right thing and there are people that do a million things right and make one mistake and only focus on that one mistake, I think you and I are the latter. You’re doing okay OP and you shouldn’t beat yourself up so much.
64873	0	a	My mom always says that you have to love yourself before someone loves you, and I’ve found that to be true in my own life. Dating and relationships are hard as hell, especially if you’re getting in your own way due to low self-esteem etc. I don’t know how old you are but it wasn’t until my late 20s that I started having quality relationships, and a lot of that had to do with me finally developing a little self-confidence and self-awareness.   Good for you for taking steps to improve your mental outlook! Here’s hoping the perfect person for you is right around the corner!

64921	0	a	My dad would know how you feel. Never say never, although I definitely get wanting to pick your own buddy.  We got a beagle when I was 5, who lived to be 13 years old. My dad never really gets emotional, he’s not into all that, but his love for animals is a different kind. My parents and I took her to the vet to euthanize her when she was no longer able to stand up. She’d already been urine incontinent for a bit. The only other time I’d seen my dad cry that hard was when his own father passed. He buried her in our back yard absolutely sobbing as he lowered her body into the whole. That moment is burned into my brain. He swore he’d never get another dog again, didn’t want one. Didn’t want to feel that pain again.   About 2 years later, I saw a rescue shelter post that they had a lab mix liter for adoption. To this day I’m not really sure why I felt so pushed to submit an application for a puppy, but I did and I was pretty persistent about our interest. We got approved to come pick out our 8 week old pup. Only my mom and I went, because my dad was so extremely against this idea. He was hoping we wouldn’t *actually* come back with one.   Well, we did. We picked out a chunky brown boy and named him Winston. When we walked through the door with him, I swear my dad could have killed us. He didn’t talk for the rest of the day, and he pretended like our new puppy wasn’t even there.   It took a couple weeks, but my dad began to warm up to our new boy. Fast forward 5 years, and I don’t think my dad has ever loved a dog more. Since our beagle was purebred, there wasn’t a lot we could do with her off the leash without her bolting to follow a trail. Our Winston is much more laid back, and loves to just follow my dad around outside. My dad even takes him on leisurely walks through the woods, something we could never do with our Beagle. I’ve since moved out, and unfortunately my mom left my dad, but Winston stayed at the house with dad, because there’s no separating them now. Winston even barks at my dad when it’s time to go to bed. He’s one of the most charismatic dogs I’ve ever met.   I utterly hate to think about the day my dad will have to say goodbye to him. It will surely be harder than the loss of our first family dog. It probably gets harder every time, if I had to guess. I know when that time comes my dad will probably hate me for being the one who introduced him to the vulnerability again, but I won’t be sorry for the years of happiness and love his companion brought him.   Getting another dog doesn’t have to be considered “replacing” your beloved past dog, although it sure feels that way. The way I always try to think of it is that your dog would probably want you to love another the same way you spoiled and loved them.

64929	0	a	"Before you project your bs onto the daughter, mom, or father, this is what she has to say about it.      Original vid is titled “Cleared my daddy child support balance after he’s been on it for 16 years. This was his reaction:”  My mom put him on it when I was really young. He paid it. But she also asked for 30k in back pay. He thought when I turned 18 he didn’t have to pay it anymore. But he did and wasn’t able to keep up w 600/ monthly. Today I cleared his balance. He no longer owes them anything.  For y’all that don’t understand. When you can’t keep up w child support they garnish your pay, your tax refund, your drivers license, your passport. My daddy been on child support since he was 23. He’s 40 now. He deserved this.  He owed $27k in interest alone. That should tell u something  I did all the groundwork and she (mom) signed the papers. It was a process      In response to ”I hope this doesn’t offend you but your mom is awful for that lol”   ""She isn’t. She had her reasons. It’s in the past now.""      ---      #/r/MensLib"
64930	0	a	My ex didn’t pay child support for the entirety of my son’s childhood. My child and I had some difficult times...heat and electricity turned off, not enough food, too tight shoes. At times we depended on food stamps and other social services. But we made it through. My ex left the country to avoid paying his considerable arrears after the state rescinded his driver’s license and issued a warrant for his arrest for failure to pay child support. The weekend my son graduated from college, we came home to a letter from a lawyer saying that the ex wanted to return to the US and wanted to pay 18 years of child support back at once. He asked if we would forgive the interest. I talked to my son and we agreed to forgive it, and sent a message through the lawyer that we wished him well. My son was raised, he was/is a great guy, and every time I looked at his face, he reminded me of all the best qualities of my ex.  Edit: For some context, the interest was over $6k.
64931	0	a	You can hear the release of stress. What a great daughter!
64932	0	a	That's crazy. Glad everything worked out though. Good on your mom for signing the papers.
64933	0	a	Thank you for posting the context..!   Also, after reading that last sentence, she has admirable maturity about the entire situation.
64934	0	a	If she and her mom are cool with it good for them. Child support shouldn’t be about punishing anyone, it’s about participating in the raising of the child. I do not like it when the government steps in and makes it worse instead of helping what is already a highly emotional and stressful situation.
64935	0	a	It’s not that simple. Kids are expensive and responsibility for that needs to be shared between the parents. I say this as a step-mom who’s husband pays child support in a joint custody situation.
64936	0	a	Yeah, I am very impressed by the daughter's ability to empathize with both her mother and father. People aren't morally black and white and situations can be very complex. I'm glad it's all been worked out.
64937	0	a	One of the milestones of adolescence is realizing your parents are flawed human beings just like you. Becoming an adult is forgiving them for it.

64965	0	a	Na man don’t take your frustration out on women being supportive and empowering each other. In all honesty there are toxic elements of feminism but EVERY single group, demographic, race, ect has a minority or subset of assholes which unfortunately are  loudest.  This video is awesome and the message is awesome. As a  male I have had numerous role models in media to look up to and it’s nice to see young girls, like this, can feel stronger when there are empowering role models to look up to. I have a younger sister and if I ever have a daughter one day I want her to have the feelings of strength in who they can be and opportunities I have had.   I know i just gave a rant and you may just be trolling but if you took the time to read great.

64972	0	a	I don't understand.  Start at the beginning.  What is a farm and what is a family?
64973	0	a	Okay, so, a farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops, sometimes you see cows and piggies.  A family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship) you sometimes get babies and doggies in one.   I hope this cleared things for you

64987	0	a	I've been an occupational therapist for a number of years I'm currently working in home care. when I was working in outpatient ,this was the number one reason for referrals for client Parkinson's folks. Usually right after the holidays there was a big influx of early 50s to Mid 60 year old males to work on gait and strength. They said they had a timeline to be able to walk their daughters down the aisle by a certain month. My friend who is the head physical therapist in that department loved the first part of the year because his secret passion was working with Parkinson's folks. Did your dad work with the BIG program? If not he really should look into it,it is a wonderful program. The therapist who would be doing it with him are specifically certified and trained with special techniques. The most challenging part is finding certified therapist.
64988	0	a	He did not, but I'll have to tell him about it!  He has been battling depression because he can't move like he used to (in three years, he left the house maybe 15 times) but our wedding definitely was motivation to get out and start living his life again.  I think if he had more physical therapy, it would definitely help with the depression.

64998	0	a	My old aunt had Downs. She died when she was is her 60’s. We had her over for every thanksgiving and she LOVED my husband. She would always say, “Where’s my boyfriend!” And she often grabbed his ass!! We decided it was hilarious and laughed our asses off.  EDIT: To anyone who has issues with this:  1. SHE HAD CONSENT after the first time. My husband and I discussed it and he said it was not a big deal and was fine.   2. He let her do it as she wanted because she had dementia. DEMENTIA. She wasn’t always this way, and back then she didn’t do it. It was only with the arrival of Alzheimer’s.  3. Folks, the scale of the infraction is so minor, and the details here matter.  Life isn’t black and white. It’s grays. Lots of grays.
64999	0	a	"The son reminds me of my very Downs uncle whom we call ""cousin"". So gentle. So loving. I worry about him when his second parent passes away though."
65000	0	a	My younger brother had it.  One of the best people I’ve ever known, which is why I asked him to be the best man at my wedding.  I get why other people sometimes just saw the condition, but I swear to God most of the time I forgot and just thought of it as his personal quirks.  I sometimes laugh when I think of the times that I’d introduce him to people and forget to tell them he had Down Syndrome.  He was always just the guy who like to liked to watch me play video games, or would get scared at lame action movies.  I remember that he used to call me his hero for “saving” him from a scary looking moth, or a house gecko that looked somehow vicious.  He passed years ago, but I still ache to see him again.  I wish I could have him tell me “good luck at your work” or “I love you with all of my heart” again.  When his visitation was done and we leaving the night before his funeral I made sure to close the door and tell him goodnight just like I did when we were growing up.  I know that this comment is buried, and he passed years ago so most people won’t understand why it still hurts.  I feel like an amputee or something that he is gone.
65001	0	a	My uncle was downs but he was more like an awesome big brother. He got me into the WWF in the late 80s and we used to watch every pay per view together. He did a mean Hulk Hogan impersonation. I made him the best man at my wedding because I honestly didnt know a better man. The doctors told my grandparents that he would be a burden on them and that they should give him up, when he was born. He lived a long and awesome life and brought a lot of happiness to others. I miss him so much.
65002	0	a	It’s okay. Normally I wouldn’t tolerate such a thing. But she has an intellectual disability and we don’t want to make a big deal out of nothin g.  When she comes over she wants a “beer and a piece of pie. Cherry pie!” That one beer affected her so she got a tiny buzz maybe and got uninhibited. She was always sweet and usually did not act inappropriately—we asked when it first happened because we have nurses in the family.   When folks with Downs get old, many of them develop Alzheimer’s. At this point in her life she had been showing signs of dementia for several years. I’m an RN and I know dementia first hand. Some people who get demented or have damage in a certain area will become quite uninhibited, and they do things like grab people’s asses.   So yeah while I would be the first one to intervene if I saw anyone touch another inappropriately, she is family. We know why she did it and she is not sexual at all. It never went farther than that, and she never said anything other than how he’s a hunk (he is) and she wanted to hug him. That’s it. Harmless like a child. We just let it go because we get it: she’s not harming anyone and she’s not aware of the implications of doing it.

65017	0	a	I'm super happy for this guy, but also wondering how they could legally do a procedure on him without him knowing exactly what they were doing?
65018	0	a	Lovely video.  Sucks our health care system is such shit, and that dental and vision isn’t even included in our normal health care.  This shouldn’t be an uplifting story bc this should have never happened for so long untreated.  No one should live like this — for lots of reasons, but especially bc dental health is linked to heart health and other medical issues.    Glad for this man though.  His happiness is palpable.
65019	0	a	Maybe didn’t even read and signed the forms?
65020	0	a	No, medical consent requires that the doctor tell the patient all the risks of a procedure before they agree. The patient must understand the risks for it to be legal. I assume it is the same in dentistry, since they are basically teeth doctors.
65021	0	a	I asked my Dad to be my best man.   He cried.  I cried.   He gave the most epic best man speech ever.  One of the best decisions I have ever made.

65028	0	a	"If it makes you feel any better they didn't tell him he would never walk.  Doctors don't really do that. They might say it's unlikely, but they aren't just going to be like, ""you'll never walk so we aren't even going to give a fuck, just sit there and whatever.""  The reason he can walk is probably do to physical therapy and being encouraged to walk by the people who said it may be unlikely."
65029	0	a	Thank you for the reply, and I’m assuming you know this family? And I’m guessing if you don’t then it’s meant well... however, I was told that my daughter would *never* walk. By a doctor. More than one. And lots of times.   Apparently, it was to help me accept that she never would.   She never has, and never will.   Just for a second I pictured myself in the father’s place and imagined how I would feel.   That’s why my heart hurt.    Edit. Downvoted for relaying my experience as a parent of a child with quadriplegic cerebral palsy or for another reason?   Edit: And there is a world of difference between a doctor saying “your child will be completely unable to walk because of <insert medical reasons> so we will be focussing on comfort and seated mobility with possible weight bearing for bone density” and “you’ll never walk so just sit there, we don’t give a fuck or whatever”.

The crumbling attempts to stay composed are so much more powerful. He keeps that little growl in his voice like he's not phased all the way up until he makes eye contact with his family and then the bubble bursts.
65040	0	a	This is probably my favorite sub. Seeing a man cry tears of joy is powerful stuff. Gives you a little perspective on stuff. These probably aren't wildly expensive but maybe for them it's an unneeded cost and clearly someone saved up just to give this man a dream experience. Fucking...awesome

65073	0	a	I am so happy that women out there have fathers that love and cherish them, are capable of joy, and take an interest in their child's lives. It's so nice to see. It makes me angry that my dad sucks but it also fills me with so much happiness that there are ladies out there who can count on their fathers and are excited to share with them. It makes me jealous sometimes (like I so wish this guy was also my dad) because I never had momnets like this, but also reminds me that not every dad is like mine and gives me hope for my daughter. I know my husband is going to be a wonderful father and I know my girl will love him as much as this dude's daughter loves this dad. That means I get to see moments like this between them for all their lives. ❤️

65084	0	a	Agreed.  This actually happens to a lot of hospitalized patients. If they don’t have friends/family to take over, it’s a possibility that they lose their pets. If they can’t bring them into the hospital, and the vet/shelter the pets are at doesn’t know what’s going on or act on it, they can be sent to a shelter. It’s very unfortunate, but also hard to intervene as a stranger.
65085	0	a	When he asks “And Why’s that?” fully expecting some company policy shit, but then is greeted with the fact that he can actually take his babies home for free, you can tell he isn’t used to things like this, which is a crying shame.

65098	0	a	Kevin Mawae was such a beast for the Jets for so long.   In the late nineties I went to a lot of games with my dad. One time, I saw him hustle off the field, find a trainer, and lift his arm. He had a massive, bloody gash running from his pinky to his elbow. Blood everywhere, dripping onto his pants, jersey, and all over the turf. The trainer gauzed it, taped it up, and he was back on the field within a few plays. Such a gnarly dude.

65126	0	a	This is a great video. I have a question i have always wanted to ask. Why does it take that long to write childrens books? Is it the story? The Pictures? What makes a person a good childrens book writer, especially for those books for kids aged between 1-4?
65127	0	a	I'm not the best person to articulate what makes a *good* children's book author, but as my wife's job involves children's book publishing, I can say that I've seen so many *bad* children's books that it's become abundantly clear to me how hard it is to do them well. Some of the problems I've seen:  * Picture books where the text is way too long * *So many* books written in shitty iambic pentameter * Shocking number of books written in rhyming verse where the author seems completely clueless about the rhythm of the words * Books that condescend to the audience. It is actually possible, unfortunately, to be unnecessarily condescending even to very small children * Books that are basically one long, tortured, uninteresting didactic metaphor for some social/developmental issue. Or even worse, don't even manage to scrape together a metaphor and are just didactic and boring. It's great to write books that help kids to internalize good values. But it's actually really hard to do this in an effective way. * Books that are just fucking *boring*, even/especially for kids.  So I guess a good children's author is able to produce a book that is the opposite of all the things above. Like I said, I can't articulate all the elements of good children's writing, but a few things I've noticed:  * Good children's books tend to be *really* creative in ways that you might not even notice until you reflect on them. It's a level of creativity that's hard to pull off, and yet the effect is often very subtle. * Many of my favorite children's books - both when I was a kid and now, as a parent - involve an element of danger, or something like a little bit of darkness at the edges. It validates a feeling you have as a kid - a feeling you need to be able to process, and can also find thrilling, even when you're quite young. Think of *Where the Wild Things Are*, or *Harold and the Purple Crayon* (Harold is only playing an imaginary game with his crayon, yet on another level he's utterly lost in the world until he remembers what it is that comforts him about his room), or even the darknesses lurking outside the edges of the light in *Goodnight Moon* * Good children's books, like good parents and good teachers, take children seriously, even when they're being very silly.

65134	0	a	When I left for Iraq in 2006 my son was 2 weeks old. When I came home he was 15 months.  I'm 45 days out from my wife having my second child and I'm am so scared and happy. I completely understand this man's feelings.  It was so scary to think I wouldn't come home (I was a scout sniper) and every mission I would take my pictures, wedding ring, and name tapes off on the off chance I was killed or captured (I didn't want my family identified). Or if one of my family members was hurt and I was so far away. The emotional turmoil of a deployment is crazy.  Seriously choked up.

He went to the washroom, and my buddy loaded the air blaster and when the kid came he blasted him and the kid fell backwards into the bathroom. My buddy had a good chuckle and returned to work. Well the kid didn't come out of the bathroom for 20mins, finally we noticed he had not come out and when we opened the door we found him lying on the ground. My buddy stated freaking out insanely worried and flipped him over to start CPR. The kid was fine, but he had a sopping wet towel from the toilet that he slapped my buddy in the face with as soon as he could.  Those were good days.

65229	0	a	You can really see his diaper in this image.
65230	0	a	This will be downvoted but at least you will know. His forward lean is 100% designed to hide his massive chest and gut. He has learned from years of being on camera that he can lean forward and his suit jacket will hang straight and create the illusion of a flat chest. It only works when he’s squared up to the camera. From the side it looks ridiculous. Shoe lifts don’t make you lean forward.
65231	0	a	You know, a lot of middle aged men have to get their prostates removed due to cancer, which can cause temporary and permanent incontinence based on the amount of nerve and muscle that needs removed.

65284	0	a	One thing that I want to mention (I already replied something similar to the haters at the bottom so that they can learn something) is that this is excellent classroom management! If you respect children and make them feel seen and heard, they are more likely to respect you in return! That respect takes the form of following class rules. If every child respected the teacher and sat and was receptive to his lesson, everyone would have a better learning experience as opposed to having the lesson constantly stopped while the teacher disciplines unruly students.

65289	0	a	Look. I'm way better at building relationships than I am teaching. I admit that fact. I'll take the Pepsi challenge with any colleague I've ever had in getting to really know my kids.  I have some old guard colleagues who work their asses off. They put in way way more time and energy than I do *teaching*the  kids. They don't build shit for relationships. They teach. When kids tell me they don't like Ms whatever, they will always then agree that Ms whatever is a **good** teacher.  All I'm saying is this man may make kids enjoy school and enjoy being in his class. And that makes them more willing to learn. But it doesn't make him an amazing teacher, just a good person.  Teachers that genuinely enjoy students are unfortunately rare, but so are the teachers who go in and just teach their balls off. And those ones never get much credit because they aren't flashy and kids don't yell out their name when they walk through the lunchroom. But it's a lot easier to do the job every day when kids idolize you. Ms whatever is on that grind simply because she was born to be a teacher.

65340	0	a	Worked at a gas station where we gave away a 2 liter pop with every 30 liters of gas for the cost of the deposit only. Several dozen people wouldn’t take the pop, so we would pay out of pocket for the deposit and then spend our down time gathering up all the shitty flavors, tossing them in air as high as we could and launching the pop rockets into the surrounding area. These days it’s all developed and there are just too many cars, but back then there was nothing g but fields around the station and it was the most fun you could have for 20 cents.

When you leave lumber outside some is more wet than others and will dry and crown twist or bow at different rates. To do this he probably planed all the lumber himself and put it on a lazer leveled foundation and re checked the level/plane after. Or you know his level is bent like a ski and he's just pulling a fast one on us. I guarantee 99.9% of people's floor joists are not done this nice.

I was the last person to enter, gave it a spin for luck. I win nothing and this jackass wins the first prize, which was a bunch of merchandise and a 1/50 chance at the bike (they were doing one drawing per state then the grand drawing).   He calls me two or three months later and tells me he won. They flew him out all expenses paid to watch them build the bike, pick out his parts, and party nonstop (smoking $100 cigars and drinking all day) for a long weekend.  All in all everything he got was probably over $30,000 worth of stuff including the bike. I won the pleasure of teaching him how to ride a motorcycle. I might sound bitter but I'm really happy for him. He doesn't have a lot of money and it was a struggle for him to get the money for the taxes together but he loves that bike more than anything, and he really appreciates it.  So moral of the story is, it happens.

65621	0	a	"It sounds like you're confusing [sidereal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time) with [solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time).  A sidereal day is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to rotate by 360°, and is indeed 23h56m4s.  A solar day is the interval between two successive instances of the Sun crossing the [local meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_\(astronomy\)).  Since the Earth moves by roughly 1° around the Sun each day, the Earth has to rotate by roughly 361° for the Sun to cross the local meridian.  In [this image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sidereal_day_\(prograde\).png), sidereal time is the difference between the blue circles labelled ""1"" and ""2"", where solar time is the difference between the blue circles labelled ""1"" and ""3""."
65622	0	a	"That's how long it takes for a 360° rotation of the earth. Since it's also revolving around the sun it requires more than a 360° turn for the same point to be facing the sun again. Therefore, a ""day"" as we know it is more than 360° and a lot closer to 24 hours than your estimate."
65623	0	a	"Your math is off, we add add the lap day because the solar year is actually about 365 1/4 days, we add the extra day every 4 years to account for that. We actually had to change it a while back to account for the fact that its slightly less the 365 1/4   Heres a better explanation...  The exact length of a solar year is actually 11 minutes and 14 seconds less than 365 ¼ days. That means that even if you add a leap day every four years, the calendar would still overshoot the solar year by a little bit—11 minutes and 14 seconds per year. These minutes and seconds really start to add up: after 128 years, the calendar would gain an entire extra day. So, the leap year rule, ""add a leap year every four years"" was a good rule, but not good enough!  Calendar Correction, Part II  To rectify the situation, the creators of our calendar (the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582) decided to omit leap years three times every four hundred years. This would shorten the calendar every so often and rid it of the annual excess of 11 minutes and 14 seconds. So in addition to the rule that a leap year occurs every four years, a new rule was added: a century year is not a leap year unless it is evenly divisible by 400. This rule manages to eliminate three leap years every few hundred years.  https://www.infoplease.com/leap-year-101-next-when-list-days-calendar-years-calculation-last-rules"
65624	0	a	No, 23h25m4s is the length of a *sideral day*, which is the time it takes to face the same direction relevant to an object outside the solar system (such as the galactic center). A solar day (the time it takes for the sun to reach the same angle in the sky) is about 24 hours (give or take a few seconds on certain days, considering the earth moves at different speeds at different parts of its ellipse).  Leap years are a different kettle of fish. You see, the speed at which the earth rotates, and the speed at which it revolves around the sun are not connected, and the solar year is 365d5h48m46s (which is 11m14s less than 365.25 days) so we accumulate nearly a quarter of a day (to be specific, 24.219907407407407407407407407407%) per year, which would mean over time, our calendar would slip and we'd end up with summer in the northern hemisphere for christmas! over the course of 100 years, autumn would begin to creep into august, and spring into January, as the seasons shifted over by 24 days. So, we could add an extra day ever 4 years to fix it right? However, since the solar year is 11m14s shorter than that .25, we're now shifting 11m14s a year in the other direction. in 128 years, we'd be one day off. So we do better by NOT including an extra day on years divisible by 100. But we also knew we could do better, so we made an exception to that rule: If the year was divisible by 400 it WOULD be a Leap Year. Now it will take 3300 years to diverge for the calendar year and solar year to converge by a single day!
65625	0	a	This is the answer. All the leap year mumbo jumbo is essentially independent of this
65626	0	a	360 degrees in a circle, 365 days in a year, eg, like you said, ~1 degree a day. I don't know why, but that's pretty cool to think about like that and I never had before.  Thanks!
65627	0	a	The approximately 24 hour day that we know is called a solar day, and the 4 minute shorter day is called a stellar day.  edit:  Just as a ball park calculation to see why it's four minutes shorter: with respect to the sun, in 365 days, the Earth rotates 366 times (365 times around its own axis, and once due to its orbit). With respect to itself, the Earth rotates 365 times in that time. So the following two ratios should be about the same:  366/(24*60) = 0.254166...  365/(24*60-4) = 0.254178...   
65628	0	a	Yep. The actual length of a day is 24 hours and 0.002 seconds on average (and very gradually getting longer as the Moon recedes).
65629	0	a	Exactly. After one solar year, the earth has made 366.25 rotations relative to the universe. But since the earth is rotating around the sun in the same direction, we experience only 365.25 sunsets each year.
65630	0	a	Seriously, this explanation made me feel smarter for understanding it. Hi, I'm 37 years old and I learned something today that I can teach my son.
65631	0	a	Interesting is that the closeness of both numbers (degrees in a circle and days in a year) is not a coincidence.   5150 years ago the sumerians were the first (that we know of) to count the days of the year (to know when to seed the grains, and using the fact that the shadow of a stone at noon each day repeats after a year). They got the 360±4 days number, which is relatively close to 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360 - and they already considered the 3 x 4 x 5 = 60 a pretty magic number (roughly how we consider 100 a significant number today) so surely that cannot be a coincidence, it must mean something!   So the sumerians picked a 360 days year, and decreed that the remaining 5 days are outside of the year, so why work then if nobody counted interest on loans during those  days (by religious decree), let's spent 5 days partying, drinking, and celebrating the new year!   And this is why we have 360 degrees around the circle - one degree is the distance covered by the Earth around the sun during one day.  
65632	0	a	A.K.A. sidereal time.
65633	0	a	If you think that's cool, try the implications: first, the Earth rotates by a degree every 4 minutes, and by 15 degrees an hour.  Second, if you go outside and look at the stars, and you want to see the stars tomorrow night in exactly the same position they're in now, you need to look 4 minutes earlier.
65634	0	a	Which is, counterintuitively, pronounced sigh-deer-eal.
65635	0	a	No, this is handled by leap seconds rather than leap years.  Leap seconds adjust the daytime so sunrise isn't eventually at 2PM.  Leap years adjust the seasons so spring isn't eventually in September (in the northern hemisphere).
65636	0	a	"put a chair in the middle of the room. look at the chair. spin yourself in a circle (pirouette) and end looking at the chair again.  Thats 360 degrees.   Now spin yourself in a circle, while simultaneously taking a step around the room, and still end up facing the chair. Because you moved around the room you have to turn further than 360 degrees to end up facing the chair again.   (If you walk around the room the ""wrong"" way, it will be less than 360 degrees, if you walk around it the ""right"" way, it will be more than 360 degrees)  So if you keep spinning and going around you could count two things  1) How many times did I look straight at the chair. (solar day) 2) How many times did I spin in a complete circle (360 degrees)  Those are two different numbers.

65648	0	a	"There is a fixed amount of water available in the basin that varies only slowly over decade time scales. So if Ethiopia builds a dam close to the source of the water and stores it there this will have results downstream. A minor effect would be the evaporation from the lake which would be lost to the region (the recycling factor in the Ethiopian highlands is small). A major effect would be a quick fill which would temporarily cut off water supply to the downstream areas. A long term effect would be that in times of drought Ethiopia has control over the distribution and can keep more water for itself. All of these are negative effects for Egypt's water security. As for the claim that Egypt's waterflow is increased by reducing Lake Nasser evaporation, this is really a wry statement. It means that they might reduce the level of Lake Nasser by siphoning of more water upstream thereby decreasing the volume of the lake and the area from which it can evaporate. That might slightly reduce evaporation in Egypt which is what they could mean by ""increased water flow"" but I don't see how Egypt's total water budget would increase because of this.  That said, if Ethiopia's dam is properly managed it might increase the overall water security of the region, something that would also benefit Egypt. It all depends on the amount of irrigation Ethiopia is going to develop with this dam."
65649	0	a	"The dam will reduce evaporation (deeper water with less relative surface area), but Egypt WILL get less water while the dam fills (could take a year or more depending drought), and then they are reliant on Ethiopia to let the water flow. I see no reason why Ethiopia would ever send that ""saved water"" to Egypt. "
65650	0	a	Its like temporarily moving the surface area of Lake Nassir upstream to Ethiopia, and then adding a lot more volume in depth. The water in the middle and the bottom does not evaporate, only the water exposed to the surface is in danger of evaporating due to the hot and dry air of northern Africa.   It will not just be better, it will be a LOT better. The average amount of water that falls in the mountains of Ethiopia is fairly well set. It will not grow. It flows down the mountains to Egypt, and in the shallow Lake Nassir, much of it evaporates into the air.   To keep as much of the Ethiopian rain in storage as possible, it must be stored in a deep reservoir in the cool and moister high Ethiopian location, then flow it down to Egypt as needed.   The hot and dry-air Lake Nassir MUST be made smaller, and the reservoirs in the high, cool, and moist Ethiopian mountains MUST be made larger.  Egypt hates this because it gives Ethiopia control over a vital resource, and they do not trust each other. If Ethiopia and Egypt were one country, this would have been done long ago...
65651	0	a	Liquid will only evaporate from the surface exposed to air, and so is dependent on and relative to exposed surface area. As you fill a container with liquid, the surface area exposed to air will by necessity increase at a slower rate than the volume being stored, if at all (in the case of vertical or narrowing container walls as height increases). So the deeper your container is filled, the slower evaporation will happen relative to the volume of liquid contained within. 
65652	0	a	While you're probably right, it actually depends on the surface area, elevation and environmental conditions at the location of the two lakes.   It might be that Lake Nasser is very large and shallow in an extremely dry area, and the newly created lake in Ethiopia is extremely deep with almost no surface area.  I'm not sure what the situation is or the proposal, but they could be correct...not saying it's a good deal as a result.

65656	0	a	"To be more precise, it is:   ""I can reduce the total amount of taxes that both of us pay combined by holding on to more of the money.""   The evaporation rate of the GERD is expected to be much lower than from Lake Nasser. So the dam should result in more total water being available to Egypt and Ethiopia combined, but it seems extremely unlikely that Ethiopia will only draw off the water saved by those efficiency gains.  "
65657	0	a	This is just incorrect. Dams can increase water supply when you need it, I.e when the flow is low. So on sum you won’t get more water, but your minimums will be way less minimum, while your maxes will be lower by a similar amount.  If managed well, This is a good thing.
65658	0	a	"The point of the Aswan High dam / Lake Nasser is to control water flow - prevent flooding in the spring and droughts in the fall. If that water flow was regularized further up the river, where it's cooler and there's less evaporation, then the Aswan dam needs to hold less water, and hence less overall evaporation.  Of course, if Ethiopia uses the resulting lake storage to increase their irrigation, then there would be less water downstream. This is something the Western US states have been fighting over for years, with the Colorado river. It feels a bit condescending to accuse either Ethiopia or Egypt of being ""unable"" to manage the water when the history of the Colorado River Compact shows that we're perfectly willing to make up flow data and otherwise misrepresent the facts to steal water from each other.

With large body surface area burn patients, very hard to feed them enough, even with a feeding tube 24 hrs a day to meet calorie requirements to heal.  Edit for additional info: Acute critical illness can lead to catabolism exceeding anabolism, even in adequately nourished people. Obesity, is equal or more risk for wasting.
65661	0	a	A distal injury won't affect another injury until it begins needing more resources than the body has to distribute - take burns for example.   If you had a burn on your hand all sorts of plasma and proteins and immune related cells would be rushing to the site (some already there) causing both local inflammation and an immune response that ultimately results in a blister - the blister is full of immune cells that help to repair the damaged tissues by providing an ideal micro environment for healing. Now let's say there's a burn to a large portion of your body; depending on the degree and the inflammation response (3rd degree burns have a different response as many of the biological channels of cell repair are completely destroyed) while your body will send out all its required immune cells that it has it might simply not be enough - in this case bacterial infections can take hold in the blisters as they provide an ideal environment for certain infections to grow, this results in sepsis and eventually septic shock. Imagine that the bodies immune repair system is spread too thin to repair both burns - it doesn't have a very good system at establishing where it should send immune cells with regard to controlling sepsis beyond directing blood away from the extremities and towards critical organs as septic shock progresses.   Ultimately it depends on the nature of the two injuries but yes they could affect one another.
65662	0	a	To answer the question simply, yes, absolutely.   Different types of illness have unique calorie requirements.   A polytrauma patient is different than a septic patient is different than a burn patient with regards to protein, carbohydrate, electrolyte, and fluid requirements.   A dietician who works in the ICU could probably answer this question a lot more thoroughly than I can. I usually just write the order for a nutrition consult and leave it up to them.   Source, am a doc, although this is definitely not my area of expertise. 
65663	0	a	I understood the first part. But my medical and anatomical knowledge is limited :(
65664	0	a	Wow. I'm curious now how many calories are used in the repair of different injuries.  UPDATE : http://ask.metafilter.com/112868/How-to-measure-calories-burned-to-heal-from-various-injuries
65665	0	a	>very hard to feed them enough, even with a feeding tube 24 hrs a day to meet calorie requirements to heal.  is the hard limit the amount of stuff you can physically get in there or the body's ability to process it once it's inside? 
65666	0	a	Does that mean that in some cases it's better to leave a blister intact to heal on its own instead of popping it?
65667	0	a	> (Bone isn't a tissue but you get what i mean) with two types of ressources to rebuild.  Of course bone is a tissue. It contains osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and various other cell types. They require the same nutrients as every other cell, and osteoblasts require calcium on top of that.   As to the original question, I don't think there are any data to suggest that a local injury affects regeneration of a more distant local injury. To put things in perspective, your skin and gut are *constantly* shedding tissue and regenerating it. A papercut it is a drop in the bucket compared to those metabolic demands.   Bone, likewise, exists as a dynamic equilibrium between osteoclasts, which are constantly destroying it, and osteoblasts, which are constantly making new bone. You can think of healing as osteoblasts temporarily getting the upper hand. There are plenty of situations where unwanted new bone is produced (eg osteoarthritis) with no impact on metabolism or healing elsewhere.

The guess there is that a brain injury causes more of them to circulate through your blood stream, leading to a better ""cleaning"" of the fracture site, and faster healing. "
65669	0	a	Dietitians will frequently calculate increased calorie requirements for our patients in the ICU based on the etiology of their disease for example trauma, infection, burns, etc.   Source, am a doc. 
65670	0	a	In relation to your curiosity, I find this to be fun and relevant information.  Exercising is a form of injury infliction,  when you exercise you essentially create micro tears and muscle breakdown.  Your body then uses calories on top of your basal metabolic rate to facilitate the muscle damage repair.  Not only do you repair this muscle but it grows more robust to prevent that same injury from occurring again from the same amount of work output.  Even your bones will grow thicker and more robust in response to the torque applied to the structures.  (Best prevention and reversal for osteoporosis is weight lifting anything even a couple pounds heavier than what your body is used to). All this burns calories due to self inflicted micro injuries.   Edit: Yeah,  I like biology not grammar
65671	0	a	That's pretty much always a better idea simply because opening a blister introduces an infection risk.
65672	0	a	Are we talking like 4000 calories/day, or like 12,000?
65673	0	a	Am surgical/trauma chief resident, I can answer this.   Looks like most answers are vague.  So there are equations out there to calculate what a persons basal metabolic rate is, ie calories needed to lay in bed and breath.  For the average person this is somewhere around 1800 calories or so.    For the severe poly trauma patients and the severe sepsis (infection) patients where nutrition becomes important, they are usually bed bound, intubated, and very sick, (I'll have them on lots of meds and all sorts of crap.)  For these patients, we will typically not only increase their caloric intake from their basal metabolic rate by 30% or so, we will also make sure they are getting 2grams of protein per kilo (basically the same as recommended for weight lifters).   This is usually done through a feeding tube as they can't swallow.    There are complex methods of determining if that is adequate, it's called a metabolic cart and it measures various chemicals or proteins your body puts out to get a specific caloric need.  This is not done often, as it's difficult.  And mostly we can eyeball it with our equations and get it really close.   Literally could talk for an hour about nutrition in the super sick patient but I think you get the idea.  So calories around 2500 for the avg sized person and protein around 150 grams a day.  
65674	0	a	You'd gain 2.5 lbs of fat PER DAY on a 12,000 calorie diet even assuming an extremely high (3000 kcal) TDEE  EDIT: this was just a little joke based on the rule of thumb that adding 3,500 calories to your weekly total energy expenditure, you should expect to gain about a pound of body weight (fat or muscle). It's not actually possible to put on multiple pounds of mass in a 24 hour period. RIP your glycemic index if you ate like this, though.  
65675	0	a	Absolutely. Popping pimples can run the risk of rupturing the wrong way and sending some very nasty bacteria right into your body. If that happens, most likely outcome is just making it worse/heal slower, but there could certainly be a worse infection.
65676	0	a	Your body doesn't actually absorb the whole 12,000 calories, right?  In addition to some other things I can't remember, I recall that insoluble fiber also regulates calories absorbed.  
65677	0	a	That's why so many professional athletes (especially football players) gain so much weight when they retire. That 8000 calorie a day appetite doesn't just go away overnight. 
65678	0	a	It also accounts for the concerns when an athlete shows up after the off-season 10-20 pounds heavier. While the extra weight may affect that athlete's performance, it more importantly indicates that they were slacking on training in the offseason.
65679	0	a	There are generally a few reasons.  One of the biggest being that higher altitude means thinner atmosphere and less resistance on the plane.   There's also the fact that terrain is marked by sea level and some terrains may be much higher above sea level than the takeoff strip and they need to be able to clear those with a lot of room left over.  Lastly, another good reason is simply because they need to be above things like insects and most types of birds.  Because of the lower resistance, at higher altitudes, the plane can almost come down to an idle and stay elevated and moving so it also helps a lot with efficiency.   Edit:  Forgot to mention that weather plays its part as well since planes don't have to worry about getting caught up in the lower atmosphere where things like rain clouds and such form.
65680	0	a	Pilot here,  We can start by forgetting about piston aircraft that don't have any great benefits going above 10,000 feet compared to say 5,000 feet.   Turbo-prop aircraft (Q400 or ATR-72) usually cruise around 30,000 since they have a benefit of the prop biting into a bit of a thicker atmosphere vs. a higher and thinner atmosphere  Jet turbine aircraft (737, 320, Cseries) leans itself out as the go higher: air:fuel ratio becomes most efficient. A rich vs. a lean engine in a piston aircraft can go from a 12:1 air to fuel ratio to an 8:1 fuel ratio in a few thousand feet and usually cannot get better than that.   All other factors like greater fuel efficiency (fuel burns can be cut in half to 1/4 of lower alt. burns), drift-down time (Gimli glider), greater radio reception and radar guidance, obstacle avoidance, but mainly its turbine performance (concorde cruised at 60,000), not friction avoidance.  One misconception is the friction factor. A headwind of +5kt at a higher altitude will not outweigh the benefits of less friction at a greater altitude. Oxygen (atmosphere) drops off a lot after 12,000 ft.  I've changed cruising altitude from FL 19,000 to 13,000 ft to gain another 30 kts.  
65681	0	a	u/stoplightrave us partially right. However, one reason no one has mentioned is that most want to travel as fast as possible. The higher you go the less drag and thus the faster you go with least amount of effort.
65682	0	a	Thinner air actually makes an engine less efficient, but this is offset by increased airspeed in a turbojet engine due to an increase in ram air. A high bypass turbo fan or turboprop still loses efficiency due to the thinner air. Efficiency is primarily gained by the much much colder air temperatures at higher altitudes, which more than offsets the reduction in thrust due to less dense air. I can’t recall exactly why this is but the lower temperature is the biggest reason turbine engines are best at high altitudes.   Also, because of the thinner air, for a given indicated airspeed, true airspeed (airspeed through an air mass) and subsequently groundspeed, increases as your altitude increases. In the end you go faster for less fuel as you get higher, up to a certain altitude. Then the temperature stops dropping and you run into increased costs to keep the cabin pressurized to below 10,000 feet. IIRC, this is somewhere in the 40,000 feet range. 
65683	0	a	There is also the matter of having a safety cushion. It really doesn't matter if a plane crashes from 5000 or 30000 feet once you hit the ground. Dead is dead. However, when something goes wrong, falling from 30000 feet gives you a lot more time to fix things than falling from 5000. It's like how ships will often avoid land in a storm - the danger zone is where sky or water meet land, so stay away from that.
65684	0	a	"My pilot friend had this to say: ""So, turbine engines are most efficient at hotter temperature differentials.  At 33k feet it's -50 outside, and the engines are up around 600.  The lower drag coupled with the lower oxygen means lower fuel burn.""  Edit to add another comment: ""My engines (on a 737) burn around 1500 lbs per hour at idle at sea level. At cruise at 38k feet, it's around 2200"""
65685	0	a	Winds, when they are going the right direction, are more like an added bonus than the primary reason aircraft fly high. Airlines will route aircraft to take advantage of tailwinds to some extent, but sometimes they have no choice but to fly right into 100kt+ headwinds, and they will usually do that rather than flying lower because of the reduced drag at high altitudes. Also, wind speeds tend to top out around 35k feet and actually drop off as you get up into the stratosphere.
65686	0	a	"""more efficient"" is the wrong way to describe this, or at least it's not the turbofans that become more efficient, it's the entire vehicle becomes more efficient due to less drag on the airframe. The engines get less efficient by themselves, but it's a net-positive effect all the way up to around 45,000 ft. At those altitudes, a 500mph aircraft has the drag of a 230 mph airplane, which is 1/4 of the drag."
65687	0	a	Case in point, for anyone wondering if this really happens: in 1985, the pilots of China Airlines flight 006 reacted incorrectly to an engine failure and allowed the thrust imbalance to turn the plane upside down. The plane fell, turning over and over, for _5.7 miles_ straight down before the pilots managed to recover and land the heavily damaged aircraft in San Francisco. No one died, but had they been flying at a lower altitude, everyone on board would have been toast.
65688	0	a	Assuming you travel at the same speed, yes.  You have to travel faster to generate the lift.  Which is good!
65689	0	a	The engines need oxygen to work so there's a limit to how high you can fly
65690	0	a	Several reasons:  1. Engines require oxygen to work. At high altitudes, there is almost no oxygen. Designing an engine that can work on the ground and also at 60,000ft+ is very difficult and expensive.  2. Above approximately 60,000ft, the pressure is so low that oxygen masks would not be enough to survive if the aircraft depressurized - all the passengers would have to wear spacesuits.  3. To pressurize the inside of the plane at higher altitudes, the pressure differential between the inside and outside of the plane is greater. Since the fuselage will be under more stress, it will have to be heavier and stronger.  4. Emergency descents from higher altitudes take a much longer time.  5. At higher altitudes, solar radiation is much stronger and can increase the likelihood of skin cancer, unless you black out all the windows.  6. As you increase in altitude, the plane’s stall speed (minimum speed it can fly at) will increase. This means that the higher you fly, the faster you must fly also. Eventually, if you go high enough, the plane will have to be traveling supersonic in order to not stall. Designing planes to fly supersonic is very complicated and expensive.
65691	0	a	Drag at 500 mph @ 45000 ft = Drag at 230 mph @ ???   Is it at sea level air?
65692	0	a	> for 5.7 miles straight down  This didn't sound right to me so I checked but yeah [30,000 feet = 5.682 miles](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=30,000+feet+to+miles)  
65693	0	a	Stalling at high altitude isn't much of a real safety risk, most aircraft with a well trained pilot can easily recover from a stall given enough altitude, stalling at low altitude where there's no time for recovery is infinitely more dangerous.  Stalling at pattern altitude on landing approach or shortly after takeoff is a major cause of aircraft fatalities, stalling at high altitude is almost never fatal.  As a matter of fact every student pilot will deliberately stall their aircraft at high altitude as part of their training so they become familiar with the plane's stall behavior.  The mitigation of weather related issues at higher altitudes more than makes up for the added risks.  Cabin depressurization is a rare event in an airliner.    Flying in the dense lower atmosphere would greatly limit speed, require much more power and fuel, allow much less time to react to in-flight emergencies (such as an engine out), subject the aircraft to dangerous up and down drafts when crossing mountainous areas, force aircraft to fly in bumpy choppy air, that would be uncomfortable and stress the airframe, due to convection currents from the warm earth's surface,  and crowd all air traffic (including smaller aircraft moving at much slower speeds) into a smaller space where collisions would be much more likely.
65694	0	a	The plane was actually flying at 41,000 feet, as it was a 747 on a long-haul trans-Pacific flight. So not quite that close, but still bad. Basically, the plane was flying in cloud cover and when the plane started turning over, the pilots suffered from spatial disorientation and weren't able to figure out which way was up. When the plane dropped out of the cloud layer at 11,000 feet and they could see the horizon again, they were able to recover.
65695	0	a	Correct. Drag increases with the Square of velocity, multiplied by the coefficient of drag. Big and bulky aircraft like airliners will have a higher coefficient of drag than a fighter jet, for example.   It's the same reason a 140hp Honda can (eventually) get up to 120mph, but it takes a super car with hundreds more hp and an aerodynamic design to get to 200mph.
65696	0	a	This is why as a pilot in training, they teach you emergency procedures and disorientation exercises. One being wearing smoky glasses and putting your head down between your legs while the instructor moves the plane around like a crazy person until you are thoroughly confused as to which way is up. On command they will give you control of the airplane and tell you to get control of the plane. Could be straight down, sideways etc. Needless to say, it's not fun and a change of clothes is sometimes required. If you are going to get sick, this will be the time!
65697	0	a	The main reason why it is so enforced in pilots, VFR and especially IFR, that you should pay attention to your instruments and attitude indicator.   Don't trust your senses! Don't fly by the seat of your pants. Don't rely on the outside world to guide you. Trust your instruments no matter what and you'll make it out alive without a hitch. Unless, of course, your instruments disagree with each other.      
65698	0	a	Isn't that why they always tell you to watch and trust the instruments (artificial horizon being one)?
65699	0	a	The engine failed first, so no failures were caused by the fall.  They kept the plane on autopilot while diagnosing it, but the autopilot wasn't set up to control the plane's rudder, so with the asymmetric thrust the plane eventually rolled and stalled.  After that it began to fall and the pilots assumed the artificial horizon had also malfunctioned as they attempted to correct the plane's plunge - because it told them it was inverted and all that.  The captain brought the remaining three engines to idle to slow the plunge, but miscommunication happened and the flight engineer didn't see this, saw the engine performance roll back to idle and attempted to get the engines back to full throttle, but the aircraft was so far out of limits that they responded slowly so he thought they'd failed.  Eventually the plane began to break up and sustained damage to it's tail from aerodynamic stresses, *but* then it came out of the clouds and the pilots were finally able to correct the fall and land,despite the damage. 
65700	0	a	[Here's what some of that testing looks like](https://hips.hearstapps.com/pop.h-cdn.co/assets/16/02/1452895628-wing3.gif). Those wings aren't going anywhere.
65701	0	a	When the pilots became spatially disoriented—without a visual reference point to determine which way was up—the organs in the inner ear that detect their position in space stopped working properly. It became difficult for them to actual feel the plane's violent rolls and steep dive, so they thought their artificial horizons were malfunctioning.
65702	0	a	Yes.  Without the instruments, it's very easy to be oriented incorrectly without the pilot or passengers having any physical sensation of it.  You can do a calm, controlled flight right into the ground.  For example, [JFK, Jr. and his wife died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Jr.#Death) because he was not rated for instrument flight (VFR only), but he was flying at dusk.  
65703	0	a	This has always blown my mind - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9pvG_ZSnCc  It's pretty short, but the tl;dr; is that he rolls an aircraft without spilling his drink, and then rolls the aircraft while pouring a cup of tea.  Now imagine this video but with pitch black outside the window.  Or flat gray.  You'd experience the same 1G as that drink does, and without some external reference, it's entirely possible to go through that roll without ever realizing you're upside-down.  You know the feeling when you corner a little too fast in a car, and you can feel you're being pulled to the side?  Now black out the windows - how do you distinguish between being pulled to the side in a corner, or the vehicle being on its side?  The only difference between being pull back into your seat because you're accelerating, and being pulled back into your seat because you're flying straight upwards, so the force of gravity is coming from your back - is your trust in which direction the ground is in.  In a car, you can trust that if the wheels weren't pointing at the ground, you'd know about it by now.  In an aircraft, this trust is broken.  This is what's happening when we talk about a manoeuvre being 1G, or 2G, etc.  That the manoeuvre creates a force on you equal to one, two, etc times the force of gravity.  If that force isn't in the same direction as the floor, your butt (okay, ears) starts lying about which way the floor is.  If your eyes can't add any more reliable data to the situation, instant disorientation.
65704	0	a	A wave is typically measured by frequency and amplitude. What aspects of gravity do these two properties affect, and are these aspects explainable/understandable to non-physicists?
65705	0	a	I posted this on Facebook last night, and will leave it here in case anyone finds it helpful:  ---  Gravitational waves are one of the last major, unconfirmed predictions of general relativity, a theory which does a pretty amazing job of explaining gravity. General relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter. Gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around. They are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces.  But because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism, we can see light all the time (just look around!) while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly (absurdly) precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation. Rumors are flying that LIGO, just such a system of lasers and detectors, has found a gravitational wave signal, probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other (because that's the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect).  This would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there, rather than reveal something new and shocking about the Universe. Think the Higgs boson a few years ago. It would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out *not* to be there: general relativity has worked extremely well so far, and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s, which won the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. LIGO's *direct* detection would undoubtedly be Nobel-worthy, too; the only question is whether it would happen this year.  This is exciting because a) it's direct, rather than indirect, confirmation that these things are there, and b) they'll open up a whole new window onto the Universe. Pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation, from visible light to X-rays, the ultraviolet, microwaves, what have you. Starting now we'd have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos, delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes.  So all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow, ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics. Or they could just be fucking with us.
65706	0	a	Are there any currently accepted theories that will be eventually discarded as a result ?
65707	0	a	EDIT: Haha, I work at MIT and the professors who have to teach classes right now are really pissed, they want to watch the announcements!  As expected, there’s already quite a bit of confusion and misinformation in this megathread, so I’ll try to clear things up:  &nbsp;  **What are gravitational waves?**  In order to understand gravitational waves, it’s first important to have an understanding of how forces and fields work. We’ll first take a look at something more familiar - the electromagnetic field. (note: this is simplified to avoid writing a textbook):  The electromagnetic field actually consists of 2 fields: the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (B). The electric field is generated by particles with *electric charge*, such as electrons (-1 charge) and protons (+1 charge). Here’s a picture of the electric field generated by 2 such charges:  &nbsp;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_charges_plus_minus_thumb.svg  &nbsp;  As you can see in the picture, the convention is that electric field lines come *out* of positive charges and go *into* negative charges.  If you already have an E field and you put a charge in it, the charge will feel a force according to the simple relation (from Coulomb’s Law):  F = E*q  where F is the force, E is the electric field, and q is the charge. This force has a direction - for positive charges it points in the same direction as the field lines, for negative charges it points backwards (since q is negative).  Now, what does this have to do with gravitational waves? Well, let me ask you the following question: what happens if I have 2 charges, A and B, far apart from each other, and I suddenly move charge A?  1) The E field changes instantly, with charge B immediately “seeing” the new position of charge A.  2) The E field changes first at charge A, and then the change propagates outward until charge B “sees” the change a while later.  &nbsp;  http://i.stack.imgur.com/gA6FS.gif  &nbsp;  As you can see, the answer is 2. Changes in the electric field *radiate* outwards at a constant speed - the speed of light. In fact, this radiation IS light - our eyes are actually super-sensitive E&B field sensors that pick up these ripples and translate them into images of the world!  &nbsp;  Most importantly for our purposes, this principle of changes *radiating* outwards at the speed of light is **universal** for all fields and forces in the universe. Including gravity. The caveat being that the gravitational field is incredibly weak compared to the E&B fields, so you need to have incredibly **huge** masses moving around extremely violently, and incredibly **sensitive** detectors to pick up their movements.  The biggest masses in our universe are Black Holes. The most violent events in our universe are black holes colliding with each other. And LIGO is the incredibly sensitive detector designed to detect them!  We’re almost done! The last question is: what do we expect the gravitational waves to look like? And as a corollary, why do black holes collide in the first place?  Well, most of the black hole collisions are going to happen in binary star systems - systems where you had 2 huge stars orbiting each other that at the end of their lives become black holes, still in orbit. But why would they collide? Why not just keep orbiting forever?  Well, massive objects orbiting each other radiate gravitational waves. Those waves carry energy, and that energy has to come from somewhere - in this case, it comes from the orbital energy. So over a very long time, the orbits slowly collapse, the objects slowly orbiting closer and closer to each other. As this happens, the *orbital frequency* increases - the time it takes to complete an orbit gets shorter and shorter. This is a universal principle of gravity - if you look at our Solar System, you’ll see that Mercury orbits much faster than Earth, while Pluto is much slower.  So, as 2 black holes spiral towards each other, we expect to see a **chirp** - gravitational waves increasing in frequency and intensity, rising in a final shriek as the black holes collide and merge.  &nbsp;  **What is LIGO?**  Even with black holes colliding to make gravitational waves, the ripples produced are still incredibly weak, requiring the ability to detect changes on the length scale of 1/1000th the diameter of a proton or less. So a very amazing detector is required.  LIGO is basically an extremely sensitive distance-measuring device, called an interferometer. The way this works is the following:  You start with a laser beam, then you split it into 2 equal beams (typically using a half-silvered mirror that reflects 1/2 of the beam and lets the other 1/2 through) and send them down tunnels at 90 degree angles. When they get to the end of the tunnel they get bounced back by a mirror. When the beams return to you, you recombine them into a single beam and they *interfere*. Depending on how far each beam travelled, this interference can be either *destructive* or *constructive* - meaning the beams can either cancel each other out, or they can reinforce each other and get even brighter.  At LIGO, they designed the beams so that the interference is completely destructive, meaning that no light arrives at their detector. But, when a gravitational wave comes in, it distorts spacetime, changing the lengths of the beams, and they no longer perfectly cancel out! Thus, a light signal appears at the detector.  I strongly suggest you watch the following video, which has a good visual representation of the process (around 1:30):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzZgFKoIfQI  &nbsp;  **Why is this so damn exciting?!**  So many reasons! The incredible technical achievement - measuring changes down to 1 part in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. The long-awaited confirmation of gravitational waves, which is a HUGE deal in itself. Perhaps most of all, the fact that this opens up an entirely new method of astronomy, one that ultimately will allow us to probe the most extreme densities and energies that exist in our Universe! Finally, this result gives us some confidence that we’ll eventually be successful in measuring the gravitational waves of the Big Bang, and learning about the fundamental origins of the universe.  tl;dr - There are no real tl;drs in science, and why would you want one? It’s worth it to try and understand cool things like this!
65708	0	a	For anyone still confused about what exactly gravitational waves are, [Piled Higher and Deeper (PhD Comics) has a fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GbWfNHtHRg) explaining what they are and how we can detect them.   In short, gravitational waves are produced whenever masses accelerate, changing their distortion of spacetime. Anything with mass/energy can create these waves, but since gravity is very weak only the most massive of objects produce detectable waves. We (currently) rely upon the fact that the speed of light is constant to detect gravitational waves on Earth. If a wave passes between our detectors, it will either stretch or compress the distance between two points, thus changing the total traversal time for a laser beam.  The detectors themselves are [laser interferometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry) and are large L-shaped constructions with each arm extending for 4km. The US-based LIGO project has two facilities near Livingston, LA, and Richland, WA. The detector takes advantage of the phase change a gravitational wave will cause in a laser beam. 
65709	0	a	This event apparently released 3 solar masses worth of energy.    If that sentence sounds weird, remember E=mc^(2), which means energy and mass are interchangeable.  So to figure out how much energy that is, you have to take 3 times a solar mass (2&times;10^30 kg) and multiply it by the speed of light (300,000,000 m/s) squared, which is an awfully big number:  * 5.4&times;10^47 Joules * 1.3&times;10^41 kg or 66 billion solar masses of TNT equivalent (**A typical galaxy made out of TNT**) * 2.2&times;10^34 kg or 11,000 solar masses of thermonuclear explosive * 5000 Type 1a supernovae * 100 hypernovae  A sphere of lithium deuteride thermonuclear explosive that massive would be 36 million km across, and isn’t even capable of exploding because it is so heavy it would immediately collapse into an 11,000 solar mass black hole.  But this was a release of gravitational energy, not light, so we never saw a thing, just felt the slightest ripple when it distorted spacetime as it passed by.

So many things have been discovered and created at a time no practical application was possible and now we can't live without.  With that being said, possible practical application for this gem is marvelous. From LIGO:  > In conclusion, we will never be able to commercialize or weaponize gravitational waves themselves.  However, they will carry information to us about some of the most extreme environments in the Universe which we can use as a laboratory for environments we cannot create here on Earth.  This information can tell us more about how the physics around us works in subtle ways that can have profound implications.  What those are are yet to be seen.  That's the exciting thing about science - you never really know the full potential of new discoveries until after the fact.   EDIT: Sorry, folks. I've meant to say people that ask this question in a derisive manner. Of course, curiosity as to its practical application in real life is, of course, welcome.
65711	0	a	They kept this really hush hush.  I have a friend that works at LIGO on theory side. He had no idea that they had measured it in September. I even asked him about it in January when whispers started up.  First confirmation he heard was a few hours ago.
65712	0	a	Is there any concept of directionality with gravitational waves like there is with e.g. light and sound waves? If LIGO detects a disturbance, will it also be able to tell us where that disturbance originated from or are we dependent on other detectors to get that sort of information? 
65713	0	a	So in order to make gravitational waves you need to shake something really massive really fast. In the case of two inspiraling black holes, the amplitude is related to how hard they are accelerating in their orbit, and the frequency is related to the period of the orbit.  This is why inspiraling binaries have a gravitational wave 'chirp' - as they come closer in their orbit the frequency increases as they orbit faster and faster, and the amplitude increases as well.   If a wave passes through you, it will strain you a bit, effectively squeezing and stretching you. The amount of the squeeze is related to the amplitude, the frequency of the wave is just the frequency of the squeezing. It's this tiny wavey squeezing that LIGO was designed to measure.

65716	0	a	No.  A direct detection will only confirm general relativity.  However, if we start seeing weird signals in the future, this may lead to modified theories of GR.

You shouldn't deride them for asking about the practical application. Imagine you ran into a homeless shelter and told everyone you discovered gravitational waves. Nobody would care because they have bigger problems.  If you want support for your science projects from everyday people then you need to talk to them in everyday language. In what way might this solve their everyday problems?"
65719	0	a	Think sound waves - each detector cannot tell what direction the signal is coming from, but by using 2 detectors we can try to triangulate it.  Additionally, both the detectors and the sources are somewhat directional (more sensitive in some directions than others).  This helps narrow down the source, but until a 3rd or 4th detector comes online, it can't be precisely determined.
65720	0	a	> So in order to make gravitational waves you need to shake something really massive really fast  In order to make waves, or waves we can detect?  I guess I don't understand why the waves would only exist past a certain threshold. If I drop a pebble in the ocean it makes a very small wave, but a wave nonetheless.  
65721	0	a	Yes, but a little different from electromagnetic waves.  A gravitational wave distorts space in such a way that a circle perpendicular to the direction the wave travels gets distorted into an oval -- first compressed horizontally and elongated vertically, and then compressed vertically and elongated horizontally, and back and forth between those two situations.
65722	0	a	"What really blew my mind was when on the press conference they told that the amount of energy released on these gravitational waves from the black holes mergin was equal to 50 times (if I remember correctly, could be wrong) the output of all the stars on ENTIRE universe. Only for 20ms though. And the energy was ""only"" equal to complete annihilation of 3 stars the size of the sun.   It happened 1.3 billion lightyears away, and yet we could still detect it here on earth. It'd be really interesting to know what kind of effects the gravitational waves would have on for example earth, if this would have happened 1 lightyear away and if we'd ignore all the other apocalyptic stuff propably occuring. Would it be bit like some kind of uniform earthquakelike occurence, or would we simply warp a bit without ever realizing that anything special happened?"

The Michelson–Morley experiment was done in 1887 to try and detect the differences in the speed of light in perpendicular directions, in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether (""aether wind""). In 1905, Einstein published a paper first bringing up time dilation, which takes the speed of light as constant and deduces some weird shit that reality should conform to. During 1907-1915 he develops General Relativity, which explains how gravity plays into this. And now, in 2016, a 100 years later; the dude's scientific deductions are still coming true in exciting ways. And, hilariously, the idea of looking at light going in perpendicular directions is again the experiment being done, except with an entirely different outlook on what is expected. What's ironic is we can look at this now as ""listening"" to the ""ether""."

This would have big repercussion in military aviation and also in astronomy I'm sure since we could detect objects without having to rely on the EM spectrum. Depending on sensibility of this, I could see application in meteorology also.   Edit: astronomy > astrology
65734	0	a	As a flood engineer i wish i came here sooner to answer a few questions.   But the main thing is that a number of vectors will remove the water due to gravity.   Namely sewers, ground drains, good old evaporation, lay of the land, local ground geology, tidal differences to name a few.  Once the hurricane has passed though then levels will drop fairly quickly.  The biggest problem will be both the environmental (mobilised sewage etc...) and physical property damage that has occured.  Lots of standing water means mozzies and vermin.  Contaminated waters means polluted ground water sources, damaged agriculture infrastructure, dead livestock, crops wiped out and quarantined/destroyed  (certain crops absorb harmful nasties).   Infrastructure wise lots of work gutting out the drainage system and clearing hurricane damage will take place. Damaged electricity/phone/gas infrastructure will need checking too.    Now let's talk about the houses that are damaged.   There are typical damage assessments that can be done but there are 2 typical factors that ultimately determine damage costs and severity - the depth of water and the time water stays around (ok and type of building materials used)  Anything typically above 400mm for a day or 2 means that the lower floor needs gutting and requires a complete rework.  Now think of this in terms of demands locally.  Every homeless person will  need rehousing, every house will require skilled trades to repair them(and they WILL be in  demand). It will take years for all affected properties to be repaired by all trades.  But as a starter for then why not google what happened during hurricane katrina or the 2005 flooding carlisle in the UK.  Some of the stats are just mindblowing and heartbreaking.  Ps also google the lake levels rises during hurricane Katrina due to the low air pressure alone.  It makes for amazing reading.

65735	0	a	"I'm a semester away from graduating with a degree in soil science, so I'll answer this as it pertains to soil.  The most important concept to understand before I delve into this is that everything moves through soil via water. This includes nutrients, pollutants, minerals, etc.  The large scale scope of a flood like this is pollution and soil erosion. When soil is flooded to the point that water can no longer infiltrate, it begins transporting the top 2 layers of soil. This is the organic layer (such as leaf litter) and the surface layer (topsoil). These are the two most nutrient rich layers of soil, and often the most polluted (by pesticides, foreign chemicals, or trash). This is not good for a few reasons:  1. The main source of nutrients have now been stripped from the plants.  2. The sub-surface layers are exposed, and from what I understand about Texan soil, this is mostly clay.  3. Pollutants are now being transported and dumped into waterways or varying soil environments.   Some of the nutrients will be returned to soil elsewhere, but most of these nutrients will flow to waterways and into the ocean. This will not be good for the Gulf, as it is already hypoxic (lack of dissolved oxygen due to nutrient runoff. Essentially, the large amount of nutrients results in algae blooms which deprives the water of oxygen). The reduction of plant matter will also reduce the stability of the soil, meaning it will be more likely to erode in the future.   The second portion of this is that clay now becomes the surface layer. Because clay is so small, it takes water significantly longer to move through the soil profile, thus lowering the hydraulic conductivity. This means water runoff will now become a large problem in the affected areas for months or years to come.  The third portion is pollutants. Chemicals and trash are now being transported to different soils and waterways. Not good.  As for the smaller scope impacts, soil horizons will become disrupted. Soil stability will be negatively impacted. Nutrients will be forced through the horizons quicker, leaving a deprived soil. Many soil microbes (the most important indicator of soil health, depending on who you ask) will be killed off.  So, yeah. It's disastrous for soil and the overall environmental health of the area.  EDIT: Also, as for plants, many can survive being submerged for up to a weekish. Many cannot. The flooding will inhibit root nutrient uptake, which will result in decay. Water-logged roots are also more susceptible to organisms that specialize in root-rot.        EDIT2: /u/BadBadger42 asked a question about highly expansive clays. These are what we call shrink-swell soils. The clay fraction is expanded in area when water-logged, which causes extra stress on infrastructure. This is the leading cause of flooding basements, and why many buildings in Texas do not have basements. Taking a look at [this soil map of Texas](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/nrcs144p2_000979.jpg), most of the area effected is Vertisol. I'm sure you've all noticed a vertisol before, when it dries it looks like [this](http://geotechfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cracked-soil-texas.jpg). The ""swell"" of the soil is caused by the micropores between the clay particles becoming over-saturated - and when it dries (""shrinks"") those cracks are left behind. Vertisol is the shrink-swell classification of soil. I would imagine that the effects of shrink-swell on infrastructure will be exacerbated by the flooding.  "
65736	0	a	I'm a Professional Engineer in Pennsylvania who consults in stormwater management.  Q1: Water will recede just like any other storm, it will just take MUCH longer. In an urban setting like Houston, it will flow into storm drains along the curb, into small pipes like 18” diameter, then those feed into larger pipes like 48” or even concrete box culverts which might be 15’ wide by 4’ high (the possible dimensions are endless). Those large pipes/culverts drain into the streams and rivers. Everything eventually keeps draining downhill to the ocean, bay, bayou, etc.   Q2: In general, this probably won’t change much regarding the landscape. It will look like the same place as it did before, except structures around main drainage channels may have washed away.  Q3: No permanent lakes or rivers will be made. Everything will drain naturally in a matter of days. If there is a low spot that doesn’t drain by gravity to a storm sewer, channel, stream, etc., that depression could hold water longer but it will eventually infiltrate into the soil and/or evaporate.  Up here in Pennsylvania, we design pipes/culverts to carry up to the 100-year storm which would be like 8” of rain in 24 hours. Not sure what they design for down south, but their 100-year storm is probably like 12”+ of rain in 24 hours. This hurricane is dumping 4+ feet in some areas so there’s no way to drain that much water very quickly. Just have to wait.
65737	0	a	I Googled this yesterday cause I was afraid to ask on here. I am curious of the actual paths it takes to get to the gulf. The only thing I can imagine is how a tsunami rapidly recedes back to the ocean but I know that isn't how this works. 
65738	0	a	I would like to piggyback on this question if I could...  Would draining the 2 reservoirs they're having problems with (the Addicks and Barker) before the hurricane hit not have kept the water out of the Bayou and out of those neighborhoods close by?  Why would they not have done this beforehand?

65740	0	a	Differences in atmospheric pressure DO NOT appreciably contribute to storm surge.  Storm surge is wind-driven water.  What makes it bad/worse is the shape of the continental shelf (whereas shallow = bad) and also the rise in elevation of the adjacent coastal land (how much elevation per mile as you go inland.)  [Here, read up everyone.](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/surge_intro.pdf)  Pay special attention to page 2, upper left.

65742	0	a	"For what has been dubbed as the ""Gulf of Mexico dead zone"", it's a bit of a mixed bag in terms of how storm-related freshwater inflow from the Mississippi plume (and some influence from the Atchaflaya and other rivers) impacts these hypoxic/anoxic conditions. During the summer, it has been observed that disruptive storms (i.e., hurricanes) do a pretty good job at mixing the water column and breaking up stratification (a principle component for the development of the dead zone); this mixing appears to have lingering effects by drastically reducing the size of the dead zone even after stratification re-emerges. Conversely, these winds may enhance upwelling- and downwelling-favorable conditions that simply shift the location and shape of the dead zone and not help to alleviate it at all.   Another interesting component in all of this is the probable shift in species distribution of phytoplankton; the silica-rich freshwater inflow would replenish a Si-limited system and allow silicifying algae (e.g., diatoms) to bloom again (as opposed to dinoflagellates and other phytoplankton that are commonly associated with harmful blooms). What is interesting (and somewhat cool if not for the hypoxia) is that this has pretty substantial biological, chemical, and geological consequences in both short- (intra-year) and long-term (decadal or more) time-scales.

65743	0	a	Basically. Water is gonna follow gravity to the lowest spot. The lowest spot could be a pond, lake, or, for the majority of water, the ocean. Water will follow rivers and gullies until it reaches the ocean/lake/whatever the low spot is.  Problem with a hurricane is the storm surge, which forces the ocean to rise into the coastline. I know the shear wind force can push it but there may be other factors (for reference, put water on a plate and blow on it. It will move towards the area you blow). So the ocean, where the rainwater normally flows, is now several feet higher, meaning those rivers/streams/gullies are going to stop flowing once they reach equilibrium with the ocean.

65745	0	a	I believe you want to look into the storm surge. The section labeled [The Storm Surge and Flooding of New Orleans](https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html) is an example of what mitchanium mentioned.   Reading that section says not all that height is air pressure alone, some of it is water pushed by wind and the result of water pushed into enclosed spaces, but the [model](https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html) shows something like 10-12 feet of water on the southern shore of the lake. Whether it was just air pressure of a combination of that and wind, that is still a wall of water created by nothing more than the movement of air.  
65746	0	a	Honestly it's mainly the lay of the land thay dictates where the water will go.  By that i mean that if land contours or people  prevent flooding to that area then that inevitably means flooding somehwere else.  The reality though is that most areas are only protected to a certain degree (and economically justified {cost benefit analysis} projects) and most are reactively responded to as opposed to proactively responded to.  Now don't roast your local government or council for lack of action because the world really has been impacted by global warming.  Eg for any business case or flood scheme that i propose in the UK i have to factor in  20% additional damage due to climate change.....and trust me storm intensities have got worse here.   It's crazy times folks. 
65747	0	a	I saw either an article or another post on Reddit somewhere that over the last 20 or so years, Houston has been improving its water drainage system by creating storm drains under any new road construction. The system helps divert water away from homes and instead floods the streets (since it is safer there). Those incredible pictures from Houston interstates are at least partly a result of that flood control system. It is also a reason why they did not issue an evacuation order, because people would be sitting in traffic while the water rose, resulting in unnecessary deaths.

65750	0	a	Lol. Thats not rude at all. I get this question more times than you can imagine.   My interest in soil started when I was a kid. I loved digging. I loved looking at all the critters scramble about when I dug them up. I liked the different colors I found in the ground when I was on family vacations.  But I never took it as a serious desire until college. I was going to be a civil engineer until I took an intro to soil science course. I quickly realized I loved how all of the sciences are incorporated into it - soil physics, soil chemistry, and soil biology are all equally important.   I guess it's hard to explain why I enjoy it so much. If you like lab work, you can do lab work with soil. If you enjoy being in the field, you can do field work with soil. It reaches into more areas of study than I previously imagined. Agriculture, hydrology, landscape management, engineering, and urban design just to name a few.

65754	0	a	Not really. It causes lakes to bulge upward because there's not as much air pressure acting on the water, just gravity. Essentailly, the water spreads out vertically.  A really bad example that still gets the point across is putting a peep in a vacuum chamber. Except instead of marshmallow, it's water that can still flow.

Almost any job can be rewarding if you push harder, seek out opportunities for improvement, and... dare I say it... dig deeper.
65756	0	a	The density of the water remains pretty much unchanged from the change in pressure. Water is often considered incompressible because no naturally occuring pressure differentiall will cause water to expand to a significant degree. What will change is the actual mass of water in the lake. The pressure will draw more water to the low pressure area if the lake is connected to another body of water, the ocean in the case of katrina or from the other side of the lake of it is big enough. This is like sucking water through a straw. The water moves up the straw but drains it from another source. Also, regardless of whether not the lake is attached to another source, the water will go up simply because the low air pressure means there can be less water vapor pressure (dryer air). So the air outside of the eye is very wet (obviously) but the air in the eye is not. The decreased pressure means thinner air and thinner air cannot store as much gaseous water. So the air that was previously very humid in the higher pressure areas can no longer hold all of its water resulting in the water vapor condensing back into a liquid. This isn't on the scale of rain, but enough to contribute towards the amount of water in a lake.

The nose warms up and moistens  air before it enters the trachea in the winter and has an air conditioning effect in the summer.  The nose is the first line of defense before foreign particles can be inhaled into the respiratory tract – large particles are captured by hairs and smaller ones get caught in mucus.  In that way, it can be thought of as an organ of the immune system, since it is responsible for draining the sinuses.  The endings of the olfactory nerves go through the roof of the nasal cavity; if there was no protection and just open orifices on the front of the face, you would basically have very little between raw exposed cranial nerve endings and the outside world.  Lastly, the shape of the nose changes vocal resonance and affects your voice.  Edit:  Wow, leaving for a few hours, you wouldn't expect a little comment about the nose to blow up like this, or else I would've elaborated more.  I did a little lower down, going into more detail on theories of racial/climate-related differences in nose shape and comparative anatomy of other animal noses (carotid rete).  I also agree that noses are not usually classified as immune system organs, but I just meant that it has functions with innate immunity.  And good point on helping to keep liquids out of the respiratory tract!
65758	0	a	In addition to what everyone else said there is one point that no one brought up: The shape of a human nose helps infants breathe while suckling. Other primates have protruding jaws that allow them to breathe while suckling. If we didn't have our noses we could be more prone to smothering.

Many animals have heads that point down, but with our large brains, we're not designed for that.  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2015/oct/05/sneezing-monkey-walking-fish-200-new-species-himalayas  Locals have told scientists the monkeys are easy to find because, owing to their upturned noses, water gets into their nostrils when it rains and they start sneezing. On rainy days, they sit with their heads tucked between their legs to stop the water getting up their noses.
65760	0	a	Every time this comes up, I mention the benefits of a hooded nose for swimming, but it's shot down. I get that it humidifies air for us and all that, but is there not at least something to the fact that we can go underwater while other primates can't?  Other primates have open noses, and I don't know if they live with constant respiratory issues, but I know they aren't into swimming like humans.
65761	0	a	In addition to what everyone has said, the nose plays a big role in taste, too. We can smell our food better with the nostrils right above our mouth and better detect potentially harmful (rotting or poisonous) food. 
65762	0	a	I think you may have missed mentioning the most obvious reason. The nose primarily functions to keep water out of the respiratory passages. We can't close our nose like we can our mouth, but the shape of the nose, the position and size of the nostrils, and nostril hairs themselves (which are hydrophobic), all serve to block water from entering the nasal passages.
65763	0	a	So why isn't it just two holes in the face, and internal like animals that tend to have a far better smell than us anyway?  Lots of great info but it doesn't really answer the questions about why it is shaped the way it is.
65764	0	a	It works for adults too!  If your nose was just two holes and you ended up pressing your face against something while you slept (such as a pillow, a leaf, or your mate or child), you might suffocate.  As it is, the shape of your nose keeps the area around your nostrils clear even when pressed against an object, helping you breath.

The deepness of voice = thick vocal fold muscles The nose= resonance (hypo/hypernasality)"

65769	0	a	Not really answering your question, but a quick yet important tidbit about evolution:  There is no goal for evolution, and it doesn't always produce the best and the most efficient feature in animals. Evolution occurs when random mutations help an organism or a species to survive better and reproduce. It need not be a step forward in all the characteristics of the animal, just the necessary ones that help it survive it's immediate surroundings. Also, a marginal step forward in one characteristic may itself provide a huge *net gain* in advantage for survivability and reproducibility, in spite of regression in certain other characteristics.
65770	0	a	Actually, racial differences have been studied pretty specifically pertaining to nose shape [since the 1800s](http://www.popsci.com/climate-nose-shape-evolution#page-6).  There has definitely been a correlation between flatter, broader noses and equatorial climates, and narrower, longer noses at higher latitudes.  [This study](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006616), for example, controls for genetic drift and found statistically significant differences in nose shape across cultures, varying directly with temperature and absolute humidity.  The [theory](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-shape-of-a-nose/) on this is that narrow chambers are better at insulating the air that is exchanged and warming it up, whereas broader chambers facilitate more open surface contact with greater volumes of air, allowing for more efficient cooling.

65773	0	a	Actually, from a design point of view, our bodies are not that well constructed. Our spine isn't really made for walking upright, for one. The way the nerves branch out from between vertebrae makes them extremely vulnerable to compression.  Similarly, our head is just one big point of failure. If anything happens to it, we're toast. GG, centralized nervous system.  Our circulatory system? It depends on us nearly constantly moving to function. Ever notice that when you have to sit for a while, your feet get a little sore and you wind up fidgeting​? That's because if you don't keep your muscles moving, your circulation stops. Those little movements (toes wriggling, feet shifting, etc) are what pump your blood back up to your heart.  All of it works *well enough*, but it's far from well designed. More like cobbled together and functional.

65781	0	a	Mine just retreated back into the fort with just the mental image you provided.
65782	0	a	"No, it is not.  Phones and other devices that broadcast (tablets, laptops, you name it ...) emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation. EM radiation comes in many different forms, but it is typically characterized by its frequency (or wavelength, the two are directly connected).  Most mobile devices communicate with EM signals in the frequency range running from a few hundred megahertz (MHz) to a few gigahertz (GHz).  So what happens when we're hit with EM radiation? Well, it depends on the frequency. The frequency of the radiation determines the energy of the individual photons that make up the radiation. Higher frequency = higher energy photons. If photons have sufficiently high energy, they can damage a molecule and, by extension, a cell in your body. There's no exact frequency threshold from which point on EM radiation can cause damage in this way, but 1 petahertz (PHz, or 1,000,000 GHz) is a good rough estimate. For photons that don't have this much energy, the most they can hope to achieve is to see their energy converted into heat.  Converting EM radiation into a heat is the #1 activity of a very popular kitchen appliance: The microwave oven. This device emits EM radiation with a frequency of about 2.4 GHz to heat your milk and burn your noodles (while leaving parts of the meal suspiciously cold).  The attentive reader should now say to themselves: Wait a minute! This 2.4 GHz of the microwave oven is right there between the ""few hundred MHz"" and ""few GHz"" frequency range of our mobile devices. So are our devices mini-microwave ovens?  As it turns out, 2.4 GHz is also the frequency used by many wifi routers (and devices connecting to them) (which coincidentally is the reason why poorly shielded microwave ovens can cause dropped wifi connections when active). But this is where the second important variable that determines the effects of EM radiation comes into play: intensity.  A microwave oven operates with a power of somewhere around the 1,000 W (depending on the model), whereas a router has a broadcast power that is limited (by law, in most countries) to 0.1 W. That makes a microwave oven 10,000 more powerful than a wifi router at maximum output. And mobile devices typically broadcast at even lower intensities, to conserve battery. And while microwave ovens are designed to focus their radiation on a small volume in the interior of the oven, routers and mobile devices throw their radiation out in every direction.  So, not only is EM radiation emitted by our devices not energetic enough to cause direct damage, the intensity with which it is emitted is orders of magnitude lower to cause any noticeable heating.  But to close, I would like to discuss one more source of EM radiation. A source from which we receive radiation with frequencies ranging from 100 terahertz (THz) to 1 PHz or even slightly more. Yes, that overlaps with the range of potentially damaging radiation. And even more, the intensity of this radiation varies, but can reach up to tens of W. That's not the total emitted, but the total that directly reaches a human being. Not quite microwave oven level, but enough to make you feel much hotter when exposed to it.  So what is this source of EM radiation and why isn't it banned yet? The source is none other than the Sun. (And it's probably not yet banned due to the powerful agricultural lobby.) Our Sun blasts us with radiation that is far more energetic (to the point where it can be damaging) than anything our devices produce and with far greater intensity. Even indoors, behind a window, you'll receive so much more energy from the Sun (directly or indirectly when reflected by the sky or various objects) than you do from the ensemble of our mobile devices."
65783	0	a	Here’s a handy chart from Randall Munroe (XKCD): https://xkcd.com/radiation/  You may notice that cell phones and other tech are not on this chart. This is because the radiation emitted by these devices is so weak, they are not capable of altering your cells (non-ionizing radiation). Bananas, on the other hand, do emit ionizing radiation (just a very, very, very small amount. You do not need to be worried about bananas). So you might explain to your parents that bananas are more dangerous than cell phones, and ask them if they know anyone who has died suspiciously after eating a couple bananas
65784	0	a	I feel like the whole picture hasn't been conveyed in the top comments as certain studies have found a slight correlation between the non-ionizing radiation emitted by cell phones and certain types of brain tumors. The majority of studies have shown no such correlation or a statistically inconclusive correlation. The problem with any research on this issue, as far as I understand, is that the span in which people have been heavily using cell phones is relatively short in comparison to a human lifespan. In any case, the issue isn't done and dusted and a great deal of research will be conducted on the subject as cell phone users age.  Here is a somewhat technical source that does a very good job of summing research into the issue, and also links to the few studies favoring increased risk: [https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/exposure-assessment/cellular-telephones-brain-tumors](https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/exposure-assessment/cellular-telephones-brain-tumors)  Here is a less technical fact sheet on the issue with some Q&A your parents might appreciate: [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet)  Edited for word choice on the controversial bit  Also, I certainly wouldn't stop using a cell phone over this - just wanted to point out an applicable research area that hasn't been pointed out by other commenters. 
65785	0	a	"No. Most evidence says it isn't true.  Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic (EM) radiation and the term ""radiation"" scares a lot of people, but EM radiation also includes the heat from the sun, visible light, radio waves, and x-rays. Some of these are more dangerous than others. In a lot of cases people in medicine and physics talk about ""ionizing"" and ""non-ionizing"" radiation. ""Ionizing"" radiation means that it can knock an election lose (making an ""ion"") and break a chemical bond. Since our DNA is a large molecule this type of radiation can change the structure of DNA and create errors in the DNA which can cause cancer. Non-ionizing radiation can't do this. Radio waves, and visible light are all lower energy non-ionizing radiation, while ultra violet light and x-rays are ionizing radiation.  Now, having said that, obviously enough heat will cause burns. Microwaves are non-ionizing, but enough of them can boil water and cook meat, so it isn't enough to just say that ""non-ionizing"" means that it's safe. Now a microwave oven produces 500-1000 watts of EM radiation, while a cell phone produces at most 0.7-1 watt (some old ones could go up to 3 watts, but in practice cell phones try to send a weaker signal to conserve battery life, so even the 0.7 watt is very rare). A 1000 watt light bulb will really hurt your eyes while a 1 watt bulb isn't enough to read by, and it's a similar for cell phone -- very low power doesn't appear to be a concern.  Now, one other problem is that In addition to the strong chemical bonds (e.g. ionic and covalent), there are also weaker bonds (e.g. hydrogen bonds) that don't actually require ionizing radiation to break them. Now breaking a hydrogen bond in DNA doesn't change the structure, but it can unzip the DNA, and cause different genes to be expressed. Every cell in your body has the same DNA, but your liver and your skin cells read different parts of the DNA so they make different proteins, which means they look and act differently. Some non-ionizing radiation can affect this (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633881/) and while this is the same general range as the airport body scanners, the scanners probably don't provide enough energy or for long enough to show this effect. However, some of the new 5G cell phones, and some high-speed wireless (that some phone companies are rolling out to simplify connecting new houses, not the normal WiFi), also use similar EM energies and they would involve much longer exposure times so should probably be studied better.  For a long time there was concern about living near high voltage power lines, since they also produce EM radiation (of the non-ionizing type). It turns out that people who live under power lines get cancer more often, but when this was analysed more carefully, the problem is that poor people tend to live under power lines and poor people tend to get cancer more often. We still don't know exactly why poor people tend to get cancer more -- it could be don't know if this is this is due to stress, food, chemicals from clothes, or less access to health care, but we're now sure that it isn't due to the power lines).  Nothing is absolutely, provably, safe in all cases, and it is worth continuing to examine new technologies, but as far as wee can tell there's more danger from not getting enough sleep due to staying up playing on your phone than there is from the radiation from the phone."
65786	0	a	No. They are just trying to keep you away from your phone.  There has been a famous test that was as follows: They asked people who said radiation emmited by radio towers, TVs... had bad effect on their health to move to a location where there is absolutely no radiation. They moved there and said that they were feeling much better. Later they found out that there were no radio towers there because a gigantic radio tower was built there that was used to send signals to space and they didn't want any interference from the sorrounding commercial towers. This towers emmited way more radio signals so it turned out it didn't matter how much radiation there was. People were just lying.

65789	0	a	I have a question about this.  Why do we bother with shielding our other body parts during X-rays, if the damage is so minimal? If a 6 hour flight is 40 times as damaging as an arm X-ray, isn't it all a bit unnecessary?   From a different perspective, shouldn't we be doing more to protect ourselves on flights, if the medical consensus is that X-rays are harmful? I can understand that lead vests for passengers are inefficient in many ways, but what about cabin crew, who fly constantly?  
65790	0	a	Not necessarily *lying* per se, remember, the placebo (and nocebo) effect is surprisingly powerful
65791	0	a	"The big fuss is that when people say ""radiation"" they are conflating anything that emits/radiates energy (i.e. anything but the cold vacuum of space) with ""ionizing radiation""  - x-rays and gamma rays. The normal stuff like light, infrared, UV, radio is so common and harmless, we don't think of it as radiation, except when speaking scientifically.   The reason ionizing radiation is dangerous is that high concentrations of ionizing radiation are so powerful they penetrate all but the most dense matter (ex. lead). Ionizing radiation has so much energy, when it's traveling through matter, it smashes through it, breaking apart molecular bonds. When these molecular bonds are in your DNA, your DNA can get messed up and that cell in you body won't function properly any more. A few cells here and there, your body can handle, the cells self-destruct or are otherwise cleaned up. But if too many get messed up DNA, they get out of control, these cells run amok. We call that cancer.  [Also, here's a handy chart from XKCD explaining the scale and levels of dangerous ionizing radiation.](https://xkcd.com/radiation/)"
65792	0	a	You've got an excellent answer there but if you need more reassurance then you might like to know that the effects of these frequencies of radiation (and mobile phones in general) on the body are being actively studied. I'm taking part in an international study called [Cosmos](http://www.ukcosmos.org/) which is tracking the health of thousands of people to try to determine if there is any long term effects that are not immediately obvious. When the study was started the assumption was that there would be no effects to radiation of this power level and frequency range but it had never been studied in detail for extended periods of time and there was a media frenzy about mobile phones causing health damage (which makes funding easy to get).  I forget how long the study has been going now but it's many years. There was an interim report a couple of years ago and, as expected, no ill effects were found. IIRC the study is scheduled to run for 40 years so I'll be an old man by the time it ends.
65793	0	a	No it would make it worse. It's the equivalent of using a megaphone to try to have a conversation. Everyone else is now deaf and you can't hear over yourself. (This is just an analogy, the real problems are way to technical to explain via cell keyboard)
65794	0	a	Most answers focus on a more hypothetical case; practically, the components of your router such as DC-DC converters and capacitors are likely not rated for that use and will be destroyed. The mostly likely result is turning your router into a brick, which will decrease your WiFi coverage.
65795	0	a	"For technicians, it often adds up to a meaningful number and using PPE to block a third or so of the exposure makes a lot of sense.  Then there are some particularly vulnerable parts of the body—looking at you, ya damn thyroid—where minimizing exposure is always a good idea.  But beyond that...  For patients, there's not much of a reason outside of guarding against rare (practically unheard of?) malfunctions. OK, there's one other: to get the patient to shut up. Seriously, after having conversations with several dentists and their techs about the idiotic conversations they endure around x-rays, flouride, cancer screenings, and any number of other things, it's a pretty easy ""yes please"" to just throw the apron on.  https://www.iaea.org/resources/rpop/health-professionals/dentistry/patients   >**Should patients and carers wear lead aprons and personal protective devices during a dental radiographic procedure?**  >With well-designed and optimized equipment and procedures there is no need for routine use of lead aprons for the patient in dental radiology. Lead aprons may provide some protection in the rare case of the vertex occlusal examination, especially in a patient who is, or may be, pregnant. On the other hand, the use of a lead apron may reassure patients that every effort is being made to ensure their safety, and may reduce the amount of time that needs to be taken to reassure them. Certainly, a lead apron should be provided for any patient who requests one. It may also be advisable to consider using them on a cautionary basis where equipment and/or technique have not been verified by a radiation protection specialist, and where they will not otherwise interfere with the examination. Thyroid collars should be used in all examinations where the thyroid may be exposed to the main beam or to a considerable amount of scatter radiation.  >Lead aprons must be provided for a person who is required to support a patient during the radiographic procedure (i.e., a comforter or carer). Assisting adults should be positioned so that all parts of their body are out of the main beam.  "
65796	0	a	Small clarification here: The threshold for ionizing radiation is typically placed in the middle of the UV spectrum. This is why UV is often broken up into UVA, UVB, and UVC categories, with increasing levels of skin cancer risk. 
65797	0	a	> UVA, UVB, and UVC categories   [Penetration factor](https://www.who.int/uv/faq/whatisuv/en/index2.html)    UVC doesn't penetrate our atmosphere, UVB doesn't penetrate past our skin surface, UVA goes deep into the skin.  >Short-wavelength UVC is the most damaging type of UV radiation. However, it is completely filtered by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth's surface.  >Medium-wavelength UVB is very biologically active but cannot penetrate beyond the superficial skin layers. It is responsible for delayed tanning and burning; in addition to these short-term effects it enhances skin ageing and significantly promotes the development of skin cancer. Most solar UVB is filtered by the atmosphere.  >The relatively long-wavelength UVA accounts for approximately 95 per cent of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. It can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and is responsible for the immediate tanning effect. Furthermore, it also contributes to skin ageing and wrinkling. For a long time it was thought that UVA could not cause any lasting damage. Recent studies strongly suggest that it may also enhance the development of skin cancers.
65798	0	a	Yes, in fact the ISS isn't just at risk of UV, it's also at risk of cosmic rays and lots of other sources of radiation. This is a big concern for long-distance/long-term space travel (especially leaving Earth's magnetic field) so a Mars mission would need heavy shielding.   The windows in the ISS, as well as being incredibly strong (they've got to keep in a pressurised atmosphere and survive micrometeorite strikes), will filter out UV radiation from the sun.
65799	0	a	The Mariana trench is about 11,000 meters below sea level. If you built a cofferdam down to that depth, as u/SirHerald suggests, the pressure would be about 3.2 atm. Divers experience a similar pressure at a depth of around 22 meters, so humans can survive these pressures in the short term. In the long term, I found [this chart](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/conghand/fig15d3.gif) from NASA suggesting you would have to worry about mild [nitrogen narcosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis), making you feel slightly drunk, and mild [oxygen toxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity). So you probably wouldn't want to live at that pressure, but a short trip down wouldn't be any worse than diving.  But, your question was about draining the oceans. The oceans cover 72% of the surface of the earth, and the average depth of the ocean is about 3700 meters. That means a large portion of the atmosphere will sink into the ocean, resetting 1 atm of pressure to a depth of something like 2600 meters below sea level. So that would make the Mariana trench a bit more tolerable at around 2.5 atm, but it would also mean some high altitude cities would become nearly uninhabitable.   **edit** Fixed the bracket on the link. Wish I had caught it before I left this morning - wasn't expecting this to blow up so much.

Permanent loss of vision has not been observed in adults, as u/Moorgan17 stated earlier. Permanent loss of vision has been seen however in young animals. A study was conducted years ago where one of a kitten's eyes was stitched up pretty much right from birth. I believe the eye was kept closed for about a year (at least a couple of months, but I'll double check that). When the eye was opened back up again, the kitten was permanently blind in that eye. I'll try find then start and link it. I'm on mobile right now.  This has to do with the Occam's razor effect that developing brains have. This behaviour transcends species and basically means ""If you're not using it, get rid of it"". It's a way of the brain not putting effort into something that doesn't work anymore. It's even been shown that the part of the brain associated with the loss of sight ends up working on some other part of the body (kind of like how blind people have slightly heightened other senses). This is known as brain plasticity.  Side note: brain plasticity also works in the opposite way. A young girl had half of her brain removed in an attempt to relieve her of her constant seizures. This left the young girl paralyzed on one half of her body and with several cognitive difficulties too. Over time, however, the half of the brain that was left began to compensate for the lack of brain mass and she began to regain movement in the side of her body affected by the surgery, her language and other cognitive skills.   Basically brains are cool.   Edit: a video on Jody, the girl with half a brain https://youtu.be/VaDlLD97CLM  Edit 2: for those interested in the kitten study, see Hubel, D. H. & Wiesel, T. N. (1964). Effects of Monocular Deprivation in Kittens  As it turns out, the kittens' eyes were sutured for only a few weeks, not even months."
65818	0	a	If the eye is covered does it still focus?  If it doesn't could the muscles that control focus atrophy and cause issues?
65819	0	a	I'm genuinely curious, How is sewing a kittens eye lids shut ethical?
65820	0	a	The muscles that control focus are ring-shaped autonomic sphincters and those rarely wear out or you'd leak.  Plus they have no effect after 50 or 55.. they continue to work but the lens doesn't deform in response so the eyes don't focus up close and reading glasses must be used to add the missing focusing power.  The H&W experiments and many others show that the absence of light OR focusable forms will severely restrict vision development, but once the neurology develops say by age 8-10, occlusion does no harm.  
65821	0	a	"Basically the crystalline lens (behind the cornea) is made of cells that continually grow from birth. Those cells can't go anywhere and ultimately stack on top of each other and eventually ""cloud up"" after years and years.   From u/nxplkbl ""The crystalline lens is behind the cornea and flexes and allows you to focus from distance to up close. It becomes cloudy after years of sun exposure, sorta like clear plastic left in the sun over time becomes brown.   Cataract surgery is when an ophthalmologist removes and replaces the crystalline lens. ""   Trauma can also cause cataracts and some people get them early. They can cause blurry vision, haziness, night glare issues, and if left untreated blindness. Most people start getting them in their 50s, and some people's take years to fully develop.

65822	0	a	There are special regulations, but things like this get approved for research all the time. It’s technically ethical because they are not in pain 
65823	0	a	Oh man, I thought it was because the muscles got weaker with age. You're saying the lens loses elasticity? Somehow I find that worse.
65824	0	a	By that logic, it would be ethical if I anesthetized someone, castrated them while they're anesthetized, and then keep them sedated until its healed. 
65825	0	a	Realisticly it's probably better, medical advances could see artificial lenses produced and (I'm assuming) replaced, where a muscle (I imagine) would be harder to fix

I think it's one of the most promising vision correction options I've heard of- I read an article years back about someone who was trying to develop an artificial lens that could give greater than 20/20 vision, and the procedure basically just involves sucking out your old lens, and rolling up the new artificial one into a small syringe and injecting it into the eye.

65831	0	a	It’s not that we forget our earliest years, it’s that we don’t form memories in the first place. The term for this is infantile “amnesia”, but this is not actually a form of amnesia — that would require forgetting. As infants grow into toddlers, their brains grow fantastically quickly. So much so, that any pathways that are deemed unimportant/weak are “pruned”. Pruning is the technical term actually. By age three, pruning calms down to the point where toddlers can start forming the memories they’ll remember for possibly the rest of their lives. However, usually the very earliest memories are traumatic or notable in some way. Pruning continues for some time into childhood. Maybe age 4.   Edit: this has gotten more traction than I anticipated, and I have to clarify: when I say “we don’t form memories in the first place” what I’m saying is that we form memories that we will NOT be able to RECALL after our brains grow and pruning occurs. Toddlers can remember things, but, as we’ve all experienced, they forget an exceptional amount of their day-to-day experiences. As another user pointed out, toddlers actually are learning a metric ton of stuff (motor, language, etc.).   Edit 2: another user pointed out that it is the delayed development of the hippocampus (learning/memory/encoding center) that contributes to infantile amnesia. 
65832	0	a	"What you are taking about is autobiographical memory.  Infants easily form other types of memories, including procedural memory (eg learning to walk), and semantic memory (learning what things are).  Infantile amnesia is limited to autobiographical memories.  There are lots of ideas as to why this is.  One is a lack of self awareness - the child hasn't yet learned that they are an individual and that there are other individuals.  The second is language development.  Autobiographical memory is often descriptive, eg. ""I went to the store "".  Encoding this memory may rely on language skills that have not yet developed.  These are all related to the underlying neurophysiological development."
65833	0	a	"Check out this article, it's essentially saying that the brain isn't really concerned about memories at that age, it just needs to get a grip on how reality works.  https://www.livescience.com/32963-why-dont-we-remember-being-babies.html  This article covers a much wider range of subjects including the gap in memory varies by up to 2 years depending on where you're born, the article says one theory on that is some cultures don't value early childhood memories and that may affect how hard we try to hold onto them. The article has no definitive answer but covers what appear to be reasonable theories such as the brain isn't ""recording"" episodic memories or *can't* record them yet due to a still-growing hippocampus. http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160726-the-mystery-of-why-you-cant-remember-being-a-baby  This article is more focused on the explanation being proposed that the brain is still developing neurons in the region where memories are formed.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-can-t-you-remember-being-a-baby/  I am absolutely not an expert in this field but I've read enough to know that memories are the connections between neurons in specific parts of the brain. There is also an element of flexibility, called [plasticity](https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticityhttps://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticity), in the brain that defines how easily connections are made or broken.   When we are very young the brain is very flexible, we have a lot to learn. Connections are made and broken quickly.   It would seem plausible that driving force for not being able to recall specific memories while the brain is still adding neurons to the memory-related parts of the brain(the bbc article mentions this) and while the brain is still extraordinarily flexible, those connections that make memories may not last very long. New neurons would disrupt those networks of connections and new memories could be making use of connections involved in other memories until there isn't enough left of a given episode's network to recall the memory.   I wouldn't be surprised if culture played into that as well, if you try to hold onto a memory your attempt to access it can strengthen the connections to the episode over time and make it harder to forget(no idea if that affects accuracy of the memory). If no one in your culture gives a shit about a specific type of memory why bother trying to recall it?   I know just enough about this stuff to get myself into trouble so check the sources and don't quote me on jack shit."

65836	0	a	I research how scientists communicate with the public and you would be surprised how many scientists use field-specific words, which often excludes the public. Research suggests that scientists who can communicate their field of study in simple terms are perceived as more knowledgeable by their audiences versus scientists who use too many fancy words so people can't understand.
65837	0	a	As someone who has an interest in child development (I am at the early stages of a psychology degree) what reading do you recommend?
65838	0	a	No, but I had a really good teacher named Dr. Gabriel Radvansky. He has a textbook called Human Memory that is really well written. I highly recommend it. 
65839	0	a	I can't think of any readings in particular right now, but I would recommend using your university's peer-reviewed article access and just look up child development, and let the research pull you through articles that you find interesting. Also make sure you try to look at it from different perspectives- scientific, psychological, counseling, school, etc.  My undergrad was in psych with a counseling minor, and I was intending on adolescent counseling before switching career paths so it's a topic I love too. I'll try to remember to come back with some readings for you.
65840	0	a	I’m a Neuropsychologist my self. I became fascinated with memory when I learned about Clive Wearing. It blew my mind.

65841	0	a	"Dogs are relatively intelligent, with complex personalities, so the answer isn't completely ""yes"" or ""no.  The simple answer is no, in the general case dogs can recognize other dogs, but don't show preference for certain breeds.  This has been tested with simple visual identification:  Dogs recognize the dog species among several other species on a computer screen  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130214103703.htm  The complicated answer is closer to ""yes"", because the size and behavior of the other dogs will be relevant to their social dynamic.  Also, dogs may respond to certain smells or visual cues that correspond to various breeds depending on that dog's personal experience; Paedomorphosis affects agonistic visual signals of domestic dogs.  (In fact there is a study called ""Paedomorphosis affects agonistic visual signals of domestic dogs.   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000334729690370X)   In addition to that, the instinctive methods of communication may be slightly different between breeds   So while dogs don't necessarily prefer one breed over others, the morphology and psychology inherent to different breeds will affect how they treat different dogs.  In addition, they can make positive or negative associations that correlate to those breeds."
65842	0	a	Is there any information on *how* dogs seem to recognize all breeds, despite the large differences? What 'tells' a tiny corgi that a great Dane in the distance is, in fact, a dog and vice versa?

65844	0	a	">The complicated answer is closer to ""yes"", because the size and behavior of the other dogs will be relevant to their social dynamic.    Followup question on the above - if size and behaviour is relevant to their social dynamic, what happens if two dogs of vastly different sizes grow up together? I'm guessing behavior would form based on their interactions, but if you have a tiny dog and a massive dog, will the tiny dog tend to view other massive dogs as ""friends"" and vice versa? And would the tiny dog be more likely to view other tiny dogs as not part of their social circle due to common interactions with massive dogs, and vice versa? "
65845	0	a	You could ask the same question about how humans recognize various dog breeds despite them looking so different. I don't remember ever seeing an unfamiliar dog breed and not knowing it was a dog.
65846	0	a	Your brain will compensate away the green tint, similar to automatic color balance in a camera, and the gray will then look red in comparison. Knowing anything about strawberries is not necessary.  The brain guesses that the background is meant to be white, which helps this compensation happen.
65847	0	a	"Even though the ""red"" in the altered image is literally just gray, it is still *more* red than green is on the hue scale. If we break the colors into the RGB components, the green will be something like R:0 G:200 B:50, and the grey will be R:100 G:100 G:100, that is, much more red component and much less green component.  The eye/brain's color processing is super complex, but the most simple version is that we take a lot of cues from the *differences* between shades, and not their absolute values."
65848	0	a	I actually messed around with that picture today. Here's an imgur link to my experiments: http://imgur.com/a/y9TGC  I made it an indexed image with 3 colors: black, white, and blue.  Zoomed out, the berries look red (so it wasn't the varied shades of gray causing it).  The more you zoom in, the effect goes away.  I was staring at it up close, then would zoom out slowly and there was like a magic % zoom where the colors would just kind of pop in - really weird.   I have a cousin-in-law that has a degree in art/painting/color theory and said it had to do with the color white, since it's made of all colors.  I tried replacing the white with a ton of different colors, and the illusion immediately goes away.  I then did some color corrections (curves) and re-indexed it with 5 colors: red, green, blue, black, white - and was able to recreate what the original image probably was.  
65849	0	a	Yes. A person who has never seen a strawberry before, will still see them red.  You can crop a small part of the image (where you see red) with 'paint' for example, and look at it alone, so that it is no longer obvious that you are looking at a strawberry, and you still see that small area red.  However, if you copy that reddish color (use the color picker tool) and paint some lines in other place, over white background, you won't see it red any longer. Now it will be clearly grey. It becomes reddish when you use that color next to the other greenish color.  [example](http://i.imgur.com/matFq6b.png)

[Image](http://www.illusionspoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Color-Adapting-optical-illusion-4.jpg)  If you cover up everything but the center pieces, you can see that they're identical.
65851	0	a	See if this helps clear things up: http://imgur.com/a/asxki  TIDL (Too impatient, didn't look): It has nothing to do with the strawberries, it only has to do with the two colors being next to each other.  Your brain perceives color as what is there modified by what is nearby.  Local changes in color affect your brain's perception.
65852	0	a	This is the answer. It's called [color constancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy). You could replace the strawberries in the picture with plastic balls and they would still look red because we are adjusting for the lighting, not (only) using knowledge or strawberries.
65853	0	a	This is the same reason why there was a blue/black vs. white/gold debate about that famous dress that went viral a few years back.  The dress was blue and black, but the (yellow?) lighting in the picture turned the pixels white and gold. The picture was taken in such a way as to put it right on the cusp, so some peoples' brains were filtering out the lighting and seeing it as blue and black. Whereas others were seeing just the pixels and their brain didn't do the math for them, so they saw white/gold.
65854	0	a	This was my first thought as well but can anybody confirm?
65855	0	a	http://imgur.com/a/DtqDs here is the same image with everything but the center piece painted white. They are in fact the same color.
65856	0	a	Thank you for that link. But sheesh, the cylinder and checker board picture will never *not* mess with me.
65857	0	a	Additionally the room was lit in such a way and combined with the flash it could be viewed two ways. The most common adjustment we're used to is seeing a light object under a shadow, and that is white/gold lookers perceived the dress. It looked like it was being shadowed in a brightly lit room. The blue/black lookers interpreted the camera flash as to having flushed out all the color and applying a yellow filter to everything. By changing perspective between the literal pixels and an adjusted perception of the flash, one could see it both ways.
65858	0	a	Yes, I saw this on a photographer's twitter and in the discussion someone posted the RGB histogram showing that the photo actually has red pixels in it, and quite a few. That's due to the way our current display technology displays colors/grays

65864	0	a	"The stripes aren't exactly the same color unless you only take the color from the center of the line. The orange and purple ""bleed"" into the green stripes, which makes the orange-tainted stripes look more green and the purple-tainted stripes more blue.

Edit: see OP's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5x3wr2/comment/defhkxt?st=IZSWGOIK&sh=af96723e) for versions with less compression artifacts"

65866	0	a	It's really fun to bring it into paint, use the eyedropper tool to select the color, and draw around on the squares. Looks like you have a magic gradient tool: http://i.imgur.com/8orHDcb.png

65870	0	a	Radioactivity, by itself, is not that useful for generating power. What is useful for generating power is the induced splitting of _lots_ of atoms at the same time, not the slow trickle of energy release you get from radioactive decay alone. To put it another way: nuclear reactors don't work because their fuel is radioactive, they work because their fuel is splittable by neutrons. Those are not the same thing (all fuel splittable by neutrons is radioactive, but not all radioactive atoms are splittable by neutrons). 
65871	0	a	Strictly speaking, we CAN use most nuclear waste. Breeder reactors can be used to consume pretty much all usable fissle materials and produce a much lower volume of equivalent waste with different properties.  Breeder reactors can be used to manufacture weapons grade fissile material though, so there's political aspects, as well as economic ones-- uranium is fairly abundant.  Edit: spelling errors.
65872	0	a	It is very usable, just not in our current nuclear reactors. Uranium fuel rods are pellets of uranium held together by a metal casing. Being inside a reactor causes the metal to become brittle, and the life of the fuel rod is determined by the life of that casing.   In other reactor designs, like molten salt reactors, this casing is not used. The fuel stays in the reactor for much longer and much more of the potential energy is extracted. This results in lower volumes of waste that is much less radioactive for much less time than that coming from traditional reactors.   Learn more about molten salt reactors [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor). They’re pretty awesome!
65873	0	a	American scientists developed a nuclear reprocessing system called PUREX (Plutonium-Uranium Extraction) to resume spent nuclear fuel rods. But Ford suspended it and Carter ended it permanently because of the plutonium by-product and the Non-Proliferation Agreements. Now France reprocesses many nation's fuel for reuse using this 50 year old technology.

65875	0	a	> Breeder reactors can be used to manufacture weapons grade fissile material though, so there's political aspects, as well as economic ones-- uranium is fairly abundant.  Where does the perception come from then that i've heard in debates in college that there is only 50 years of uranium supply left in the world from current mines ?  One source says 200 years but 30k with breeder reactors-  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/
65876	0	a	Do they use recycled nuclear waste or does it require more potent material?
65877	0	a	From current mines, that's the key point. As with any non-renewable, as long as there is demand, we will keep looking for new sources even if they are more expensive. Extraction from seawater could provide hundreds of years of fuel, but it's no where as cheap as digging up rocks.
65878	0	a	You are confusing molten sodium metal and molten salt.   Molten salts are extremely stable.  This is because the constituent atoms are very electronegative (fluorine) and electropositive (lithium,beryllium). It takes a lot of energy to break their bonds and once you do they can simply recombine.  This is why they are so useful in reactors.  The neutron damage that occurs in other materials doesn't happen in molten salts.  This is why the fuel can be left in the reactor until it is largely consumed.  Comparatively, the fuel rods in a light water reactor must be removed after only a few percent of the fuel is consumed.
65879	0	a	If I remember correctly many satellites use plutonium, a by-product from making uranium for nuclear bombs. 
65880	0	a	Thousands actually if memory is correct. If i remember correctly, there's enough fuel in the ocean (uranium flouride aka UF6 ) to power modern reactors for 15000 years. Also we will find more ways to be efficient 
65881	0	a	Not necessarily a by-product. Rather, non-fissile Uranium-238 is 'enriched' in a reactor so it turns into plutonium via beta decay. It's usually the intended product, not leftovers. Small amounts can be produced in normal reactors, with the small amounts of 238 left after purifying the raw uranium. But it is probably easier to take it from a nuclear arsenal than slowly gathering it from the nuclear waste with chemistry. I may be wrong though, corrections are welcome. 
65882	0	a	There's a paper out there that argues that by combining seawater extraction with breeder reactors, we could supply several times our current energy consumption until the Sun swallows the Earth.
65883	0	a	So, why not use this capability to desalinate water, while harvesting sweet sweet radioactive material?
65884	0	a	Exactly, Pu238 is used, which is primarily an alpha emitter. Alphas have very short range in matter because they are massive and highly charged, so they primarily heat the plutonium itself. The decay heat is harvested and used to make electricity.  238 is present in spent nuclear fuel but is difficult to produce in a normal reactor. It's normally made by neutron activation of Np237 or less commonly of Americium. Most of it was produced as part of nuclear weapons prduction at Savannah River, but they stopped and there was fear of a shortage for space applications. NASA currently has a joint project with the Department of Energy to develop ways to produce more.  Edit: thanks for gold! To add, DoE/NASA is interested in ways to produce 238 that are both economical and proliferation resistant. It doesn't make sense to produce it like they used to because it's too expensive and only made sense as a byproduct of weapons production. The original process is also a proliferation concern, because the other product is Pu239 in a form that is the kind you need to make weapons.
65885	0	a	It can also be recovered by the nuclear fission of Thorium-232. This is most easily done in a liquid-fluoride thorium reactor, a type of molten salt reactor.
65886	0	a	I mean... M.A.D. has resulted in the most peaceful period of time in all of human history. It's sad that we were only able to create this peace by making war so world-endingly horrifying that no one wants to attempt it anymore, but I'll take the win all the same. 
65887	0	a	This is just not true.  It sounds good, fits a narrative and people repeat it, but the facts don’t bear it out.  1) you can’t have a thorium cycle without obtaining enriched uranium or plutonium first.  Thorium isn’t fissile, it needs to be bred by neutron capture into u-233.  Assuming you have a driver fuel to start the reaction off (u-233, u-235 or pu-239) then you can breed more u-233, but only slowly - Eg if you get 2.3-ish neutrons per fission, 1 is needed to induce another fission to continue the reaction, 1 is needed to breed th-232 to u-233 to maintain the original quantity of fuel, then you have 0.3 to cover losses and breeding new fuel.  Most goes to losses (it’s actually very hard to get into breed most rather than a net burn) so you end up growing your original fuel only very slowly if at all.  Best way to create the original supply of driver fuel is then to dig up and enrich the only naturally occurring fissile isotope u-235.  For practical purposes you have to start with uranium first.  This can be either by enrichment t get it to a good enough quality to drive a thorium reactor or by using it in a uranium cycle and obtaining plutonium as a by product which can then be used as your driver fuel.  Either way you inevitably end up with the uranium enrichment or plutonium breeding technology to produce bombs.  There literally isn’t a way of getting to a thorium cycle up and running without creating technology that could be used to create bomb grass material.  2) there have been many attempts at thorium research reactors and it turns out its hard.  It’s not like the technology has just been idly ignored.  Billions have been thrown at the problem from a variety of nations.  The most promising tech is usually considered liquid thorium salt (unfortunately highly corrosive), as it would allow a continual process of feeding in to a reactor fresh thorium and extracting the fission products (which poisons the reaction by absorbing neutrons - bad for breeding).  But even today the materials tech that can cope with a thorium liquid salt at commercial scale isn’t there (ie providing commercial scale outputs for decades).  Comparatively uranium fuel cycles are readily achievable even with 1950’s tech.  There are lots of research programmes but again demonstrably with 60 years of scientific and engineering advancements, not a single country has managed a viable thorium commercial reactor.
65888	0	a	If I understand the political angle correctly, there are several issues, there is a great deal of cost in getting the eventual ok to build a new nuclear reactor.  While I would say a good deal of any energy sector regulation is there because of safety, there is little political will with how nuclear is seen (in the US and maybe Japan) to streamline the permit process to build new reactors.  Because it is prohibitively expensive to get through the permit process, that is if they make it through, most interested in making money off energy can go other safer routes (safer as in sure ROI).  And because so few get approved and built (make it more expensive) the pay back time on a nuclear reactor is pretty long.  Add to the fact the there is a shortage of nuclear workers (Navy has a hard time keeping theirs) that probably adds to it as well.  There are also subsidies for other forms of energy and I am not sure if nuclear has the same.  In the end it comes down to economics, public perception/willpower, and politics.  Personally I would like the talk of the infrastructure plan to include many nuclear power plants as the ones in the US we have are old and continually upgraded, but new ones would probably be better.

65890	0	a	So, immunotherapy has long been seen as a holy grail for cancer treatment. The immune system is naturally programmed to attack cells that have gone a bit weird (to use the scientific term). The problem tends to be that the cancer cells can also alter themselves so that they are disguised from the immune system, or in fact inhibit any immune cells that come into contact with them. This stops the immune system from seeing them as dangerous, allowing the cancer to grow. So the balance of the immune response is in favour of leaving the cancer alone.  What this treatment does is inject the tumour with molecules that tell the immune cells in the vicinity of the tumour to wake up and start doing their job, overcoming the inhibition that the cancer cells have put in place. This means that the balance of the immune response is now to attack the tumour, which seems to work very well.  The really cool thing is that now that the immune system is trained to see the tumour as bad, and will attack similar cells in different sites. This is why it behaves in some fashion like a vaccine.  It's perfectly viable, and very exciting. As always, there is always the question of how well it translates into human biology but it is still very promising. I think one problem is going to be how specific the immune response is. In the paper, they see the immune cells are trained to attack cells with protein markers unique to the tumour cells, which is a good sign. One concern might be that if you accidentally trigger the immune response to normal cell markers, it could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells which would obviously be a very bad consequence. Another would be how readily a tumour can evolve to overcome the immune system attack. If the immune system only ends up going for certain markers, it could miss tumour cells that don't have the same ones. These could then continue to grow and cause the cancer to return.  ETA: thank you kind, golden stranger!  ...strangers!
65891	0	a	I work in this field.   This type of cancer vaccine is kinda old news. What's really cutting edge are the personalized cancer vaccines based on mRNA that are in clinical trails in humans **already**. Basically, these vaccines are tailored to an individual's cancer. You see, your cancer and my cancer may have the same name, lymphoma for example, but they may be very different in terms of their susceptibility to drugs and especially to vaccines. Using personal genomics to tailor mRNA to program your own cells to make a vaccine against your very unique form of cancer is the real key to all of this. Adding on top of this is that mRNA is just a superior way to produce vaccines. As it turns out, when your body makes the vaccine inside its own cells, it stimulates your immune system more effectively than a vaccine made in a factory and injected (this has to do with MHC1 and MHC2 activation).   These clinical trials are looking promising. If they work, this can be combined with checkpoint inhibitors and other mRNA therapies (that also boost immune response against cancer) and it's bye-bye cancer.   Let's just say that it's the most promising thing I've seen in cancer therapy ever. 
65892	0	a	There is a treatment for stage 4 brain cancer that does this indirectly. Duke has modified the polio virus to attack cancer cells, and they inject it into the center of a brain tumor. While the polio virus is attacking the cells, the immune system starts going in to clean up the mess.  In turn, the immune system learns to recognize the cancer cells.  The whole process seems to last for months after just the one single injection.  You can google PVS-RIPO for further information.  The first few patients were treated in 2012-2013 and some are still alive without any further treatment. Those patients had recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme, which is perhaps the deadliest cancer situation that one can imagine.  While this would technically be considered virotherapy, the immune system plays a huge role in the outcome.  They are now in phase 2 trials, and still only for brain tumors, but I believe the assumption is that it could be widely used among many different solid tumors in the future.
65893	0	a	It's actually a really cool concept that frankesteins together mechanisms of action that we already use.  1. Making cancer cells visible to the immune system: PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors  2. Siccing T-cells on cancer: CAR-T cells, Allogenous stem cell transplantation, BiTE immunotherapy  They then do this only locally, circumventing the problems that would arise if we did it systemically, i.e. death from immune system overdrive.  I'm interested in seeing how well it works in humans and reading about it made me slightly nervous about my job to be honest

65905	0	a	"Other responses have gone into what makes an individual long-lived. This post will address the question as OP phrased it: what determines the lifespan *of a species*? And what's the deal with human longevity?  Many people have a concept of aging that could be described as the ""wear-and-tear"" model. Basically, the notion is that as you go through life, you accumulate nicks and dings from macroscopic scars and stretch marks to accumulating microscopic injury and DNA damage. Eventually it's just too much and you run down. *It turns out this concept is markedly untrue, at least at the species level*.  Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, has been the workhorse of many experiments, including those studying longevity, life-history theory, and evolution. Many years ago, researchers working with flies did an evolution experiment. They selectively bred fruit flies for longevity, and in a remarkably short time they had flies with dramatically longer life-spans than is the norm. These flies weren't evolving novel genes in just a few generations, rather, they had recombined existing alleles in ways that lead to longevity. The important thing to note is what happened when these long-lived flies were re-introduced into a 'normal' population. Did these super-long-lived flies thrive? No, quite the contrary. Within a few short generations, any sign of longevity had disappeared. In competition with their 'normal' counterparts, they were immediately outcompeted. (I tried finding the original papers, here's a [modern replication](http://www.pnas.org/content/97/7/3309.full) of these sorts of studies, with more precision.)  What these researchers discovered was that while longevity is perfectly possible, and within the realm of already-existing genes in most populations, this potential isn't realized *because of trade-offs*. Increased longevity is exchanged for decreased fitness in other areas. Perhaps these long-lived flies in nature would be less likely to evade predators, have more difficulty finding food, or are less likely to find a mate. Everything has a cost. Note that this is different than the 'programmed' idea of death, that your genes have predetermined a time of death for you. In the life-history model of aging, it's not that DNA 'wants' an organism to die, far from it - it's just that other traits (that hurt longevity) are more directly advantageous to the propagation of genes, and so combinations of genes with these traits out-survive and out-reproduce the combinations that lead to longevity.  The immune system gets interesting. Unless something else kills it first, it's all but inevitable that an animal will die of cancer. The ticking clock of mutations accumulate, eventually leading cells to proliferate out of control, breaking internal apoptosis mechanisms, evading the immune system, and eventually killing the host organism by hogging the lion's share of nutrients and energy.  What exactly is a 'cancer resistance gene' or a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? Why would anything evolve a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? That doesn't make sense, and they don't. Rather, it's a gene that is perilously close to breaking something important, if it mutates. *Redundancy* is an important concept. If you have 3 copies of something important, you're more or less ok if 2 of them break. If you only have 1 copy, you will be in trouble quickly. Animals that tend to be long-lived, such as elephants and whales, tend to have many, multiply redundant copies of genes involved in important functions like apoptosis and immune regulation - the sorts of genes that when they break ~~tend to cause~~ are no longer able to stop cancer.  Humans don't seem to have nearly enough multiply-redundant copies of these sorts of genes to explain all of our longevity, while it might contribute somewhat. We don't look like elephants or whales in this respect. This sort of evolution towards longevity would reasonably be expected to take a relatively long time to evolve, as many duplication events would have to happen, and then spread through the population.   It seems humans are probably like the flies that were selectively bred specifically for longevity. In humans, the [grandmother hypothesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/428128a)  conceives of human longevity as something that is directly advantageous to gene propagation ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis) introduces the concept well). It's a sort of grandiose kin selection, where elderly humans in prehistoric times were still able to contribute to the survival and reproductive fitness of their children, grandchildren, and extended relatives. Unlike other species that experience a rapid deterioration after their own ability to reproduce goes into decline (such as salmon after spawning), humans *could* contribute into their later years, and so longevity was selected for. Maybe we're not so unlike our experimental flies after all."
65906	0	a	Evolutionary biologist here, a lot of the posts here are accurately describing the mechanisms by which we are better protected from aging, but behind each of those is a genetic prerogative for longer life.  The first principle is that the fitness of an organism is defined as its ability to produce offspring which in turn survive to reproduce.  If humans live longer that a comparable species, it must be because of an increase in fitness. Some of the leading theories are longer term parental care or multi generational families.  Think about it this way: why should women ever go through menopause?  It's because having non reproductive women in the social group increases the fitness of her offspring. 
65907	0	a	There's no hard-and-fast rule that I'm aware of, but several things factor into it (in no particular order).  1. Metabolism. As a general rule, the slower the organism's metabolism, the longer it will usually live.  2. Growth rate. The slower the growth, the longer the lifespan.  3. Age at maturity. Animals that reach maturity at a later age tend to have a longer lifespan.
65908	0	a	From an evolutionary perspective, if an animal is likely to be eaten early on in its life, it doesn't make sense for that species to invest energy on lengthening its life. More likely, it would invest its energy in producing as many offspring as quickly as possible.  An animal that is not easily predated is more likely to invest energy in processes that lengthen lifespan, and focus on raising just a few offspring (quality vs. quantity).
65909	0	a	Cool! This explained things very well for me. Thank you!
65910	0	a	The fruit fly study is really interesting, though now I would be curious to know what are the down sides of long life? Surely longer life in flies would just lead to more offspring. In what way are they being disadvantaged? Are they slower? Less fertile? Something else?
65911	0	a	So then why do tortoises live so long?
65912	0	a	Exactly.  Humans have more learned behaviors than most other species.  Having a longer youth and longer parental lifespans allows this to be better passed on to the next generation.  So there is an evolutionary advantage to living longer for us.
65913	0	a	The cancer resistance gene is question is TP53, which has a suppressive effect on tumors. Unfortunately it seems to cause premature aging as a side-effect on mice trials.  We can only hope that multiple genes for cancer, aging, metabolism and many many others can be identified and engineered soon.
65914	0	a	What about parrots? It seems like they contradict all of those
65915	0	a	There is a general negative correlation between longevity and fecundity - i.e. how rapidly a group reproduces. There have been experiments in which animals were put into an environment with none of their natural predators, and as their average lifespan extended they found the individuals were reproducing later and later. Not really an answer to your question but just an illustration how the two things could be linked in principle. 
65916	0	a	More to the point, why are certain lobsters and jellyfish immortal as far as we can tell? 
65917	0	a	I am certain humanity will achieve immunity from ageing and illness. The day after I die. 
65918	0	a	Can those genes be retroactively implemented? to cure me when I get cancer? or only for my future kids?
65919	0	a	I recall having seen a study that showed a pretty strong correlation between the age of puberty/sexual maturity and longevity, even among indivuduals of the same species. E.g. late sexual maturity means a longer potential life span.  On a very shallow level I can definitely see how achieving reproductive capabilities later than other individuals might be a disadvantage as you may die of external causes before you can reproduce. Longer generations would make a species adapt slower to environmental changes, which may also be a weakness.
65920	0	a	Jellyfish is an easy one: lack of a ~~neural~~ central nervous system means a lack of most problems that cause us death. Human death is mainly due to a lack of oxygen flow to the brain. No brain solves that pretty quickly.  EDIT for correct wording.
65921	0	a	Trees live a pretty long time as well. We always forget plants in these sorts of discussions, but they are our cousins.
65922	0	a	One of the reasons you get cancer is because genes such as Tp53 are mutated and non-functional. We battle cancer by targeting the downstream effects of these mutations!
65923	0	a	">Longer generations would make a species adapt slower to environmental changes, which may also be a weakness.  This can be seen easily when comparing humans and bacteria. The ability reproduce quickly is the reason bacteria become resistant to so many things so quickly.   It's also the reason we don't rapidly adapt to bacteria.  It's partially because we already did. The development of the immune system was the adaption to bacteria.   It becomes interesting when you look at how fast bacteria reproduce in proportion to humans.   E.Coli for example reproduce every ~20 minutes or so. If we give ""modern humans"" 100k years of existence then it only takes E.Coli a short time to go through the same amount of ""evolution"" to an environment as humans did in 100k years.   Even if the numbers are off by quite a bit, a sludge puddle of E.Coli will ""evolve"" as much as humans have in 100,000 years in a few months. 1 HOUR for E.Coli is roughly 60 human years of ""evolution"" (assuming 20 year generations in humans). So by the time this post is a day old the E.Coli on your food will have had 1440 human equivalent years.   It gives an interesting perspective on the microbiological world that inhabits and surrounds us.   "
65924	0	a	Had no clue they are brainless. How do they function at all without one?
65925	0	a	The thing is, while jellyfish don't have a brain or central nervous system, they do have a very basic set of nerves at the base of their tentacles. These nerves detect touch, temperature, salinity etc. and the jellyfish reflexively respond to these stimuli. A brain is simply a cluster of nerves, this concept of nerve clusters is very very basic in jellyfish
65926	0	a	"Many animals are ""brainless"" at least if you define ""brained"" as having a fully realized and complex neural center similar to the human brain.  A lot of smaller or simpler creatures are much like simple machines: they operate under simple parameters and react to stimuli in simple ways. A jellyfish doesn't need to do terribly much; they simply float from place to place, feeding on microscopic organisms that drift by. Thus, they don't have a whole lot of need for a complex brain.  Worms are another good example--they don't have a centralized and complex brain, but they do have a nervous system that allows them to do simple things. A worm really only needs to do a few things consciously to survive: Burrow, avoid heat, and wiggle around if something tries to grab it. All tasks that can be completed without a brain.  In fact, even in the human body, a lot gets done without having to get the ""main"" part of the brain involved. A lot of automatic actions in our body are handled by our brain stem (heartbeat, unconscious breathing, contractions in your digestive tract), and even some dramatic body movements (like when you automatically pull your arm away from a hot stove) don't even need to involve the brain--just your spinal cord and brain stem.  Humans and many complex creatures get a lot of benefit out of having complex brains--we use them for memories, processing of sights, sounds, complex thoughts, emotions, and more. But when you're a jellyfish whose lifestyle centers around floating from place to place, and you don't have eyes, ears, a nose, or any need for memories or complex emotions, it's fairly easy to get away without having a brain."

The biggest reason is that the abyssal zone of the ocean is truly enormous and has existed for billions of years. Evolution has been able to have its heyday down there, which has led to a diverse assemblage of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, and other invertebrates.  On top of this, there are only two freshwater lakes on earth that are over 1000 m deep, Baikal and Tanganyika. The latter is about ten million years old, the former perhaps 30 million years old. Compared to the age of the ocean, that is a tiny fraction of time. They have also been isolated from other water bodies due to topography, so there aren't many immigrants that can later evolve into new species.  In addition, Tanganyika has spent a significant proportion of its history as a much shallower lake than this (it was actually multiple lakes, which is [reflected in the diversity of cichlid fish there](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/7087/Mitochondrial_Phylogeography_of_Rock_Dwelling_1996.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)). So the abyssal zone in Tanganyika is relatively young and unstable.  Baikal is older and larger and the abyssal zone was more stable (including never scoured by ice like most similar lakes), but it is still in a cold climate (less biodiversity to begin with) and isolated from other bodies of water. Because of the depth of ice coverage, the entire Baikal ecosystem has occasionally [collapsed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204001099), effectively re-starting the evolutionary race.  So the two lakes on earth that are deep enough to be completely devoid of light just haven't had the evolutionary chances of the ocean.

65943	0	a	A cannonball is ejected from a cannon courtesy of a pressure difference caused by exploding gunpowder. If the ambient pressure around the cannon is greatly increased such that the pressure behind the ball upon firing is still less than the ambient pressure, the cannonball will not move, barring structural failure of the cannon itself. I guess if the cannon were submerged and allowed to equilibrate, then this wouldn't be a problem, but idk. You're right though, that's a weird analogy to use and I don't think it's appropriate here.
65944	0	a	Well, pressure is calculated as P = r * g * h where:  * P is pressure  * r is the density of the fluid  * g is acceleration due to gravity  * h is the height of fluid above the object  So water has a density of 1000 kg per cubic meter (thanks metric system),   * r = 1000 kg / m^3  * g = 9.8 m / s^2  * h = 1642 m  thus   P =  (1000 kg / m^3 ) * (9.8 m / s^2 ) * 1642 m =16091600 kg*m/s^2 = 16091600 Newtons/m^2   P = **16091.6 Kilopascals**  Now assuming the cannon is a British 68 pounder, we can assume a nominal load of 16# of black powder -- roughly 7.25 kg.   Now assuming the pressure equalizes on both sides of the cannon ball as the cannon descends, and accounting for all factors: that differential will be 0 Kpa -- because wet gunpowder doesn't burn. Therefore the cannon will not fire.

65953	0	a	>Gunpowder will, in a confined space, build up a pressure of about 42 tons per square inch.   http://www.faversham.org/history/explosives/About_Gunpowder.aspx  That's 580 MPa.  The pressure at the bottom of the lake is 1642 m \* 9.81 m/s^(2) \* 1000 kg/m^(3) = 16 MPa.  That sucker's firing and it's firing hard.  I'm guessing the typical pressure of a cannon blast is lower because of expansion.  If there's pressure holding it in, then, it can become a lot more explosive.  (Not quite sure where to put this in this thread so I'm leaving it here.)

65955	0	a	Deep-sea fish looking scary to us may just be a coincidence (they happen to have the same features that scare us in terrestrial predators, such as fangs and scales). Here is a deep-sea [Barreleye fish](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/25/article-0-03A96D95000005DC-712_634x436.jpg) that looks silly rather than scary.
65956	0	a	"The reason it can ""withstand"" these enormous pressures is that it does not withstand them at all.   A submarine at 1600m would need to be made of thick steel, but only because it contains a void of air at a pressure of approximately 1 atmosphere. Free divers endure compression of their lungs and sinuses on descent (and expansion to original volume while ascending) while scuba divers who can't control their ascent rate can be killed by expanding the gas pockets in their bodies to many times their original volume.  However, this fish - or an ordinary ziplock bag full of nothing but water - has no problems changing depth because it contains no pockets of air that need to be reinforced and protected against crushing."
65957	0	a	That's the highest theoretical pressure you would ever see in a cannon.  A black powder cannon might be around 25,000 psi or so, vs water pressure around 2,400 psi at a depth of 1642 meters.  The thing is by the time the projectile has reached the end of the barrel the pressure will be considerably lower.  I doubt anyone has tested this out but I could see the projectile never leaving the barrel of the gun.  You also have to consider that because the barrel will be filled with water it will absorb a considerable amount of energy from the projectile.  You're not just firing a cannonball out of the gun, you're firing a cannonball plus 10 gallons of water or whatever it is.

65963	0	a	> Barreleye fish  The two big green orbs behind where its eye sockets should be are actually its eyes.

65964	0	a	"Many deep water creatures have evolved to depths by eliminating the swim bladder.  From Wikipedia,  >[""Many organisms develop swim bladders (gas cavities) to stay afloat, but because of the high pressure of their environment, deep-sea fishes usually do not have this organ. Instead they exhibit structures similar to hydrofoils in order to provide hydrodynamic lift.""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_fish?wprov=sfla1)  "
65965	0	a	Holes to what?   It has a digestive tract, and gill membranes, and eye sockets, and reproductive organs, but there is no pressure differential across these 'holes'.  I would guess that this fish, given its crazy ascent/descent behavior, may not have a swim bladder like sharks, and instead regulates its fat levels to be neutrally bouyant at any depth, but if it did have one it would need to vent and oxygenate that swim bladder to maintain equilibrium pressure.
65966	0	a	Proteins need to be flexible to do their jobs. Most proteins are fairly compressible so under sufficient pressure they will lose their flexibility and lose the ability to perform their tasks.  The proteins of deep sea organisms appear to be adapted to maintain their flexibility even with extreme pressures. 
65967	0	a	Finally something I can help out with! Source: I'm a lecturer in the UK (roughly equiv. to assistant professor in the USA) specialising in life cycle assessment, particularly energy sources.  I wrote a paper that's open access, which you can find here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745  The TLDR is that solar is good in terms of climate change but generally less good in terms of other impacts. Overall it's typically not as good as wind or nuclear power. However, bear in mind two things:  1. Impacts are very dependent on location. E.g. solar installed here in the UK is worse than in Nevada or Spain because the impacts are all up-front but you get much more energy output in sunny countries, therefore better impacts per kWh. 2. Solar technology is moving fast. I actually have some updated figures that I'd love to share with you but they're not published yet, so they're not peer-reviewed. Reductions in impacts in the past few years have been considerable: about 50% reduction between 2005 and 2015. So for instance I now estimate a carbon footprint of about 45 g CO2-eq./kWh for a UK installation or 27 g in Spain. This contrasts with the figure of 89g you'll see in the paper I linked.

65969	0	a	Sorry to piggyback on the top answer, but if anyone's interested in impacts other than carbon footprint, here's an answer I wrote further down:  I wrote a paper that's open access, which you can find here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745  The TLDR is that solar is good in terms of climate change but generally less good in terms of other impacts.

65970	0	a	This should be the top voted answer. While this data only looks at CO2, it demonstrates actual numbers and isn't just guesswork on the ecological footprint based on arbitrary dollar value.  Other data I've seen compares strongly with this data on other ecological matters, though I don't have any of those sources with me anymore.  It's also important to note that despite the popular idea about nuclear power being environmentally harmful and deadly, it's actually currently one of the safest and greenest solutions, compared to all other sources including solar power, as demonstrated by these and many other data.  Therefore, solar is a good environmentally friendly solution but nuclear power is greener, from start to finish, per kilowatt hour.
65971	0	a	I read that the byproducts of making solar cells is highly toxic and isn't easily disposed of, is this true?   Edit: Thank you everyone for your replies and input on my question. To be clear, I wasn't asking the question to defend or endorse any type of energy production. I know they all have pros and cons and I've learned a lot about solar and nuclear energy from this post. Thanks again!
65972	0	a	> It's also important to note that despite the popular idea about nuclear power being environmentally harmful and deadly, it's actually currently one of the safest and greenest solutions, compared to all other sources including solar power, as demonstrated by these and many other data.  Yup, among people who look at data and aren't ruled by the 24-hour news cycle, Nuclear looks to be an excellent transition technology with several variants and approaches that (properly)  make most of our reactors look like antiques.   PWRs also are just fine in the ocean (this coming from somebody who is an absurd nerd for sea life)...and WAY better than acidification ...the damage to pteropods in particular is pretty disconcerting. 
65973	0	a	Well like many industrial processes there are some fairly nasty chemicals involved, so to an extent we're relying on good regulation. There have been a few cases in China where various toxic spills have occurred from solar plants (e.g. see [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030802595.html?referrer=emailarticle)).   There are also some issues with specific types of solar power, e.g. CdTe cells or CIGS cells, which contain cadmium. As you probably know, Cd is very toxic. There's currently a lot of work going on to eliminate Cd from all consumer equipment, so this should be solved in time.  In context though, it's important to remember that all of these impacts tend to be minimal compared to the environmental and health implications of coal power. So as long as we're replacing coal, it's still easily a benefit. And, of course, solar isn't much different to many other high tech industries, so it's not like the issues I mentioned above are uniquely problematic.  EDIT: a few people below are correctly pointing out that CIGS is copper-indium-gallium-selenium. However, normally there is cadmium in the buffer layer. There are basically 4 layers: molybdenum -> CIGS -> cadmium sulphide -> doped zinc oxide.
65974	0	a	Thanks so much for all this great information.
65975	0	a	Yes, we have this comparison in the paper I linked above. Generally natural gas has very low impacts - lower than solar - apart from climate change. Which is extremely annoying given that, you know, climate change is immensely important...  EDIT: just to clarify, I was talking about conventional gas here, e.g. from the North Sea. Shale gas cannot be described as 'very low impact'. We also have estimates for shale gas in the paper above, but you'll see that it's very variable depending on industry practices.
65976	0	a	This is called bioregenerative life support, and in falls in the broader category of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Short answer is yes, but not infinite and not without disadvantages.  Note that plants aren't the only way to recycle oxygen. Currently they use water electrolysis to inject oxygen into their atmosphere, and use the resulting hydrogen to apply the Sabatier reaction with CO2. This yields methane as a waste product, and captures oxygen from CO2 in the form of water, so they can later apply electrolysis again and recycle oxygen.  A clear advantage of using plants would be trapping carbon into edible forms, so you'd be recycling not only oxygen but also food. However, not all plants have a 100% edible mass, and those who do usually offer very few calories if not negligible (e.g. lettuce).  A problem with plants is that they could die under some conditions, so this system isn't 100% reliable. And in any case, whether bioregenerative or artificially regenerative, you can never achieve a 100% reuse of ECLSS resources. But it's ok, you can get close enough and have them for a long time relying on very little supplies.  They are actively researching on this topic. Recently they've been able to grow lettuce in the ISS. 
65977	0	a	"Whoa something I can answer - I worked on the Lunar Greenhouse Module at the University of Arizona!   Bioregenerative Life Support Systems could continually produce oxygen and some amount of food (our goal was always atmospheric conditioning with food production as a windfall of that). In fact, you kind of have to decide if you'd like the plants to focus on growing leaves for oxygen production or fruits for food production. Either way, there are a lot of challenges in feeding those plants. We proposed using composters to recycle human waste to make the system fully sustainable, as plants ""breathe"" pure water out which could then be utilized as drinking water as well. I don't know all the details about that part of it, as that wasn't my section. We also intended to use Fresnel lenses with fiber optic cables to deliver sunlight directly to the plants, with blue and red LEDs as a backup (it'd be placed underground because the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris).  Unfortunately, hydroponics would have difficulty in a low gravity environment like the ISS without some real specialized design, which the plants may not like. The moon would give us an environment that is a little more familiar to us and the plants.

65978	0	a	How many plants would you need to create enough oxygen for, say, 6 men? I'm imaging a LOT of plants would be needed
65979	0	a	I've seen different estimates for those requirements, ranging from a few 10s of m^2 to 100s of m^(2) per person. Most likely that it depends a lot on what you're planning to plant, and everyone has a different concept for that. How many plants is even harder to answer because they range a lot in size (i.e. you can have many small plants or few big ones).  What they all agree is that each person needs around 2500 kcal/day of food and 0.5-0.8 kg/day of oxygen.
65980	0	a	On top of that, the amount of oxygen increases and decreases throughout the life cycle of either plants or algae. So at some point you would either have an abundance of oxygen (when fires would easily start) or a deficit. If the plants are just meant as a supplement that's all well and fine, but if you're planning to switch them out completely that becomes another issue to plan around.
65981	0	a	"you could do that with plants as well (plant in rotations), assuming you are controlling environment and dont have a ""growing season""."
65982	0	a	"It's all controlled by lighting, really, so no ""growing seasons"".  The biggest problem you actually have is watering plants, as well as the gravitropic response (roots down, plant up).  With no gravity, you tend to have some unusual effects.  We actually have a small centrifuge on many of our tests to generate artificial gravity, but large scale is obviously difficult.  I don't think there's enough space for this to be feasible on the ISS or deep space missions. "
65983	0	a	The easy answer is no. If you mean combustion (or burning) of the bread, then there would be less calories because once combustion occurs (even partial) the byproducts are either indigestible or barely so.   If you mean dark toast, the kind you might get at 6 on the toaster, it has the same calories. The Maillard reaction is what drives browning and it is a complex process where proteins denature and bind to other proteins as well as carbohydrates and so forth created an amalgam of mixed molecules. Essentially this is what leads to that caramel/nuttiness you get when things are browned. However, this conformational change and denaturation does not decrease the calories because the overall building blocks are the same and still digestible.  However, if let’s say a byproduct of a Maillard reaction is an indigestible molecule that was previously digestible, you could argue that it is now lower in caloric value because it is no longer bioavailable energy.   Side note, a lot of people are talking about measuring calories by using a bomb calorimeter aka burning the item. This is no longer the method used for finding caloric value of food. Instead they find the net average of Atwater bioavailable nutrients and then use standardized values (e.g. 4 Kcal/g for Carbohydrates) to calculate the assumed caloric value. Again, this is obviously dependent on bioavailable sources of energy, not overall stored energy.  A perfect example of how a bomb calorimeter is not a feasible option, is Lettuce. Excluding the water (which is 95% of the material) lettuce is primarily fiber. Insoluble fiber in this case or in other words fiber we cannot breakdown (Cellulose). This material has no caloric value to us because it is not bioavailable (aside from small amounts created by gut fermentation thanks to helpful bacteria). So a piece of lettuce has a net caloric value of basically 0 in the Atwater system. In a bomb calorimeter however, it might have a much higher value because inside each of those cellulose walled cells is stored sugars, proteins, and so forth. Additionally, cellulose is essentially a starch made up of Beta-Glucose, however Beta-glucose is in a different conformation than Alpha-Glucose in starches we digest which means it is incompatible with our enzymes. However, combustion wise, cellulose and amylose (Alpha-glucose polysaccharide aka starch to most people) are equivalent in “Calories” in the context of a bomb calorimeter.    Again, this is not the case in bioavailability. The only animals that can actually get the full caloric potential from plant material are foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters, aka Cows and Horses. This is why they need multiple stomachs or a large cecum, in order to host helpful microorganisms to breakdown cellulose. Even Termites are not able to digest cellulose, but usually carry symbiotic organisms that can.   https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/  Addl. Note: /u/chuggsipas pointed out the fact that to be totally accurate about this discussion we have to really highlight that a Calorie at its base definition is the amount of energy required in order to raise one gram of water, by one degree Celsius. It’s important to distinguish this because while I do mention that a bomb calorimeter is not used for nutritional labeling values, it is the correct way to calculate calories in its true context. Another thing chugg brought up, and I absolutely agree with, is the fact that nutritional calories are a terrible measure of how our body uses energy. We do not just ingest and combust whatever is bioavailable, there are a multitude of processes that are dedicated to metabolism, storage, availability, etc that are not taken into account by flat caloric values. In fact evidence builds every year that quality of foods and caloric sources are more important than the overall calorie value. However, on some very basic level you can get a vague idea of your energy intake with the Atwater calorie system.   Edit: Added some clarification in regards to glucose in Cellulose.  Edit2: Fucked up and did L/D-Glucose instead of Alpha/Beta. Corrected that :X   Edit 3: Just wanted to say thank you to anyone who challenged or questioned anything I wrote. I definitely needed to add some information and make changes here and there. I appreciate it, especially since that’s what healthy discussion is about, and no one can be 100% correct, 100% of the time without some input from others! 
65984	0	a	To go along with this question, as a banana goes from green to yellow to brown it gets sweeter because of I assume sugar.  Does a yellow banana have more calories than green-yellow banana?  I've always wondered.
65985	0	a	Heating up food enough to cause a chemical change (toasting or burning) reduces the total caloric content. However, the heat also tends to make those calories more accessible by breaking down the sugars so your body is more likely to absorb more of them. 
65986	0	a	Bomb calorimetry (by itself) is no longer considered a reliable method for determining the caloric content of food.  The caloric content you see on labels (which I assume is what OP is really interested in) is normally determined using the Atwater method, which accounts for digestibility of food among other factors including calorimetry. 
65987	0	a	I guess this was the old fashioned way.  Today we are able to tell which ingredients are digestible at which efficiency.  Using chemical calculus and also taking the old fashioned way into account brings you closer to how much usable calories a food really has.  Eg. If you burn 1 kg of propane, you get about 110,000 kcal of energy. But if you eat 1 kg of propane, you become a scary surprise for whoever has to burn your body. 
65988	0	a	I forgot to add that some foods increase in caloric value upon cooking them because the nutrients become more bioavailable. A great example of this are potatoes or carrots, where heating the starchy plants causes breakdown and rupture of most of the cells holding starch molecules, which allows the starches to be directly metabolized. So the Atwater caloric value increases, but the actual caloric value (of potential energy for let’s say combustion) has not changed, which again shows you that this is an example of accessibility to nutrients and not overall energy changes. 
65989	0	a	as the fruit ripens large structural sugars start breaking down into smaller more palatable ones. some of these large sugars are not so easily digested, and thus their chemical energy would not be bioavailable for humans.
65990	0	a	For the most part, no. The primary difference lies in that as the banana ripens, complex carbohydrates and starches are broken down into simpler sugars over time. This is why a very ripe banana tastes sweeter than a green banana. Carbohydrates contain 4 kcal/g if they are simple or complex. Complex carbs just take longer to break down, which would also result in the banana's glycemic index changing.  Edit: Wow, people really like talking about bananas.
65991	0	a	"Follow up: would that mean, theres a possibility that burned toast could have ""more"" calories than unburnt. I heard that cooking makes food easier to digest hence more calories?"
65992	0	a	This is why humans cook food. Gotta feed the gigantic brain nutrients and calories (its huge compared to the rest of our body). Also why I find the raw food movement a tad questionable. Unless it's for weight loss. 
65993	0	a	So you're saying greener bananas are harder to digest?
65994	0	a	Yes, you are right. Experiments on snakes found they absorbed 60% more calories from cooked food when compared to uncooked, and humans as similar.   But it also depends on the foods themselves. Some, like milk, eggs, fruit and many more are pretty much the same, cooked or uncooked. Plants and meat yield more nutrients and energy when cooked - eg a raw carrot is nowhere near as useful than a cooked carrot.  Humans have a significantly shortened gut when compared to what it 'should' be, and that is likely driven by obtaining more calories by cooking. This shortened bowel in turn frees up energy we would otherwise be spending to digest for our brain (or so a really interesting theory on human evolution goes). In short: cooking allowed our brain to expand.  EDIT: but note that this might not extend to this scenario since the bread was already milled to flour, fermented and cooked. All those processes make it easier for us to extract calories. Toasting might not add anything here, and certainly does reduce calories fractionally by burning sugars and starches we would otherwise digest.
65995	0	a	I've only recently learned about how much calories our brain actually requires. With such a large brain to body mass ratio, it seems obvious that we need to consume more calories than our bodies would normally be able to absorb raw. Large animals with large brains and correspondingly large digestive systems, like elephants, can eat all day to fuel their brains. But we needed to compensate for our comparatively small digestive systems, so we began cooking food before consumption. This also means we wouldn't need as much food to satisfy our caloric requirements, meaning less hunting and gathering and more time to make tools, invent religion and language, and raise children.  >Glucose is virtually the sole fuel for the human brain, except during prolonged starvation. The brain lacks fuel stores and hence requires a continuous supply of glucose. It consumes about **120 g daily**, which corresponds to an energy input of about **420 kcal (1760 kJ)**, accounting for some **60% of the utilization of glucose by the whole body in the resting state**. Much of the energy, estimates suggest from 60% to 70%, is used to power transport mechanisms that maintain the Na+-K+ membrane potential required for the transmission of the nerve impulses. The brain must also synthesize neurotransmitters and their receptors to propagate nerve impulses. Overall, glucose metabolism remains unchanged during mental activity, although local increases are detected when a subject performs certain tasks. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/
65996	0	a	He's saying in a green banana the sugar is there, but you won't be able to extract it until it turns yellow.
65997	0	a	Why were snakes used in those experiments? I've never actually seen a study where snakes were used
65998	0	a	 > Experiments on snakes found they absorbed 60% more calories from cooked food when compared to uncooked, and humans as similar  Well damn. All those games where cooked food gives you more health is actually kinda correct!
65999	0	a	"> But we needed to compensate for our comparatively small digestive systems, so we began cooking food before consumption.  To put this into evolutionarily-accurate terms, we didn't start cooking one day (or over the course of generations) because our brains had gotten so big that we *had* to cook. There was nothing in our instincts to say ""I need more calories! Cook those potatoes!""  The more plausible explanation would be that our brain size had been limited by our calories *until* pre-humans started cooking. Once these smaller-brained ancestors started cooking, there were more calories available, and so larger brains became possible (or, specifically, they became a positive fitness, rather than a negative one).  (That's all under the assumption that bigger brains require cooking, of course, which is actually [not well supported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842772/).)"
66000	0	a	He's really saying that their chemical energy would not be bioavailable for humans.
66001	0	a	I don't know for sure (this is just a vaguely educated guess), but snakes seem like a great animal to learn about digestion from. Firstly, they expend very little energy by moving around, so immediately you've got a pretty decent control on your digestion environment.   Secondly, they have a stomach pH really similar to a human (around 1.5 ish, ours is between 1.5 and 3.5ish).   Thirdly, the fact that they don't move much when they're digesting (it takes up all their energy) combined with their really simple body shapes allows scientists to use monitoring equipment on them really easily. It's easy to put a sensor with a wire on it on a piece of food and have said snake eat it whole (and not chew it to pieces). The snake is too busy sleeping and digesting to notice a wire from a probe coming out of its mouth and it allows for pretty comprehensive monitoring of all the things going on in its stomach.  I don't know exactly why for sure and the actual reason for that's particular experiment might be different, but those factors make a lot of sense to me.   EDIT: here's a source that vaguely backs up my tenuous attempt at an explanation:  http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/10/1600
66002	0	a	Sorry. Starches are just as bioavailable as sugars, they just take longer to absorb.
66003	0	a	A plantain is a banana, it’s just not a Cavendish. There are different cultivars of banana, and the Plantain is one that has a higher starch content so it has found prolific use as a “cooking banana”. 
66004	0	a	If they’re encased in vacuoles behind cellulose cell walls they’re much harder to access. 
66005	0	a	As inhuman snakes are it's still safe to presume it's more accurate than setting the food on fire.

66008	0	a	You don't need gravity to yoyo. Think of how you can throw a yoyo out perpendicular to the ground and have it return.  The way a yoyo works is this: the string isn't tight to the bearing which is how you can walk the dog etc. If you cause enough snap, it starts to wind, then due to the spinning, causes it to wind back on the string itself. Gravity plays no real part in basic yoyoing, only in certain tricks
66009	0	a	Yes. A yo-yo's functionality is not based on gravity.  You throw it, the string strains, and bounces back.  To be honest, a Yo-yo in space would bounce back harder I believe.  The gravity would not be affecting the yo-yo's repercussion. Long story short, yes, it would actually make a yo-yo more effective; or annoying depending on how you treat it.
66010	0	a	"Wow, nice video. If he can hold the ""around the world"" trick for 1.5 hours straight (one full ISS orbit) it will be the first time that a Yoyo would go completely around the world while doing ""around the world."" Probably.﻿"
66011	0	a	Am I right in thinking that extended periods in freefall can cause the sinus issues that he seems to have in the video?
66012	0	a	> perpendicular to the ground   Parallel?
66013	0	a	Sadly even the longest spinning yo yo's can't currently do that. We've focused too much on space technology and not enough on yo yo technology and now we're suffering for it. 
66014	0	a	Yes, in a zero-g environment fluids get pulled into your upper body (head and chest) and gives astronauts a puffy face and skinny legs.   Don Pettit also has naturally a bit of a weird accent/way of talking.
66015	0	a	he means parallel, but you can also throw a yoyo perpendicular to the ground and have it return
66016	0	a	"Though if we had focused on yo yo technology and not space technology so as to do the ""around the world"" trick for 1.5 hours, we wouldn't have the space technology to fly around the world while doing it. It's quite the conundrum."
66017	0	a	Do they actually get _pulled_ into your upper body, or is it just the result of there being no gravity which usually pulls the fluids _away_ from those areas?
66018	0	a	I actually think he means perpendicular. Just yo-yoing straight up and down. 
66019	0	a	"I feel as though inventing any yo-yo technology advanced enough to make possible a 1.5-hour ""around the world"" would produce the possibility of space flight as a byproduct. Like how *our* space flight technology gave us Tang as a result. We didn't stare up at the Moon and say ""we should create a powdered orange drink with vitamin C, maybe trying to get to the moon will result in that."" But it did.      If a person were to stare up at the moon and try to figure out how to yo a yo-yo with such a sustained yo, space flight is inevitable yo."
66020	0	a	The second one.  Or bodies work to pump liquids into our upper bodies to counter act gravity, but in zero G, you still have your body pumping extra liquid into your upper body, but don't have gravity pulling it away.
66021	0	a	He means parallel.   > You don't need gravity to yoyo. Think of how you can throw a yoyo out perpendicular to the ground and have it return.  That doesn't make sense because gravity affects a yo-yo when you throw it perpendicular to the ground, and it doesn't (much) when you throw it parallel to the ground.  So clearly he meant parallel
66022	0	a	Well that just confirms my theory then. The invention of Tang resulted in space flight. Humans invented the yo-yo long before we started exploring space, if we would have bothered to improve our yo-yo's we would have gotten to space sooner.
66023	0	a	The second one. This would require changing an integral part of how your body distributes fluids.  It might never go away at all, there's not really any selective pressure to make the changes, so it might always be there.
66024	0	a	"Yes, if my understanding of this article is correct: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/science/25qna.html  (I hope nytimes is an acceptable source, even if not academic)  In the linked article, John D. Kubiatowicz, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley says that for a kindle with 4 Gigabyte memory, this would mean a rough increase in weight of 10^–18 grams.  For your situation of a 60GB phone, this would mean  (60Gb/4Gb) * (10^-18 grams) = 1.5 × 10^-17 grams.  So certainly less than what you would be able to feel.  While I originally thought this would be because the storage would use extra electrons, the article/Prof. Kubiatowicz say otherwise:  ""Although the total number of electrons in the memory does not change as the stored data changes,” Dr. Kubiatowicz said, the trapped ones have a higher energy than the untrapped ones. A conservative estimate of the difference would be 10^–15 joules per bit.  ""As the equation E=mc2 makes clear, this energy is equivalent to mass and will have weight.""  It is my understanding that most/all mobile phones use flash memory for storage so the linked article about flash memory in Kindles would be applicable here.  Please let me know (or just delete this outright) if I am mistaken.  *edited to fix exponent formatting    "
66025	0	a	"Most comments here are assuming that ""empty"" space on the phone is occupied by 0 bits, and that new data will switch some to 1. In reality, there's no guarantee that those bits are 0, since most operating systems have clever bookkeeping to allow regions of memory to be marked as empty without having to overwrite that entire section with 0 bits.  Your meta question appears to be: does data have mass? And the answer to that question, and in my mind one of the cool things about data, is that it does not.   A knit quilt with intricate, colorful patterns weighs the same as a gray, featureless one. A book filled with random scribblings weighs the same as an equivalent dictionary. We're a species that evolved to match patterns; data is just patterns: human-interpretable arrangements of things. "
66026	0	a	"As far as I know, it's applicable. But, as the article states, that would be magnitudes less than just fluctuations due to battery level (""one hundred-millionth""). And at that small scale, we wouldn't be able to measure it anyways."
66027	0	a	It would be even less than that because the example is not calculating unused vs used space, it's calculating all bits set to 0 vs all bits set to 1.  EDIT: I was wrong, they accounted for this and the math is for a 50-50 split of 1s and 0s.
66028	0	a	This should be higher up. Even if a 1 has more mass than a 0 or vice versa, memory being more or less full doesn't mean that it will weigh more or less. A phone with 0GB used could have more 1s than a phone with 60GB used.
66029	0	a	"To add to this most storage devices don't have their unused space kept at all 0's, the unused space is usually random 1's and 0's. It's entirely possible that by saving files to your phone you could end up with more 0's and less 1's than you started with and your phone could end up ""lighter""."
66030	0	a	"It's not that you're measuring extra electrons, in fact, the electrons DON'T move from the memory to the battery or vice versa. The number of electrons in the memory stays the same, but the transistors holding a ""high"" value have trapped the electrons in a higher energy state and, therefore, provide more mass."
66031	0	a	According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Block_erasure) flash memory erases to all 1s, so it would *always* be lighter.

66033	0	a	On flash devices empty blocks are usually erased in the background when possible (see [TRIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_\(computing\))), since erasure is an expensive operation and doing it ahead of time means you'll get less hiccups later on when you want to write a bunch of new data quickly.
66034	0	a	Ok, this will likely get buried, but I'll give an explanation.  After you ingest (swallow) water, it goes to your stomach. There, it is slowly released to your small intestine to be absorbed and pass to your bloodstream. It takes water between 10 and 40 minutes to pass to your small intestine and be absorbed. The speed of this depends on how much water, the temperature (cold water will be released slower), if there is something else in the stomach, etc. But, in general, it doesn't matter whether you chug a bottle of water down in 10 seconds or slowly sip it in 10 minutes. It will all end up in your bloodstream in about the same time.  The only thing that can make a difference is whether you vomit the water that you are ingesting. You stomach vomits its contents in response to a series of things (whether it senses that something you ate may be rotten or dangerous, whether there is a bad smell, etc), and one of those things that the stomach takes into account is how full it is. So ingesting water in small sips can help avoid vomiting, and that is what's recommended when for example children have gastroenteritis. But if you don't vomit the water that you swallow, it doesn't matter whether you swallowed it in 10 seconds or 10 minutes.  Edit: Wow, thanks for all the upvotes. Turns out it didn't get buried after all! This is 1/4 of my total karma right there! Glad you liked it!  Edit2: it's actually not clear whether cold water will be released (and thus absorbed) slower. As someone pointed out below, studies on this seem to be contradictory.

66039	0	a	There's no magic number. Just have to pay attention to your body. Learn the early signs of being thirsty and anticipate your needs for the day. Sitting in an office? You won't need much water. Moving around outside all day in any amount of sun or heat? You'll need more than 8-10 glasses.
66040	0	a	I think what you're referring to is the caloric requirements of regulating your body's temperature when adding the colder liquid. Your body will work to keep a stable overall temperature and burns calories to do such.   But someone with more medical knowledge should be able to help with the actual retention of fluid in the stomach. I suspect it's just an increase in heat produced to compensate and the water flows the same no matter what temperature.   Edit: I was incorrect on water retention. Check the rest of the comments for a good explanation.
66041	0	a	That's actually not true. You should drink at certain intervals and not conserve water. It's counter-intuitive but it's the right thing to do.  US Army recommends drinking water at regular intervals. http://www.aircav.com/survival/asch13/asch13p02.html
66042	0	a	In theory, the stomach will be fuller if you drink water, yes. And cold water will take longer to pass. But it's not that simple once you add food and hunger to the equation. First, the food you are eating is likely warmer than your body, so when mixed with the cold water, both will countereffect each other. And, more importantly, how much you want to eat doesn't only depend on how fast you fill up your stomach. It depends partly on how your body interprets what it is eating/drinking. It is a very complex process that involves taste; your brain; the fat, protein, and starch content of what you eat; the spiciness of the food, what foods are available, etc. It's very hard to predict whether drinking cold or hot water is going to make you eat more or less without actually studying in different conditions.  Edit: it turns out that it's not even clear that cold water takes longer to pass. Some studies show that cold water at 4C (close to ice temperature) can pass faster than water at 20C (at room temp).
66043	0	a	I just read on Wikipedia that drinking five to six ice-cold glasses of water would burn an extra 10 calories a day. That would take 6 months to burn 1 lb. of fat.  I don't know about anyone else but that sounds like a lot to me.
66044	0	a	The cool thing about the (large) calorie unit is that it is defined as the energy required to heat 1 litre of water by 1 degree Celsius, which makes this calculation quite easy. If we only look at the energy required to heat the water, and assume ice-cold water is 0 degrees, it'll take 37 calories to heat 1 litre to body temperature. A quick google search reveals that 1lb of body fat contains about 3500 calories of energy, which requires you to drink a little under 100 litre of ice-cold water to burn.
66045	0	a	In general, spiciness will make you feel fuller with a lower amount of food.
66046	0	a	Most of the major points regarding refeeding syndrome and hyponatremia have already been covered in this thread. So I'd like to point out a different issue with severe dehydration. As the body becomes increasingly dehydrated, it becomes increasingly difficult to actually get water in.   This is especially true when you consider one of the most common causes of dehydration is fluid loss due to GI illness. (vomiting and diarrhea). This is even doubly so with infants. It's not possible to rehydrate simply by drinking. You cause more vomiting, more loss, and risk aspirating and drowning. And with dehydration comes hypovolemia. There's so little volume of blood in your veins that they are virtually impossible to start an IV without blowing the vessel.   The most extreme treatment for this is [Intraosseous Infusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraosseous_infusion) , where fluids are injected directly into the bone marrow. In laymen terms, we jam a straw into your shin and pour saline/meds/etc.  There isn't really a point of no return on life, so long as you're still alive. But that's not to say you won't have lasting ill effects. Lifelong dialysis due to kidney failure is a bitch.
66047	0	a	Not entirely sure there is one, but there is Refeeding Syndrome: where the influx of calories in the form of glucose leads to a large amount of insulin release, which in turn causes electrolyte abnormalities, namely hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia, which in particular can lead to arrhythmias and heart failure.
66048	0	a	I see this effect often enough at work as a 911 paramedic. Dying is dying. Doesn’t matter if its on the cusp of thirst, hunger, heart attack, or difficulty breathing, while dying the body reacts the same. As mentioned previously, this effect was also seen in concentration camps. When people are dying they have a physiological strength to hold on until help arrives. Their willpower keeps the body going (placebo effect) until help can intervene. Many times as soon as help walks in the door the victim will stop struggling to live because they can now have someone else worry about that. I see my critical patients decompensate  or get worse often due to this type of response. Edit: as for the second part of your question....yes. Many times they are aware they are dying and are terrified. I’ve also had patients tell me details of the scene afterward while they clinically dead.
66049	0	a	"Rabbits have a condition known as GI Stasis, where food stops being digested, due to a combination of factors, including eating less, less movement of material through the system, and buildup of ""bad"" bacteria in the GI tract.  Humans suffer a superficially similar problem, known as gastroparesis, where the muscles in the GI tract are not working as well as they should, thus material moves more slowly, and less nutrients are absorbed.  So even though you eat something, you may not be able to get any nutrition from it. And that is just one of many mechanisms, you could have issues with production of digestive enzymes, bile, stomach acid, etc, which can stop or slow down absorption.  Another way to look at it, though, is this; if you have a person dying of starvation (or rather, massive organ failure, because of a lack of nutrients), who just died, but their cells are mostly still alive, if you pour food and water down their throats, do they come back to life? Of course not. It's just a question of what fails and how, and that point of no return is probably highly variable, and perhaps subject to what sort of medical care a person can get."

66055	0	a	Black powder is a low explosive, which means I deflagrates rather the detonates.   What that means in lames terms is explosives are measured in how fast they burn, which is what a conventional explosive does, just at a very rapid speed. So as a low explosive black powder in and of itself is not very destructive when compared to a high explosive. What makes black powder effective is containing it. Contain it in a barrel and it will propel a projectile. Contain it in a pipe and it becomes a mechanical explosion causing damage by way of the pipe breaking at great velocity do to build up in pressure (think coke bottle shaken then tossed up in the air). Because it’s a low brisance (ability to cut) it’s not very effective at damaging hardened structures. The main way it would be effective is if it was able to build up enough pressure in the tunnel or building that it was placed it. And other factors like the building materials, amount of earth it was under etc would all factor in. With that, the quality of black powder and amount of moisture as well. There are instances of huge black powder explosions, and instances of not so huge. There would have to be some real study and testing done to say for sure, but what I can promise is that there is no chance it would have gone unnoticed. I hope that answers a least part of the question. I will clarify where I can, if you have questions.

66061	0	a	"Black powder is a low speed explosive, but if it's fine ground and well-tamped, it will just explode just fine. The Oklahoma City bombing was done with ANNM but mostly just straight Ammonium Nitrate, which is even slower than black powderm, and it blew up the Murrah Building no problem.  That much explosive, well-contained (e.g. like an undercroft), would have no problem leveling the building above it. In fact, a low speed explosive is generally better as a ""pushing"" vs ""cutting"" explosive. If you wanted to make steel cutting or counterforce charges to bring down the supports of a building, blackpowder is an awful choice. If you just want to heave up a huge mass of earth, then it does the job just fine."
66062	0	a	Would the fact it was buried under a trench create a high-pressure environment that would amplify the damage? Would it be possible to replicate in the place Fawkes' gunpowder was at? Black powder is much more slowly burning than TNT, and how sealed the environment is could be crucial to determine the built up pressure, and thus the damage.  There is a historic basis how meaningful this is, albeit on a smaller bomb scale. During the [20 July plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot), several German officers tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler using a briefcase bomb. To avoid setting off metal detectors, they had to use plastic explosives wrapped in paper rather than a metal casing, despite the fact that at the time of WWII, plastic explosives were not as advanced or high-pressure as later explosives like C4. They expected Hitler to have a conference in a bunker and had the bomb placed there, where the sealed environment would act like one big casing, allowing the bomb to build up pressure that would kill everyone inside. But instead, Hitler had the meeting in a regular building, with windows and other gaps. As a result, the detonated bomb dissipated its explosive force, and Hitler survived the explosion, albeit with some injuries like a shattered eardrum.

The brisance of black powder is substantially less than TNT, and the confinement would be rather less than when buried.  Plus, there's no telling the condition of the gunpowder (moist versus dry) nor how well it was made.  But even if it didn't destroy the building, it probably would have rendered it unusable.

66065	0	a	The House of Lords is actually just a single chamber inside of the Palace of Westminster which is a much larger building. For this recreation it looks small because they only recreated the House of Lords and the basement underneath it rather than model the entire Palace of Westminster which would've been a gargantuan task. Since the House of Lords was where the targets would be and all of the gunpowder would be in the basement beneath, they only needed to build those two to see how large the explosion would've been.
66066	0	a	This would have been a major issue. Some of the powder would have detonated, but much of the gunpowder would have been dispersed and burned. 
66067	0	a	"In an enclosed environment, the TNT equivalency for black powder is about right as an estimate of the damage it would cause. The pressure would cause the reaction rate to go up high enough that it would almost certainly be a detonation. Contained black powder can do real damage.   If you want a laugh, lookup ""anvil shooting"" on Youtube. It's mental.  This Hitler thing is really interesting. Human bodies are remarkably resilient to short duration overpressure and laymen tend to underestimate just how fast pressure drops off with distance. Without an enclosure like a room to reflect the pressure back or some sort of shrapnel, straight up lumps of high explosive are remarkably ineffective at killing humans for how much energy there is.

66073	0	a	"Early on in the history of computing, programs would be written as a sequence of operations in assembly language, which basically means they would be written in terms of actual physical operations for the computer architecture to perform, e.g. copy this numeric value to that memory location.  That's obviously very time consuming and difficult, and it means that programs have to be rewritten for each new type of processor that you run them on. So to make it easier, higher level languages that are more human readable were created, with commands that basically work as shortcuts for all the repetitive number-juggling required in assembly language. So you have to write a compiler in assembly language, which doesn't require compiling.   It's interesting that you ask ""did **he** compile it at all"", since the first person to write a compiler was actually a woman, Grace Hopper :)"
66074	0	a	This confusion comes from a misunderstanding about what compiling is.  These days we commonly say we don't work in bits or machine code. That isn't exactly true. People who work in hardware do work in bits when they're developing a new kind of circuit.  When microprocessors were first created everybody worked with bits. Flip this to on and then that causes this and you can flip these to represent a number and flip this switch to move it into a special register and picked up by the clock.  At first that worked fine. Kind of the way you don't need labels for the 20 or so light switches in your house. But after a while they wanted a) more complicated systems and b) people with less experience to be able to contribute.  So that's when early forms of what we would call assembly language came on. It abstracted all the little switches away into a smaller set of instructions like move data, add data, subtract data etc.  Pretty soon after that things got too complicated again so some people who found themselves writing the same combinations and order of these instructions sought to abstract these hundreds of lines of simple instructions into a single line instruction. So they wrote a program that would take a program of five lines in this new langauge and convert it into the hundreds of lines of assembly language.  This has happened multiple times over and each time the compiler/interpreter etc is written by people who *can* write in the lower level language the compiler produces but would rather save themselves the keystrokes.  EDIT: My source is 22 years of programming, 18 years of software engineering. These days I leverage some of the lessons and motivations for developing compilers into developing custom tooling for other software engineers in mid to large scale organizations.
66075	0	a	Please bear with the first bit of this as I establish a framework understanding.  Machines execute machine code. Compilers do *not* compile directly to machine code. They compile the code into to *assembly* which is then *assembled* into machine code.  Machine code has two parts, ~~zero and one~~ operands (what to do and where (registers) to do it\*) and data. Depending on the number of 'bits' the machine is, these can all have varying lengths of bits.  Now that we understand what machine code is and how it's structured, let's look at what assembly code is.  Assembly code is *human readable machine code*.  We (humans) give the operands *mnemonics* (names) and logically divide this into three parts to make things easier to remember for us. No matter what, the same operand mnemonic will *always* turn into the same sequence of binary.   So assembly let's us turn a 'line' of binary from      010011110101000001010010 010100100100010101000111 01000100010000010101010001000001  Into      OPR REG, DATA  So now we know what assembly is, and how it's written. How does a machine turn assembly into machine code?  Why with an assembler of course! Usually assemblers are 'programmed' on paper, by hand writing the assembly you would normally type to later be run through an assembler. The next step is. . . Translating the assembly of your assembler to binary yourself! Hooray how exciting!  Even still we keep it a bit more human readable than direct binary we use a system called hexadecimal to represent binary. A symbol of hex is four bits, and is as follows.      0 0000     1 0001     2 0010     3 0011      ...     F 1111   Once you have your program translated from assembly to hex, you queue the program in a hex editor. A hex editor is a peripheral attached to the machine which stores the binary of your program which you enter using hex, and sends it to be executed once you are finished.  So, now we understand how we get machines to do anything. Let's see how we can reach the ability to compile a compiler.  1) Hand write an assembler in assembly/hex.  2) Enter your assembler into a machine with a hex editor  3) Write your compiler in assembly and assemble it.  4) Write your compiler in the language your compiler compiles.  5) Assemble the compiler.  6) GOTO 4  That's how you get a basic compiler.   Fun fact: A compiler written in the language it compiles is called a *self-hosting compiler*.   ***  Things you may want to dig into for further reading.

66078	0	a	Slightly off topic but may be mildly interesting: people still code in assembly even to this day for small low-power processors such as DSPs where every clock cycle counts. It’s getting less and less common as C compilers are more efficiently targeted to these custom devices, but it still happens in a lot of places.   Of course, it’s not exactly the same process as the early days. Instead of memorising / looking up the sequence of 1s and 0s for “store number 1 in register r2” you write a statement such as “str 1, r2” and the toolchain translates that to the appropriate binary. It’s like an intermediate layer between the machine code and the higher level code. And you get a pretty-ish IDE running on your desktop rather than using punchcards. But overall you still have to have an in-depth knowledge of the underlying processor hardware and its capabilities, and the patience of a saint :) for what it’s worth, some people really enjoy it.

66081	0	a	This is correct. And I think it's useful to understand that most compilers are compiled iteratively, called bootstrapping: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)  As an example: Rust is written in Rust and compiled with the Rust compiler. They did this by first writing a bare-bones Rust compiler in OCaml, used that compiler to compile a Rust compiler written in Rust, and then began compiling each new version of Rust with the previous version's compiler. OCaml does the same thing: it's written in OCaml that was bootstrapped with a compiler written in C. C itself is written in C, and was bootstrapped with an assembler. The assembler itself translates assembly language to machine code which is what actually runs on the processor.  So once we got the first steps down (e.g. C to assembly to machine code) everything was built up from there.

They were more like a typewriter where you could press something that had a meaning, and that would punch the instruction/value into the card. I guess you could call that a very low-level type of assembly compilation... albeit physically implemented.

66090	0	a	"I've programmed in Fortran using keypunch cards (college, mid-70's).  Each card was a line of Fortran code.  Or assembly code, or whatever.  The punch card was simply a means to get the data into the computer's memory (whatever that data might be).    Keypunch machines really were quite simple.  Typewriter like keyboard like you said and if you typed ""A"" it would punch the pattern for an ""A"" on the card in some ASCII-like code.  Each card would hold 80 (I think?) characters (think bytes).  The cards themselves could probably be thought of as a primitive form of storage.    The keypunch machines weren't connected to the computer.  Instead, after you typed your program into a ""deck of cards,"" you'd submit the cards to a computer operator.  The operator would run them through a card reader which was the actual input device on the computer.  If you made an error in a line of code, you'd retype that one card and replace it in the deck and resubmit it for another run.  All output was on 11x17 ""bluebar"" tractor-fed paper which came off a high-speed line printer that used actual ink ribbons.    Computer of course was a mainframe like you'd see in a 1940's horror flick.  Fun stuff - haven't thought of this in awhile."
66091	0	a	That's how I found out that the maximum line number for errors in a C program is 65536. (Years ago). You get a warning that the C compiler cannot show the line number if there is a error.    It was a compiler that generated C code.
66092	0	a	The Rust spec wasn't really done in any sense by the time that the OCaml compiler was first created. Usually compiler projects are eager to get themselves self-hosting in part because it creates a large project in the language itself that's going to need a lot of libraries and such to be created within it, thus serving as the genesis for an ecosystem. But it also has the benefit of lessening external dependencies and allowing those who later want to contribute to Rust to do so with their knowledge of Rust specifically, not needing to know OCaml.   If I remember correctly for a while rustc wasn't really written in completely natural rust, it was written in a subset that the bootstrapping compiler could understand. Even after the bootstrapping compiler was eliminated, previous versions of rustc had to be able to compile newer versions so of course there was and is some tolerance for compatibility there.  But yeah, it's not esoteric at all, I think it's an effort that can make a language much more sustainable on its own.

66116	0	a	Coat a copper wire in wax and wrap it around a ring of iron. Put a magnetic material in the middle of the ring and rotate it.  You now have an electric generator. Make a water wheel or slaves turn this generator constantly.  Now take some clay pots and some sheep intestines. Tightly wind the intestines in a coil around a copper rod and place them in the pot. Fill the pot with fruit juice. Place another copper rod on the outside edge of the roil of intestines. You now have an electrolytic capacitor.   Same setup as the pot, but without sheep skin coil and the two rods need to be made of different materials and you have a battery.  Build enough capacitors to store enough energy to cause electrical arching.  Use this device to execute your political rivals by putting one side of the circuit on the front and back of the chest directly over the heart.  You now have the power to kill your rivals on touch, granted by the gods.  If you just want impressive static electricity, take a wool cloth strip and rub it over a piece of glass or a really clear piece of quartz. Make a belt of the wool and run it around the glass to make it more automatic. The glass end of the wool will build up a charge. If you put a metal dome over this end with a pointed piece hanging down from the dome to just above the wool you get a static generator capable of some pretty sparks.
66117	0	a	Think of ohms like the size of the pipes, low resistance is akin to a large pipe. A small pipe wouldn't allow a lot of water to flow, high resistance.  Think of volts like a pump, or water pressure. It pushes the water thru the pipe like voltage pushes electricity thru a wire.  And think of amps like the amount of water that goes thru a pipe.  So when you want a lot of water (amps) you need a large pipe (low resistance, or minimum ohms) and a nice big pump (voltage).   The old saying (ohms law) is it takes 1 volt to push 1 amp thru 1 ohm. It's not a great saying because it's easy to get volts and amps turned around.

66124	0	a	No, you're just grasping at straws. They used wool very often back then, and you guys are trying to simplify something that isn't that simple. Ancients must have encountered static electricity at least 20% as much as we do now. That would still be enough that everyone encountered it somewhat regularly (once a year or more).  I believe that people here are trying to act like they know more than they do. Of course ancients encountered static electricity. They must have at least discussed it a little bit. I'd love some actual sources.  Cleanliness wasn't as much of a thing back then, but surely wool on even greasy hair would produce static. 
66125	0	a	"Everyone saying tank that releases water all at once are missing the point of a capacitor.  A capacitor ""resists"" changes in voltage using stored charge.    So in our water analogy, a capacitor would be analogous to a tank that tries to stabilize the pressure in the water.  If the pressure drops, the capacitor adds water to the plumbing to fight the pressure drop.  If the pressure rises, the capacitor sucks some water in to try to drop the pressure.  So a capacitor is most like water pressure regulator I guess?  A fancy one that tries to minimize transient pressure changes."

66128	0	a	"Semiotician W. C. Watt, after much research, concluded that the alphabet ordering descended from an early organization that grouped the letters by their sounds, which might have been used as a teaching tool for language (although that original organization/artifact is now lost). He called it the ""[Ras Shamra Matrix](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/semi.1989.74.issue-1-2/semi.1989.74.1-2.61/semi.1989.74.1-2.61.xml).""  Apparently he hadn't really even considered the question until a student asked him, and he realized he didn't know. However, he thought about the alphabet (A-B-C-D), realized that earlier organizations, like in Hebrew, had Bet-Gimel-Daleth (B-G-D), which are phonetically related, and so it might not be arbitrary. This sent him off on a research quest trying to figure it out."
66129	0	a	Short answer: maybe, maybe not. No one is sure.   Longer answer: The alphabet we use today is something that evolved over ~3,000 years, through 4 iterations minimum:   Phoenician ⇒ Greek ⇒ Latin ⇒ modern languages with letters like J, W, and ß, as well as diacriticals like å and diphthongs like œ.   As a result, there’s no one answer for where the order for a given modern language comes from. The alphabet for English is different from that of French, or Swedish, or Polish. Consider the Hungarian alphabet, which looks like this:  a, á, b, c, cs, d, dz, dzs, e, é, f, g, gy, h, i, í, j, k, l, ly, m, n, ny, o, ó, ö, ő, p, q, r, s, sz, t, ty, u, ú, ü, û, v, w, x, y, z, zs  Now, we can look at that and see that the basic order of the Latin alphabet remains. The additions are just stuck in after the related letters whose sounds they modify. As with English, we have the Latin alphabetical order, plus the later medieval insertions of j and w. The insertions are obvious and easy, because they simply follow the letters they were invented to modify/clarify.   But for the Latin order, it’s trickier. Latin is a blend of Etruscan and Greek, and they adopted neither wholesale. For example, Etruscan had 3 letters for what we would think of a ‘k’ sounds today: C, Q, and K (probably ‘kay’, ‘qoo’ and ‘ka’ but this is a guess since Etruscan remains untranslated). G was a lesser-used sound in Etruscan, but /k/ was very important, so they invented C from G, swapped kappa and gamma in the order, then inserted the ‘other’ k sound further down the line from Ϙ or qoppa , a pre-standardized Greek letter used in some cities.   Long story short, there’s some interesting linguistics research that suggests certain groupings of letters were created intentionally by different groups at different times, and then just kept out of habit by adopters.   So for example, the Beth Gimel Dat sequencing mentioned in a number of other posts was adopted directly into Greek as Beta Gamma Delta, but then the Gamma was replaced with C in Latin.   EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!
66130	0	a	[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi) alphabets are ordered in two different categories: all vowels preceeds the order followed by all the consonants. The ordering is very clever and when you speak in the order, you can notice the subtle movements of the tongue and muscles in a particular way.   For example, the first four consonants are 'Ka', 'Kha', 'Ga', 'Gha'. When you pronounce it you see your tongue rises with every alphabet.

Cultural dominance probably played much more of a role than any innate property; the Phoenicians happened to use Northern Semitic order, so the Greeks happened to keep more or less the same order when they adopted the Phoenician alphabet.  The same question is often asked about [writing directionality](https://imgur.com/a/GUJ4s) among other things, but as this chart shows, current dominance of a linguistic property doesn't necessarily mean that dominance was inevitable (or even foreseeable).

We can also calculate how much stuff is out there by direct observation.  When we look at the cosmos and look at how the galaxies behave, there is not enough material to generate the gravity (even when accounting for all the gas and dust that may obscuring it).  So there's some matter that doesn't emit light but still generates that gravity we see.  We call it dark matter, because that's what it is: dark.  There's also an expansion to the universe that suggests that the energy density is not what we can directly measure.  There's a bunch of stuff out there causing the universe to expand at an accelerated rate.  We call it dark energy, because, hey, we have dark matter already--why not call it ""Dark Energy""; that way it sounds cool.  So there's like 5 times as much matter as what we can see, and like 3 times as much energy density as what can be explained by that matter.  So that's where the percentages come from: just add up all the stuff we know about that makes up the universe even if we don't yet know what that stuff is."
66151	0	a	In layman's terms: dark matter is *something that generates gravity that we can't see*.  We can calculate the gravitational forces that impact everything we can see - stars, planets, black holes, dust, etc. We can calculate how much gravity the things we observe is generating. The problem is, they don't add up. There's way more gravity affecting everything than what is being generated. All of that unexplained gravity is just generalized as dark matter until a better explanation comes along. Same kinda deal with dark energy.
66152	0	a	"For dark matter and ordinary matter, we basically measure the *total* matter first (since it all gravitates the same), then differentiate between the two using a second effect.   The total matter (23%+5%=28%) is roughly given by the ratio of heights of the first and third peaks in the [Cosmic Microwave Background angular powerspectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#/media/File:PowerSpectrumExt.svg) because the third peak mostly evolved (by gravity) when the matter content of the universe was negligible, and the first peak mostly evolved when the universe was matter dominated. So the third peak is kind of a calibrator letting the first peak tells you how much matter there is.  To differentiate just the ""ordinary matter"" part, you can get that from the CMB too, but an even cooler way is by measuring how much of various atomic elements there are in the universe in little pockets that appear to have been pristinely left from the Big Bang. In these pockets, you see that something like 24% of the atoms are Helium-4. The amount of Helium-4 formed by the Big Bang depends really sensitively on how much ordinary matter there was, i.e. the ordinary atoms that are the building blocks of Helium. Run the math and that 24% number tells you about 5% of the universe is normal matter. Then 28%-5% and you get the part which is ""missing"", i.e. dark matter.   As for dark energy, well we've just measured how much matter there is (I actually cheated a bit above, those things tells you the total amount of matter, not the percentage relative to everything), so we can calculate how much all that matter gravitating in on itself should slow the expansion of the universe. Then you go and measure the expansion and find, lo-and-behold, not only is the expansion not slowing, its accelerating! Using supernovae as beacons to precisely measure the acceleration rate, you work out how much dark energy there is, giving you that 72% number.  There's probably like 10 other ways to measure these things than what I just described, cosmologists are constantly looking for new ways to do so and comparing the answers against each other, in hope to find a crack in the model pointing to some new things we don't understand!  "
66153	0	a	Could these phenomena just be (but probably not likely) an incomplete understanding of how physical laws, which are already discovered, work?
66154	0	a	>Same kinda deal with dark energy.  Dark energy is whatever is doing the work to accelerate the expansion of spacetime. Why We knew that the universe is expanding, bit it seems like the RATE at which it's expanding was itself increasing. What's causing this acceleration? There has to be some energy that we can't see. But it's got nothing to do with the gravity or the warping of space time.  There was some talk that the observations which demonstrated an accelerating exclamation couldn't be replicated with better equipment, and may have even been an error on a single study. But I feel I would have read much more about that since then if it were credible.
66155	0	a	"It's possible that dark matter and dark energy don't actually exist, but this would lead to a more dramatic upheaval than you might be thinking. A absolute disproving of dark matter would likely lead us to throw out most of modern astrophysics. As you might imagine, this would also be pretty hard to accomplish, what with it not reacting to light and all.  These kinds of additions have been revoked before, though. Aether was introduced into early scientific models to give light a material to travel through (much like sound and other waves need). The famous ""Michelson–Morley experiment"" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)) showed this couldn't be the case, and so science moved on to realize that Light was made of Photons and therefore didn't need a material to transmit.  Other examples exist, but for now we know that if our observations are correct and that there our current model is accurate to some respect, then some matter exists that we can't see."
66156	0	a	So should we think of dark matter like how we assumed there was the luminiferous aether up until the Michelson-Morley experiment & special relativity?
66157	0	a	[Tired light](http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/tiredlit.htm) has been debunked. It does not work. The universe would look different if it was real. 
66158	0	a	Yes - that's how we know it's there, because it has gravity. The first way it was directly detected was in the rotation speeds of galaxies, which are too fast for the amount of matter we can see. But gravitational lensing, which is the bending of light by massive objects, is something we can see directly and tells us quite precisely how much mass in in a certain area. Spoiler - lots more than we can see. Even tenuous, cold hydrogen gas interacts with light, and that wouldn't explain a lot of other astrophysical phenomena, so this has to be something else.
66159	0	a	Except that's only from hindsight. Light traveling through a vacuum was an observed effect of the aether.    If we find out GR is just wrong and there's actually no dark matter out there, our evidence of the gravity we observed it having is as bad in hindsight as the observation of a wave traveling through a vacuum was for the aether. 
66160	0	a	No, the understanding we have of the ways matter can exist in galaxies means this doesn't really work. When matter (we're mainly talking hydrogen and helium here) get beyond a certain density, stars start to form. Stars emit light, and we understand the masses and densities of stars very well. Matter can of course end up in black holes and a few other dense, exotic objects like neutron stars that we can't directly see, but by and large we understand pretty well how many of these could be formed for every number of visible stars we see.  Our working model of the universe suggests quite strongly that galaxies form inside big clumps of invisible dark matter - that it's the gravity of the dark matter clumps that helps the gas to fall in and eventually get dense enough to form stars and galaxies. These dark matter halos we can measure with gravitational lensing and other ways. Despite the totally unknown nature of dark matter, it's really hard to explain all the other stuff we see without it.
66161	0	a	The difference is that dark matter is a placeholder for an effect describing our observation. The name dark matter doesn’t necessarily assume it’s matter or any other effect. Luminiferous aether did assume the cause of an effect, it assumed the solution to medium-less wave propagation. Our observations are accurate in terms of raw data, the question of why our observations differ from theory are all summed up together in the name dark matter. Dark matter is merely the name for the phenomena because it’s the simplest and most obvious explanation, but that explanation is not presumed.   Edit: Luminiferous Arthur is a respected scientist and you should all be ashamed! ^/s

That link goes to Greenland and reportedly has had frequent issues since it was built due to poor construction. Aside from this Greenland link, all other wired Canadian internet traffic goes through the US first before going to the rest of the world. The US could effectively cut Canada off from the internet if it wanted to.  >However, there is a proposal to built a new, modern fiber link through the Canadian arctic that would link London, UK with Tokyo, Japan. This would significantly reduce latency between Western Europe and East Asia while also bypassing the mainland US. It would also provide gigabit internet access to thousands of remote Inuit communities in the Canadian Arctic, which could have life changing effects on their economies.  **UPDATES**  Thanks to /u/RcNorth and /u/markszpak for highlighting [this more detailed map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/submarine-cable/gtt-atlantic) than the ones I based the previous version of this comment on. This more detailed map clearly shows that there are 3 fiber links from Halifax to the UK in addition to a fiber link up to Greenland that I mentioned previously.  However as described by /u/SoontobeSam:  >As a former network operations technician for a Canadian ISP, this is correct, telegreenland's cable is the only subsea fiber I am aware of that does not enter the US before Canada, our other main access routes are in Toronto and Vancouver, but both connect to the US to access international networks. I can also confirm that their network uptime is mostly ok, but when they do have issues it takes forever to get any progress and dealing with ongoing non outage issues is difficult, also Newfies and Scots have a serious language barrier even though they're both speaking ""English"".  So while my initial remarks regarding the US basically being the gatekeeper for Canada's access to the wider Internet may be more or less correct, I was incorrect in saying that the Greenland fiber link is the ONLY fiber link Canada has to the rest of the world. While the Toronto, Halifax, and Vancouver links /u/SoontobeSam mentioned appear to all go through the US in some way first which technically restricts Canada's direct access through those links.  **Arctic Fiber**  By popular request here is [the link to the site](http://qexpressnet.com/system/) for the fiber link through the Canadian Arctic that I mentioned previously. The project was formerly known as Arctic Fiber, but has been re-branded as the Quintillion Cable System after the name of the company task with installing the cable. Yes, you read that right, this project has gotten the green light since I last checked up on it (I didn't have time to check on my way to work when I commented originally). They just completed Phase 1 which covers Alaska, and will be starting the Phase 2 to expand through Asia to Tokyo soon. Quintillion has also built a terrestrial link through Alaska and down to the mainland US in order to provide connection to existing connection hubs on the west coast.  *UPDATE 2: Just have to highlight these two awesome users comments:*  User /u/KrazyTrumpeter05 posted [an awesome comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7ez85x/with_all_this_fuss_about_net_neutrality_exactly/dq9ir7v/) with more info about Canadian Fiber connections, and also linked to [this 293 report](http://subtelforum.com/products/submarine-cable-almanac/) they claim to have played a major role in writing about Internet Fiber connections around the world. Thanks for the fascinating info!  User /u/Fochang1 posted [this fascinating comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7ez85x/with_all_this_fuss_about_net_neutrality_exactly/dq9ic13/) about how South American/Caribbean nations have a similar issue with the US acting as their Internet gatekeepers. They linked to [this insane Internet Exchange Point](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAP_of_the_Americas) in Miami that routes most of South/Central America's internet traffic. Thanks for sharing this incredible perspective that Canadians like myself would otherwise be oblivious to!  **Some thoughts on the impact of Arctic Fiber** The fact that this project is actually being built is incredible, because it will mean a huge boost in connection for remote arctic communities that open up massive new economic and information exchange opportunities to these historically very isolated regions. I can't wait to see what the Inuit peoples of Canada's arctic will do with this new link to the outside world. Reconciliation between Canada's indigenous and non-indigenous peoples has become a major focus for Canada in recent years, with the Canadian government [set to fully implement into law](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-backs-undrip-bill-1.4412037) a 2007 [UN declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html). There is a long way to go for reconciliation, and it has been a very rocky road so far, but I hope that this new Fiber link will open up new ways for a large portion of Canada's indigenous population to showcase their own culture to the world and make new economic opportunities for their communities in the digital marketplace.  If you for some reason read through everything to this point, thanks for reading :)"
66163	0	a	I would like to know what the ISPs are thinking of Elon Musk's (and others) notion of covering the planet with satellite based service, and how would they compete with that? It seems inevitable that this is in some form the future of internet. And then as an aside, will the competition be companies throwing up MORE satellites? 
66164	0	a	"See [this](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Internet_access_in_households_by_degree_of_urbanisation,_2016_\(%25_of_all_households\)_YB17.png) and [this](http://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/what-percentage-of-american-homes-have-a-computer/) and [this](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/19/census-computer-ownership-internet-connection-varies-widely-across-u-s/). Also check [here](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/) and [here](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/europe-population/). You can see the percentages of households with a computer and internet access is in both around 70% - 80%, just pick 75% for ease of calculation, US having 330mln citizens and EU having 750 mln, that means that there are at least, respectively, 250 mln US citizens with access to internet, and in EU 560 mln. To achieve the best internet experience the datacenters for all big companies that everyone uses are spread across the world, with the concentration of datacenters being proportional to the traffic. Knowing EU has twice as many internet users as US, logically there should be, and probably are - more datacenters in EU than in US. This means that impact on EU will be low but it can lead to other unforeseen consequences outside of ""just the internet"". Same counts for other regions like Canada, South America, Asia, Australia (they have shit internet anyways) and Africa. Biggest impact (in order) I expect this to have is: Canada, EU, South America, Asia, Australia, Africa. Look for example how IBMs datacenters are [spread around the world](https://prnewswire2-a.akamaihd.net/p/1893751/sp/189375100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_ny63t7c4/def_height/2700/def_width/2700/version/100011/type/1?.jpg). Other big companies probably have the same spread. This would confirm which regions of the world would be fucked most by US net neutrality laws being repealed. Also check out [Azure's datacenters spread](http://africatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/microsoft-804x452.jpg) and [Google's datacenters spread](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2345/2404505335_9f06ed86ac_o.jpg).   [Here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/complete-white-paper-c11-481360.html) you can see US will account for ""only"" (still a big chunk though) 30% of the worlds internet traffic in 2021 (maybe that will change with the laws repealed though). But there's still the 70% of traffic outside US.  [Worldwide](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS) 45% of the population has internet access one way or another (for 7 bln people that makes 3.15 bln). Of those 3.15 bln users, US counts for 250 mln, or just shy of 8% of the worlds internet population. This means other internet traffic is generated by 92% of the rest population in the world.  So, as of now the 8% of internet worldwide internet population located in US generates 30% of the internet traffic while 92% of the world generates 70% of the traffic.. well good for Americans I guess, that will make the impact a bit heavier on the rest of the world?..  As for other unforeseen consequences, think of intercontinental shipping, they need to send data between them to coordinate stuff, slow it down and it could mean your shipping container gets delayed by a week? Maybe this is an exaggeration but who knows.."
66165	0	a	I’m unclear if this FCC “ruling” will only allow them to throttle connections to their subscribers down stream. This post infers that services hosted in US data centres can have their UP connections throttled no matter where the user is. Nothing surprises me about what is happening there, but this would really be pushing it. If US data centres are affected like this, Canadian & Mexican data centres are about to see a lot of new business.  Edit: Make more readable.

66169	0	a	I hate to be the guy to tell you this but.... If this Net Neutrality stuff is repealed, and valve doesn't pay up then all steam server access will be significantly slowed.  Bottom line is internet is a network of sub-networks. These sub-networks are owned by ISPs and they make deals to allow one another to route packets through their cables. If this net neutrality stuff is repealed, although the rest of the routing around the world wouldn't be effected much, any routing via the US, or from the US will be subject to the bandwidth limits set by their ISPs.  Think of it as a pipe it doesn't matter how large the pipes are, if there is one section of the pipe that is really small then that is the limiter of the throughput of the entire system. 
66170	0	a	Low Earth Orbit (which SpaceX's plan involves) latency is actually pretty low. We are talking about the ballpark of [25ms](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-will-launch-thousands-of-broadband-satellites/), not the traditional hundreds of milliseconds that geosynchronous orbits have.  The only issue is you need more satellites to cover the area and since they move around relative to ground, more advanced antennas that can track them.
66171	0	a	> valve doesn't pay up then all steam server access will be significantly slowed.  I would be shocked if they didn't already have servers outside the US, and if they don't, it wouldn't take much to do so.

66173	0	a	It's unbelievable. The most important communication tool in all of human history is about to be crippled so that a tiny group of people can afford new yachts.
66174	0	a	That is an extremely optimistic estimate. You'll have 14 ms just from the speed of light if bouncing from one satellite. That means they are leaving only 10 ms for all the terrestrial transmission, routing, etc.. Given the SNR is not going to be great, you can't expect much in terms of bandwidth either.
66175	0	a	Fun Fact! Many huge internet companies have massive datacenters in remote northern Sweden and Finland because half of the year it costs nothing to cool the place down, which is the main expenses associated with a datacenter, I bet it only takes a few years for the cost of refrigeration to outstrip the cost of servers in centers closer to the equator.
66176	0	a	Where did you get the 14ms figures? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_satellite_constellation), the satellites are going to be 1110 to 1325 km high. If you are directly below it (just to simply the trigonometry math), 1 325 000 m / 299 792 458 (m/s) = 4.4 ms, one way. Roundtrip would be 8.8 ms.
66177	0	a	We should liquid cool the datacenters and route all the water to jacuzzis and spas and heated pools. Win win.
66178	0	a	You're thinking too small, have the heat power stills, water goes in, absolut vodka comes out. Once the vodka is there the hot tubs will follow. (saunas if you wanted to be authentic) 
66179	0	a	Well, the whole point of this endeavor is to send enough satellites up that you won't be communicating with satellites on the horizon. Otherwise this obviously won't work.  There's a reason why it's SpaceX that's doing this. They currently have a monopoly on low-cost reusable rockets, and this reusability opens up new venues that weren't previously available. They only reuse first stage right now, but their next rocket, BFR, is going to be designed with full reusability which would make the marginal cost to only be the satellite (which they are claiming is going to cheap), fuel (methane), and maintenance.  When SpaceX first started to do reusability rockets it may have seemed pointless, as space launches were infrequent, but what that did was opening up completely new uses for satellites that would otherwise have been too costly to be practical.
66180	0	a	"As several people have pointed out, the question is not [""what is Jupiter's structure""](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duunoak/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=askscience) or [""When did scientists realize that Jupiter had an atmosphere""](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duupzwm/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=askscience), it's ""when did scientists realize it had no solid ground?"".  It's about the *history* of knowledge of the interior composition.  Since, [recent spacecraft results](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duuorz9/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=askscience) suggest it may gradually transition into something like a small solid core, let's interpret the question as, ""When did we first realize that Jupiter wasn't a rocky planet""?  To solve this problem, you need to calculate the mass of Jupiter and its size, so you can find its *density*.  The mass of Jupiter can be calculated using Newtonian orbital mechanics, provided you know the orbital period and orbital diameter of its moons.  Period is easy, but a major historical problem in solar system studies was finding the relative scale of *everything*: it's easy to measure angles and relative sizes with a telescope, but we need the actual length dimensions.  You need a baseline distance to start with, such as the distance from the Earth to the Sun: this was worked out [in the late 1600s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#History): from that, the size of Jupiter, the size of its moons' orbits, and thus its mass and density could be found.  So even before 1700, astronomers realized that Jupiter was 300 times the mass of Earth, but with a density much less than that of rock.  Since the density known today is about 1.4 times that of water, I suppose that without knowledge of high-pressure physics they couldn't rule out a liquid water or ice planet, but scientists have known for over 300 years that Jupiter is definitely not a rocky world.  H. G. Wells was a fantastic writer, but he maybe wasn't so meticulous about doing his library research.

66181	0	a	Giovanni Cassini observed the different latitudes of Jupiter rotated at different rates in 1690. He concluded the planet could not be solid - ie was liquid or gas because a solid planet would not allow differential rotation
66182	0	a	One thing to add is [differential rotation](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Differential+Rotation), which basically means that different parts/regions of a celestial body rotate at different speeds. So a solid planet would rotate in alignment across all latitudes while gas objects (sun, Jupiter) typically have equatorial regions that rotate more quickly than areas closer to the poles.  > Examples of differential rotation are found throughout astronomy. In stars (including the Sun) and the gas giant planets, the equatorial regions rotate faster than regions closer to the poles, meaning that equatorial sunspots and cloud formations will move across the face of the object faster than their polar cousins.  In 1690, Giovanni Cassini was the first to discover the differential rotation within Jupiter's atmosphere. What I don't know though is whether that was exactly translated to: 'Jupiter must be a gaseous or gaseous-like body.'

66187	0	a	For a bit of background, you can trivially calculate (to a high degree of  accuracy) the mass of anything that has an object orbiting it. That's the main way of calculating the mass of things in space.  That's why the error margins for the masses of asteroids and comets are so much higher than for planets, with planets we nearly directly measure the mass, with those other objects we look at the size, make a huge guess about what it may be made of from how shiny it is and where it is, and then go from there.

They're too floppy to walk in earth's gravity, so they blasted entire factories out of a giant gun pointed at earth, so within a few days of the factories crashing to the surface, they could build a small army of mechanical walkers to compensate for the gravity. H. G. Wells even invented the idea of the heat ray, and it doesn't make any fancy lights or sounds like Star Trek phasers, it just makes the air in its line of sight hot enough to combust whatever it's pointed at. And the accounts he gives of trying to fight off the aliens with 19th century weapons are awesome. War of the Worlds is some good-ass hard scifi.
66195	0	a	Wells‘ Martians were actually unique at the time for being non-humanoid (which makes them a lot more plausible), but he was criticized a lot because back then most people assumed intelligent aliens had to look humanoid because they thought that‘s the only shape possible for an intelligent creature.

66200	0	a	I was curious what that distance would be for a certain orbital alignment.   Mars  Venus  Sun  Earth  Venus is 108m kilometers from the sun, Earth is 150m km from the sun, Mars is 228m km from the sun.   So when Venus is on opposite side of the sun from earth, it's 258m km away from earth. If mars is on the same side of the sun as Venus then it would be 120m km away from Venus which would make Venus the closest planet to Mars.  
66201	0	a	Inclination not included, no.  Even if Mars and Jupiter were in perfect alignment with the sun, and the Earth was exactly opposite 180 degrees their position on the opposing side of the sun, Earth would  still be around 32% closer to Mars than Jupiter.    Space is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist’s, but that’s just peanuts to space.

Jupiter should have a composition similar to the nebula that formed our solar system, and heavier elements should be fairly rare, but they'll be there.  The thing is this. We don't know if the core of Jupiter is a heavy metal lump under all this massive pressure or if it's just a mix of all the elements and is undergoing convection, in which case the the heavy elements will be very dispersed.  Even if all the heavy elements are concentrated in a core, they are extremely hot, and the boundary between super dense metallic hydrogen and the core wouldn't be so defined you could say it had a surface.  Also, on an interesting side note, it's been theorized that the pressure would cause carbon in the atmosphere to crystallize and form a diamond ""rain"", where denser diamond would slowly move down to the core."

66210	0	a	It is pretty much impossible to melt wood. The reason is that as you start heading the wood up, its constituent building blocks tend to break up before the material can melt. This behavior is due to the fact that wood is made up of a strong network of cellulose fibers connected by a lignin mesh. You would need to add *a lot* of energy to allow the cellulose fibers to be able to easily slide past each other in order to create a molten state. On the other hand, there are plenty of other reactions that can kick in first as you transfer heat to the material.  If you have oxygen around you one key reactions is of course combustion. But even in the absence of oxygen there are plenty of reactions that will break up the material at the molecular level. The umbrella term for all of these messy reactions driven by heat is called [pyrolysis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis)  **Reference:**  1. Schroeter, J., et al. Melting Cellulose. *Cellulose* 2005: 12, pg 159-165. ([link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10570-004-0344-3))

66212	0	a	"No. In fact the process you are describing is exactly [how you make charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal).  ""Charcoal is usually produced by slow [pyrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis) — the heating of wood or other substances in the absence of oxygen""  Water and other volatile organic compounds (such as methanol) are basically boiled off and what remains is a large lump of carbon- a.k.a charcoal.  Can you melt carbon? No- not at [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon#Characteristics)  ""At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2 MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330 °C or 7,820 °F), so it sublimes at about 3,900 K."""
66213	0	a	You can heat the wood enough to soften the lignin and then bend it.  This is maybe the closest you can get to anything similar to melting it.  Once it cools, it will stay as it was bent, this is how acoustic guitar makers bend the sides of a guitar.  It's a common technique in making furniture as well. 
66214	0	a	Isn't heating wood in a low-oxygen environment how charcoal is made?

66219	0	a	Technically it's what goes on inside every solid-fuel flame.   Gas isn't dense enough to create the kind of light you see from a campfire.  What's happening is that the visible flame is the area where all the oxygen is gone.   The heat pyrolyses the fuel,  vaporizing it. But with no oxygen it can't burn. The fuel floats up through the flame to the edge where there is oxygen available.   Once at the edge it can burn,  and does so, releasing heat.  This heats up the vapor still in the flame making it hot enough to visibly glow in the visible spectrum.   Hence, visible flames.  Ie campfire flames aren't showing you combustion.   They're areas of glowing fuel vapor stuck in an oxygen-less bubble.  When they reach the edge of that bubble they burn, vaporizing and heating more fuel, and eating up oxygen so the inner bubble stays O2-free.  The combustion is on the tips of the flames. The flames are just fuel lines.

It included a lot of heat transfer, coupled with reactor design and process control. The idea was to use hot gasses to heat up the reaction chamber, so I tried to estimate the rate of pyrolysis at different temperatures using data I could find on the subject, do the heat transfer calculations, and optimize the design. The sawdust would be entering the reactor at one end, with a ball mill inside the reactor spinning, a nitrogen purge preventing oxidation, and hot gasses circulating around the chamber to control the temperature.  The product would be carbon black powder.

66227	0	a	"Its not actually circulation of BLOOD (if it was, those limbs or body parts would die off)  , its nerves being compressed and cut off . When ever you sit in a position or are in a position for a while that can COMPRESS nerves, they will stop transmitting. The nerve cells themselves will TRY to transmit at first, but when they don't receive feedback, they stop. This is the ""numbness"" or ""this body part fell asleep"" that we all experience. When the compression ends, the nerves can sense this and all at once begin a chain of ""testing"" aka sending out signals to all cells affected down the line, to make sure they are still there. Its like the electrical grid firing back up. It feels painful because our nerves use pain a response. The sensory organs in our brain after about 30 seconds to 120 seconds will shut this test firing pattern off and resume normal operations. But that time in between is pretty painful. It feels like Pins and needles because each sensation is a nerve "" thread ending "" being tested.

66228	0	a	"Hey! This was actually one of the first /askscience questions I answered. Copy of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/30d61w/when_a_part_of_your_body_falls_asleep_can_it/cprhn58/?st=jjt35mqo&sh=a680b675) below. ***** The tingly feeling is usually related more to nerve impingement/entrapment. It's actually pretty hard to completely cut off blood flow to your limbs by compressing/ligating vulnerable vessels. Using the arm as an example, here is the [blood supply](http://imgur.com/CMtLdm4), and the [nerve supply](http://imgur.com/CgykZRR) to the upper limb. (Source: Netter's *Atlas of Human Anatomy*). In the first image, note all the vessels that branch off of the subclavian, sections labelled 1 & 2. The vessels that wrap around the back of the scapula (shoulder blade) and connect with the others around the glenohumeral joint (where the ball of the humerus meets the socket of the shoulder blade) provides *collateral circulation* even if the subclavian/brachial artery is pinched shut in the axilla (armpit), the most vulnerable point.  Now look at the nerves. With the exception of the musculocutaneous nerve, all the nerves that innervate the upper limb pass through the 'pit' of the axilla that is vulnerable to compression (The MC nerve is also vulnerable, just less so).  The same applies to compression at other vulnerable points, there's almost always better collateral blood supply than there is innervation, since taking out nerve supply upstream cuts off the downstream more effectively than with blood flow.  ****  I was a a second (or 1st?) year med student at the time so I'll expand a little - I focused on macro scale blood flow in that answer & waved the rest away as ""nerve compression"", but what actually happens with nerve compression? It's likely related to ischemia/impaired flow, but at the *microvascular* level supplying the nerve. The nerves have tiny blood vessels (vasa ~~vasorum~~ *nervorum*) that supply them, and compressing the nerve will compress these and can compromise the blood supply to the nerve.  [This abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10679707/) has a decent overview, relevant part quoted below:  >while the membrane depolarization produced by ischemia affects both transient and persistent Na(+) channels. Postischemic and posttetanic paresthesias occur when hyperpolarization by the Na(+)/K(+) pump is transiently prevented by raised extracellular K(+). The electrochemical gradient for K(+) is reversed, and inward K(+) currents trigger regenerative depolarization. These mechanisms of paresthesia generation can account for paresthesias in normal subjects and may be relevant in some peripheral nerve disorders.  The gist of which is that 1) cuteneous & superficial sensory nerves are more likely to have ""false"" firing (see section above where I quoted) not related to actual stimuli; 2) ischemia (lack of blood flow) causes tissue pH to lower, this is balanced by exchange of Hydrogen ions outside cells for potassium ions inside such that Potassium in the fluid is higher. Then when this hits a tipping point, potassium flows back into the cells - including the nerve. This triggers depolarization (aka firing) of the nerve.  Typing this out between patients, please let me know if you have any questions or want more explanation of something! Hope this answered your question.  Edit: vasa nervorum, not vasa vasorum"

66231	0	a	I recall reading an analysis of this phenomenon many years ago in scientific american. The shower head does generate airflow, but also in a hot shower the warm air goes out over the top, sucking in cold air at floor level, causing the curtain to blow in.   I tried to find it again, but failed. Instead, [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/) is a modern equivalent analysis of the airflow using a finite element simulation - it seems comprehensive enough. 
66232	0	a	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower-curtain_effect  Hopefully Wikipedia is an allowed source (I'm too lazy to check the sidebar on mobile) but it's not necessarily a determined cause yet.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/  This article though does provide one likely cause, backed up by fluid simulations and a pretty graphic.  Basically the flow of water forms a vortex of low pressure that sucks the curtain in.
66233	0	a	Hot water heats the air in the shower, it rises over the top of the curtain. Cold air comes in from below and pushes the curtain in to replace it. Everyone has told you this already, but no one said to leave a small gap between the curtain and the wall to allow the cold air in. This will prevent the phenomenon from happening. 
66234	0	a	As people have pointed out it's a combination of the [Bernoulli effect and (when available) thermal dynamics](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kybBoxBAOkE/U18FXdCTlJI/AAAAAAAABV0/p1y6rQr24hs/s1600/the+shower+curtain+effect+explained.jpg) of air being warmed by the shower droplets. But the reason for my comment is your second point: *how to prevent it*.  One thing is to get weights or in the case of a metallic bathtub magnets and place them on the sides of the tub with the curtain between the surface and the magnet. This will reduce the effect, especially if you can get them at both corners and the middle rim of the tub as well.  Some shower curtains have these weights/magnets [built in](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CkxSQJRO1AY/U7qDB9CTG7I/AAAAAAAABnU/sm6bhCGZVZ8/s1600/magnetic+shower+curtain+has+magnets+embedded.jpg), while others have [suction cups](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9cfUx4t_Zt4/VLHE4bXr3wI/AAAAAAAACJI/Y8GTzf0naAU/s1600/heavy-weights-for-shower-curtain-bottom.jpg) at the bottom. Alternatively you can also buy kits that allow you alter your current curtain with [hook and latch](https://ourhumbleabodeblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/master-bathroom-shower-curtain-hooks.jpg?w=399&h=600) anchors.
66235	0	a	This is the most correct answer. I don't know what the hell everyone else is on about. The hot water rapidly warms the air around it, causing the air to movie upward and out of the shower space. Colder air then rushes in, pushing the curtain with it.
66236	0	a	[Here you go](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/). Stole if from the [Wikipedia article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower-curtain_effect), which was posted by u/jamincan [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6cmj7m/why_does_my_shower_curtain_seem_to_gravitate/dhvwigp/). 
66237	0	a	There is also the Bernoulli principle and airflow induction. Essentially, any quickly moving fluid will pull other fluids along with it via induction. In a shower, the primary fluid is water and the secondary fluid is air inside the shower, which convects around the flow of the spray. This causes a situation where the air inside the shower is moving faster than the air outside and here the Bernoulli principle takes hold: faster moving air has a lower relative air pressure. Suddenly, the higher air pressure outside is pushing the curtain in, similar to the way the higher pressure of slower air under a wing pushes it up.  This compounds the effect of the hot air rising out the top of the curtain and creating a chimney effect in the shower.  To see a simple demonstration of this effect, just get a drinking straw and a strip of paper. Hold the paper vertically in one hand and blow air on one side, and watch as the paper shifts towards the stream of air!
66238	0	a	So like, on each side of the curtain?  Genious, I'll try that tomorrow morning.  There's nothing worse than a wet shower curtain hitting certain body parts! *shrugs*
66239	0	a	I don't know, but [the article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/) he mentions is about how this hot water theory is wrong, as the effect also happens with cold water. So maybe that's what they're on about?
66240	0	a	As someone who *hates* feeling the cold air from opening the shower curtain, I just hold down either side of the curtain with shampoo bottles and it usually stays in place.
66241	0	a	Okay, someone want to try this with cold water?  The hot rising air theory send solid to me- I moved the top of the curtain to within an inch of the ceiling so that the hot air would have a harder time escaping, and that helped.
66242	0	a	Yeah, sometimes I'll slightly open the curtain side that's farthest away from the showerhead to allow airflow and that seems to help too. 
66243	0	a	It's also important to remember body temperature and the heat capacity of water, in addition to how we perceive temperature. Water that feels cold may still be higher than the air temperature, and drive the change mentioned in the parent comment; albeit at a slower rate.  Body temperature is generally warmer than ambient, which is part of the reason why solids (metal utensils, glasses, water, etc, which rest at or around the ambient/air temp) feel cold when you pick them up. These materials transfer more heat from the body, and this change over time is what our bodies detect.   Much the same reason why a 20°(68°F) day is a bit brisk, while a pool of the same temperature feels much colder. It's pulling more heat out of the body than air does, but they're both the same difference from 37° (98.6°F) body temperature.  ^(Edit: added alternate units)
66244	0	a	Fie! Hiss! Get out of here with your fancy double curtains! Not everyone can afford this kind of decadence! 
66245	0	a	Acid rain was caused by SO2 emissions from coal plants, **which have been cut by >90% since 1990**.   The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments kicked off a cap-and-trade scheme that incentivized coal plants to install scrubbers and/or switch to low-sulfur coal, then low-cost natural gas took ~50% of coal's market share since 2008.  Bottom line: coal is somewhat cleaner than it used to be, and we're burning far less of it.  [SOURCE](https://www3.epa.gov/airmarkets/progress/reports/index.html)
66246	0	a	The reduction in the prevalence of acid rain in the US is largely been attributed to the success of the EPAs Acid Rain Program.  All rain is somewhat acidic from rainwater forming carbonic acid from rainwater reacting with carbon dioxide, but acid rain is particularly lower in pH. This is due to the reaction of rainwater with nitrogen and sulfur oxides to form the much stronger nitric and sulfuric acids, respectively. The primary source of these nitrogen and sulfur oxides is power plant emissions, particularly those burning coal. The Ohio River Valley contains a large concentration of these power plants, and acid rain issues in the US were largely concentrated around this region and points downwind (the Atlantic Coast).  The Acid Rain Program was begun in 1990 based under the Clean Air Act. It established a market-based (cap and trade) system of regulation upon which emitters of sulfur and nitrogen oxides were granted pollution allowances. Polluters were incentivized to voluntary undertake measures to reduce the volume of their emissions as they could sell unused allowances for profit.  By most estimates, the Acid Rain Program has been largely successful. The Pacific Research Institute has estimated that this program has reduced total acid rain levels by 65% from 1976 levels while the EPA estimates the program cost businesses only a quarter of what was originally estimated. Savings in property damage and human health costs, such as lowered incidences of heart and lung problems exacerbated by acid rain, most likely have resulted in the Acid Rain Program actually saving money, overall.
66247	0	a	It is still there, albeit most data shows a decline in the prevalence due to consistent progress in reducing emissions.  The pH ~~acidity~~ of rain is decreased (made more acidic) primarily through the action of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  One of the biggest changes has been the result of a significant decrease in sulfur dioxide generation by China.  Parts of the US has seen some change, however other regions showed almost no improvement, if any at all regarding the pH of its rainwater in this timeframe.  The other aspect of this is that acid rain isn't nearly as harmful as people thought it was in the 90's, at least in terms of the public perception.  Acid rain is typically in the 5.0-5.5 pH range, with parts of the US seeing as low as 4.5 pH.  On one hand, when compared to something like a can of Coca-Cola which has a pH of ~2.3 this seems like it is nothing, but on the other hand, the effects of acid rain cover such a large surface area that it is not appropriate to compare it simply in terms of acidity.  There is a little bit of controversy as to just how harmful acid rain actually is, but most experts agree the most affected part of the environment are the various bodies of water, which are more susceptible to pH changes.  The amount and acidity of acid rain isn't enough to kill off wildlife outright in most cases, however it does cause the water to leech aluminum from the soil.   Most of this information is pop science that is easily searchable.  I do not mean this in a pedantic tone, but rather as encouragement for others to search for themselves because it is a topic that has a lot of data but also quite a bit of emotions and opinions that are not based on facts.  Edit: pH not acidity in the second sentence.  Very few things increase when it also decreases :D
66248	0	a	I wish they would highlight victories like this more often.  Environmentalism usually feels like a bunch of looming catastrophes that never end up really being anything.  The fact that the reason they don't end up being catastrophes is that we take action to stop them is completely lost on the average person like myself, so that the original hype ends up looking like some chicken-little sky-is-falling shit, and we aren't even told that the sky WAS falling and we legislated against that.

Also heard, there was significant cost-benefit analysis done with regards to the coatings required for automobiles due to future acid rain damage.  I think the costs to society to reduce high sulfur emissions was far lower than the incremental automobile costs.

66253	0	a	"That was because the mechanism was ""market based"", aka a ""cap-n-trade"" program. Other environmental groups (and the Democrats) favored a tougher regulatory approach (basically mandating use of filters and hard restrictions on emissions).   Back then no one really argued over the science (Sulfur emissions cause acid rain) so the debate was just how to combat it, with Republicans favoring market mechanisms and Democrats favoring traditional regulation. Now of course that is changed."

An administratively determined cap would be an enormous target for political lobbying, with annual battles pitting utilities against environmental NGOs.  Can you imagine the wangling when a cold December causes utilities to hit the cap prior to the end of the year?  A much better option for unavoidable but undesirable emissions is a ""Pigovian"" tax, in this case a tax per ton of emitted CO2.  It applies leverage against emitters but without the wild market gyrations caused by a hard cap."

66261	0	a	Yes, very slowly.  Light has momentum, even though it is massless, so if you shoot a beam of light in one direction, conservation of momentum will push you in the opposite direction.  A reasonably powerful LED flashlight will use about 1-3 Watt, lets say 3 W. The efficiency of a LED is somewhere between 25% and 40%, so for sake of ease of computation lets make that 33% and we get a net amount of light output of 1 W.   The ratio between the momentum and energy of light is 299,792,458 (Which is also the speed of light). So in 1 second, the flashlight produces 1 J worth of light, which is equal to 0.33 * 10^-8 kg m/s. If the flashlight is not too heavy, say 100 gram or 0.1 kg, that means that 1 second of light would propel the flashlight to a velocity of 10^-7 m/s. This assumes that all light is directed in straight line. The more cone-shaped the bundle of light is, the lower the momentum transfer is.  Leaving the light on for one day would propel the flashlight to about 0.009 m/s or almost 1 cm per second. Unfortunately, operating a 3 W LED for a day uses about 260 kJ of energy. Regular AA batteries have somewhere around 10 kJ of energy (depending on the type). And at a weight of 20-30 grams per battery, you can't carry put more than 2-3 in the device without violating our original assumption of a 100 gram device.
66262	0	a	As an addendum to the information already provided here:  Its not just visible light that'll produce a tangible thrust.  Any wavelength of light will.   This becomes a problem for space probes, because electronics and power supplies turning on and off create heat in the infrared spectrum, and these infrared photons cause a small thrust which over long periods of time will cause the probe to veer off course.  There's actual computer simulation and modeling done at NASA to account for this infrared-thrust effect when setting probe trajectories and course corrections.
66263	0	a	As other answers have said, Yes.  In terms of using this as actual spaceship propulsion (powered by solar panels), there is a slightly easier way:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail  Which reflects the sun's light to generate (tiny amounts of) thrust!

That... that's actually way way way faster than I would have expected, even acknowledging the lack of batteries that would provide the necessary energy at the required weight. Awesome calculation... thanks!  Suppose we were to create the usually-a-joke ""solar powered flashlight"" and keep it in that weight profile. I'm not sure of the efficiency of our best solar cells currently, and I'm not sure it would be sufficient to generate 3W even if all the battery weight was replaced with a solar system, but at whatever trickle it gave, would that provide a basically unlimited (albeit ridiculously low power) propulsion system? Does the acceleration continue to build up over time (1cm/s day 1, 2cm/s day 2, etc) or would it hit an exceedingly low maximum speed in relatively short order (ignoring the effects of gravity and such). I'm having amusing visions of a tiny flashlight puttering off through deep space for all eternity.   Edits for grammar."
66265	0	a	It's incredible how many different factors they have to consider when doing these calculations... o.o
66266	0	a	"What you're suggesting is an inefficient approach to building a ""solar sail"". Instead of catching the sunlight with a solar panel, converting it to electricity and then using said electricity to power a flashlight, with losses at every step along the way, you can simply take a large reflective surface and let the sunlight bounce off it.  The incoming sunlight has some momentum and when reflected completely, the outgoing light has equal and opposite momentum, which means that the net gain in momentum by the spacecraft is twice the momentum of the incoming light. By changing the angle of the reflective surface with respect to the incoming sunlight, you can steer the craft.  You'll only ever be able to move away from the sun in this way, not closer. But the same is true if you would capture the light with solar cells and use it to power a flashlight (which can shine in arbitrary direction), since capturing the light with a solar panel also causes a momentum transfer from the sunlight to the craft."
66267	0	a	Only in classic Newtonian physics. When nearing c and mass nearing zero, you get relativistic momentum.  E^2 = (p \* c)^2 + ( m_0 \* c^2 )^2  In low speeds, the equations align.
66268	0	a	Yeah, it gives me a headache trying to account for everything that could affect a spaceship's journey from one point to another. I think the scientists got most of that information down in the initial testing period. I guess it helps that they had a whole agency of bright people on it. 
66269	0	a	Assuming the craft is in a heliocentric orbit, couldn't the sail be angled to reduce the orbital velocity, and then perhaps folded up while the craft coasts to its new (lower) perihelion?
66270	0	a	I've always been so curious about how huge intellectually intense projects like space exploration or physics experiments are managed. Does the smartest one oversee the project and instruct other still very smart people to focus on different tasks? One guy takes care of fuel, another takes care of HOW much fuel, the other takes care of the gas can.
66271	0	a	Yes, I didn't really consider orbits (and gravity) in my original comment. Obviously the story becomes more complicated if you do.
66272	0	a	It's not necessarily the smartest one who manages the others.  At that level, everyone involved is smart.  Scientists and engineers end up specializing in different things as their careers progress.  Some will specialize in fuel, for instance.  Another in fuel pumps, perhaps.  Others will end up specializing in managing projects like what you're talking about.  So when NASA or someone wants to do a project, they start by hiring a scientist who is very good at managing projects, and then he goes out and hires other scientists of other specialties depending on what the project is.    Source: I'm a scientist (engineer) who manages projects of hundreds or sometimes even thousands of other scientists, engineers, and technicians.
66273	0	a	> Obviously the story becomes more complicated if you do.  But not as complicated as trying to fly a solar sailed, well anything, without thinking in terms of orbit and just trying to fly it around in straight lines
66274	0	a	The light loses energy when it is reflected. So the wavelength will slightly increase with each bounce.  EDIT: There are a lot of replies to OP which are incorrect. Even with a 100% efficient set of mirrors (with no heat loss), even if you somehow got the bounces to perfectly reflect back and forth, there is an *inherent loss of energy* in the photons when they change momentum by bouncing off the mirror. 
66275	0	a	Then you're imagining too small a sail!  Solar sailed space ships in scifi are often coke-can sized computers connected via nano-filaments to many square kilometers of nanometer thin sails.   Once you're kinda far away from your star, it might be worth investing in a big, space station based laser and keep firing it at the sail 24/7.
66276	0	a	Now I'm imagining people at a port blowing at the sails on a ship.  It's interesting how some apparently meaningless things work, when scaled up.
66277	0	a	"There are number systems which do just as you describe. Here are two (I don't know of others) such examples of this:  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere  The latter is the extension by defining z/0 in the complex plane.  A lot of the math rules are the same as you're used to, but there are important differences. For example in the projectively extended reals statements such as  * a > b  * a set of all numbers between -4 and 7 is [-4...-1...0...7]  are no longer meaningful without extra context. I can always pass through infinity to just as easily write  * a < b  * a set of all numbers between -4 and 7 is [-4...-10...infinity...7]  With some added assumptions of what ""a"" and ""b"" are and where infinity is on your interval if it's included, you can restore the idea of order and intervals."
66278	0	a	There are many good answers already, but I think there's a simpler one that has to do with inverses.  An inverse is a sort of mathematical undo, it reverses the action of some function.  Instead of thinking of division and subtraction as operations, think of them as inverse multiplication and addition.  When you see `5 + x = 7` we can solve this using an inverse: `x = 5 + x + (-5) = 7 + (-5) = 2`. We can construct the integers from the naturals by *closing* the addition operation through the extension of negative numbers.  When we try the same thing with multiplication, we get the rational numbers. Given `x * 3 = 6` we can use the multiplicative inverse of 3, one third, to solve the equation: `x * 3 * (1/3) = x = 6 * (1/3) = 2`.  We cannot actually close the rationals under multiplication, because of zero. The closest thing to do is take the set of rational numbers except for zero and treat this as a multiplicative group.  Since zero times anything is zero, we have `0*x = 0`. Since `x = 5` is just as valid a solution as `x = -1`. Since no unique solution for `x` gets determined by the equation, there's no way to assign a consistent value to the multiplicative inverse of zero.  TL;DR: zero times anything is zero, so it's impossible to undo that multiplication and figure out what you started with.
66279	0	a	When you define i such as i²=-1, you can just use it the same way as any real constant, and keep doing math.  If you define a constant to be equal to 1/0 and try to keep doing math with it, you will find contradictions at every corner. First quick example to come in mind: if we call it b (why not), then 1/b is, obviously 0, but what is 1/(b+1)? If it is zero, then b+1=b so 1=0. If it is not, then you just found a finite value for b.
66280	0	a	"The problem is that x*0=0 for all x so if you invert multiplication then x=0/0 also for all x. This contains no information. If you allow this you can ""prove"" things like 1=2 (All those wrong proofs contain a hidden division by zero)"
66281	0	a	Another system that works out just fine is what comes out of [Graphical Linear Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/). There, if you try to divide by zero, you end up with another object, which is labeled ∞. But then as it turns out there are two other “infinities” that show up if you play around with 0 and ∞, which show a bunch of curious rules. Among other things it turns out that 0\*∞ ≠ ∞\*0, which is kinda weird. Since that is true for all other numbers, you lose some important structure. There’s also no natural way to order these new numbers, so 1<∞ isn’t true or false but just senseless.
66282	0	a	There's a structure called a wheel that I *very* briefly studied, which also defines 0/0 (but then you lose even more of the rules you're used to): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory  I remember talking about the wheel of fractions in particular, where things like this happen:  * 0 * 1/0 = 0/0, so you can't always say 0x = 0 or x/x = 1 * 1/0 - 1/0 = 0/0, so you can't always say x - x = 0
66283	0	a	By the way, the projective *plane* (extended Euclidean plane) is a very important part of the Elliptic Curve group theory, which you're probably using at this moment while browsing reddit. HTTPS/SSL/TLS rely on cryptography to communicate securely with the server, and some of it may use Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.
66284	0	a	Yeah this.  If you have division by 0 you can't have a field, so the things that do have division by 0 can't be algebraic, and end up being more geometric things where you aren't usually dividing and multiplying anyway.
66285	0	a	This is the best answer. If there was a use to define a division by 0 in some useful way, we would have done so.
66286	0	a	Wow thats super interesting.
66287	0	a	That isn't what is meant by inverse in this situation. The operations `plus(1,5)` and `plus(2,4)` both produce the result `6`. You also can't *undo* the number 6 to deduce definitively which input values were added to produce that result; that isn't what is being discussed here.  The quality of the inverse operation discussed here refers to the fact that applying the inverse function to an  output of the original function and the second operand of the original function produces one unique result \- the first operand. Specifically, `minus(plus(a,b),b) = a` and `divide(multiply(a,b),b)=a` are both almost always valid statements, except for specific degenerative cases. For this discussion, `inverse(operation(a,b),b)=a` .

66289	0	a	If you want to know the details, I encourage you to read on the linked blog. The first few lessons are extremely accessible, then it gets a bit more complex as he goes on to prove all the claims he made actually hold, and then it gets more accessible again. The relevant lesson is [26. Keep Calm and Divide by Zero](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/12/14/26-keep-calm-and-divide-by-zero/), to understand it you’ll definitely need to read the first bunch, maybe up to number 9, which are all pretty light and introduce the whole notation of GLA (after that the proofs start). You’ll need to figure out some other things from the later lessons, too, but it should be pretty intuitive then, just don’t let the fancy words scare you.
66290	0	a	The commutative property is hugely important to abstract algebra for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is in finding important substructure of groups, etc. 
66291	0	a	Yeah “useful” there was misguided. If we could find a way to define it that was both *consistent* with existing theory and *free from contradiction* we would have done so.
66292	0	a	Yes! There's a lot of research going into tinnitus. The DOD funds a good portion of it (turns out loud explosions and artillery are destroying the hearing of our active troops and vets.)  I'm sure there are many groups working on this, but I know the Tzounopoulos group at the University of Pittsburgh is actively working on a drug to cure/prevent tinnitus. Not my area of expertise so I don't know the specifics of the project, but here is a link to his website. Some of his papers may be interesting to OP and anyone else looking for info.     http://phrc.pitt.edu/people/thanos-tzounopoulos
66293	0	a	Tinnitus is often associated with noise-induced hearing loss, which is in turn caused by damage and death of hair cells in the cochlea. These cells are responsible for sensing vibrations and translating them to nerve signals to be sent to the brain. Once damaged or destroyed they cannot regenerate naturally. However several methods of inducing hair cell regeneration are currently under investigation, see [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534485/).  EDIT: As you can tell from my flair I am not an expert on this topic and I've only done some cursory reading because I have mild tinnitus myself, I won't be able to answer any questions that I'm not familiar with.
66294	0	a	I am not a doctor or scientist but have done extensive research, participated in Tinnitus groups, and had multiple well educated Audiologists and Otolaryngologists and was very fortunate to have them. These were people who attended conferences and were always staying ahead of the curve in understanding the research and trials available, in the pipeline, and being discussed.  Many doctors have also said the same thing and it seems to be consensus - without having tinnitus it is difficult to assess from the outside, and there have been many audiologists I have seen in other cities who I have had the opportunity to educate based on my experience. There is a limited number of people worldwide who are truly invested in this condition.  ​  **What is it?**  Tinnitus (tin-ih-tus) is a catchall used to describe hearing noise when there is no external source present. Common understanding always brings this discussion to two of the most basic causes - trauma or long term degradation.  Trauma can be a single external event, such as a gun firing, explosion, a crash, but could even be smaller things too. There is some consensus (but it is not a silver bullet) that a shot of prednisone into the ear OR a regimen of oral prednisone taken within 48 hours (24 hours or earlier preferably) can limit the damage of a severe auditory trauma.  Long term degradation is similar to trauma, but is the result of noises less than severe auditory trauma over the course of a lifetime.  ​  These are the best understood because they affect the most people - those who have had military service, and the elderly. These cases affect the vast majority of tinnitus users, but the severity of the tinnitus in a good portion of these is manageable and most likely monotone in nature. The movies you may have seen depict this kind of tinnitus very well, and you may have even experienced it yourself after a night out at a concert, bar etc only for it to slowly die down over the next few days.  ​  As others here have stated, there is work here that focuses on the idea that hair cell regeneration may be a positive factor in repairing the damage.  \---------  **What is it** ***really?***  Now to the more extensive understanding. Tinnitus is really a neurological issue, despite the cause. I know many are hopeful for the ear hair cell regeneration but this is not as promising to tinnitus in general as it seems.  ​  There are many other causes for Tinnitus - a side effect of medication, infection (not just ear, but viral infections in the brain), acoustic neuroma, Meniere's disease, blood vessel issues, muscular issues, TMJ, and others!  Due to tinnitus having many causes there are some treatments which affect others and which do not work for most. There is even a type of tinnitus which is objective and the doctor could actually hear the noise, this is from blood vessels and is called pulsating tinnitus.  ​  Since tinnitus is so broad and there are many underlying factors, it is incredibly difficult to 'cure' as you would only be treating some specific types of tinnitus. The type of noise people hear, the frequency, severity, number of tones/pitches, the nature of the noise, etc are all very very different although the name tinnitus is used to describe all of these. This means that it is very hard to create an accurate sample of people to run tests on, as the description and type of tinnitus may be very unique for people, and is also dependent on subjective evaluation by the subjects themselves.  The nature of tinnitus is normally that it is not constant on every day and can change in severity, volume, frequency etc on a daily or hourly basis. Tracking progress on treatment can be hard due to this, and there are a lot of factors that *could* impact tinnitus such as stress (#1), diet, sleep, external factors like noise, and others.  ​  **The good news**  The good news is there are promising steps being made to treat the neurological causes and factors of tinnitus. To understand research both past and present, a tremendous resource is [https://www.tinnitustalk.com/forums/research-news.4/](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/forums/research-news.4/) which is a collection of tinnitus sufferers who have had it for years or decades and stay very active in the community and do a ton of research as well as share experiences if they participate in trials.  ​  There have been many medications developed, all of which have failed at the second trial round usually, which attempt to address potassium channels that can lead to the reduction or elimination of tinnitus. There is some promise here but the majority of these medications treat another primary cause like seizures and the added effect on tinnitus is secondary which makes trials for those with tinnitus ineligible. There have also been many trials with different medications which you can clearly see on that TinnitusTalk research board.  ​  Other attempts at solutions have involved treatments to the brain with magnetic or electrical stimulation to address the neuroplasticity of the brain. Many of these are new and again will never be a silver bullet but could be a general use to assist those who are eligible due to the potential for reduction or elimination. rTMS or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was a hot button for a while, and there are other treatments that are always in the pipeline but require much time and are essentially unattainable for the near future.  ​  **The even better news**  ​  Research here is growing exponentially, and we understand more every day.  ​  **The bad news**  There is a massive lack of funding for research here though and also a very low potential for ROI for pharmaceutical companies due to potential medications not having enough people that the cost of research and manufacturing would far outweigh those who could be positively affected and need prescriptions. A good few promising companies have gone under and hold on to all their research and it has not been shared with the scientific community, halting a lot of progress in a potential search for treatment.  ​  **Resources**  ​  If you're interested, [tinnitustalk.com](https://tinnitustalk.com) is a fantastic resource which contains a lot of very knowledgeable individuals. Be careful as there are tons of differing opinions and take no one person's words as fact, **INCLUDING MINE!** Also, us tinnitians (as a lovely facebook group member called us) can be a very very angry bunch due to living in eternal hell day in and day out so there is some petty bickering that happens here.  The American Tinnitus Association [www.ata.org](https://www.ata.org) is a GREAT resource, and **PLEASE if you are shopping Amazon for Christmas try using the Smile program to donate to them!** The British Tinnitus Association is also at the front of the global community too.  ​  ​  **TL;DR**  Nope we're in trouble. There are tons of programs in existence and being developed that work to manage tinnitus, but there is no 'cure' in sight, and there may never actually be one! Too many causes and difficulty in getting reliable data along with poor ROI for companies discourages research.
66295	0	a	Yes! Gene therapy is being worked on by multiple research firms across the globe. The most notable being Frequency Therapeutics who have a drug currently in phase 1/2 of testing. It's called FX-322 and it's an injection into the eardrum. It works by regenerating the hair cells responsible for the conditions in the first place. If things go well, the drug could possibly be 5-6 years away from release. Research for hearing loss and tinnitus has picked up a lot momentum in the past couple of years due to increased funding from multiple companies and governments. The reason that it is so late is because until now, the mechanisms behind the ear and the brain were not understood very well. Now that research has caught up, multiple solutions are being worked on. 
66296	0	a	See [Meniere's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re%27s_disease) for another example of tinnitus and hearing loss. Because of the Meniere's, my tinnitus is broadband noise, rather than a tone or ringing. It sounds similar to sticking one's head out the window of a fast moving car. And the vertigo is absolutely the worst thing I have ever experienced physically.  Several commenters below recommend seeing an ENT. Actually, you should seek out an Otolaryngologist. 
66297	0	a	I thought tinnitus was linked with brain function as opposed to hearing loss which is linked with cell death. 
66298	0	a	It is a disorder of the auditory system and the leading hypothesis is that the noise itself is generated in the central nervous system. However this is most often preceded by noise-induced hearing loss. The absence of input from the cochlea leads to abnormal activity in the auditory cortex, which produces the sensation of tinnitus. See [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3918281/) for some details.
66299	0	a	No they’re not. Auditory hair cells (stereocilia) are fingerling and taut(**) across two membranes (tectorial and basilar), like strings on a guitar. They pick up different frequencies depending on their size (there are a few different sizes of sterocilia) and how they vibrate related to what basal cells and receptors they are rooted to. Signals from these stereocilia are translated to the auditory cranial nerve.   Hearing loss occurs when these stereocilia are exposed to frequent loud noises or other disruptions to the inner ear. When these stereocilia cannot move properly, they cannot detect noise and send signals to the auditory nerve. Stem cell treatments are being researched to regenerate these sterocilia and their connections to the auditory nerve.  The hairs on your head are not living nor cells; they are made of keratin, a rigid protein used in the body for structure. They grow from projections evolutionarily related to plaques and scales on distant mammals. 
66300	0	a	...so it’s sorta like the body’s sound sensor is broken, and then the brain sees a floating value and interprets it as tinnitus?
66301	0	a	"Well the reason the temperature in the past was so much higher is that the high CO2 levels persisted for many thousands of years allowing for the progressive accumulation of water vapor in the atmosphere which accelerated the greenhouse effect. CO2 is actually the second most important greenhouse gas behind water vapor, though it is often the trigger for climatic change because it's concentration in the atmosphere is controlled by a variety of complex processes where as water vapor is effectively controlled by temperature and pressure. Over time the increased temperature has a positive feedback with water in the atmosphere allowing for very elevated temperatures. It's worth noting that when we say the ""the last time"" we are taking a snapshot of a world that had been experiencing those conditions for millenia.  We currently believe we can keep the warming around 2C because we are projecting mitigation and emission reduction strategies that will eventually slow the warming trend. In the short term (geologically speaking) that means a temperature rise of around 2C."
66302	0	a	I think a lot of the concern about methane stems from the potential positive feedback loop that exists in polar regions. There's a ton of methane locked up in the 10's of millions of square kilometres of polar permafrost regions, and if these regions melt under climate change this adds to methane emissions, which adds to GHG emissions, which leads to more warming, which leads to more permafrost melting, etc. 
66303	0	a	"The short answer is that we don't, at least not all of us.  I certainly don't. 2C is incredibly ambitious at this point, so I'm actually with you.    However, the reasoning behind it is that CO2 to temperature isn't as simple as a 1 to 1 relationship where a CO2 level of X leads to a temperature of Y.  There are many factors in play, of which CO2 is just one.  More of it will always lead to a temperature increase, but the end value depends on a lot more, stuff like how much ice exists near the poles, solar energy, all kinds of stuff.    So in a previous ""configuration"", this CO2 level will have led to warmer temperatures at times, and probably colder temperatures at times. But in this configuration, this is what we get at this level of CO2. "
66304	0	a	I've heard about the potency of methane as a GHG, but your post suggests it's not one of the 'top 2'. Where does methane fit into the ranking of most important GHGs?

I've heard climate scientists say that it is no longer a realistic target.
66306	0	a	Methane is a more efficient greenhouse gas than water and CO2 (because it has more vibrational modes, which are (kind of) a necessary condition for absorbing infrared radiation), but it's less abundant (parts per billion methane vs parts per million CO2 and a widely varying (but higher) number density for water).
66307	0	a	"> because it has more vibrational modes, which are (kind of) a necessary condition for absorbing infrared radiation  Could you expand on this a little more? I understand that having a vibrational mode of the right energy will allow a molecule to absorb infrared radiation and become excited, but the ""kind of"" implies there is more to the story."
66308	0	a	"multiphoton absorption can lead to all sorts of processes energetically, and you can change rotational energy with single infrared photons and electronic energy in certain molecules, but vibrational excitation is the ""typical"" way infrared photons are absorbed by greenhouse gases, I believe. The energy can also become kinetic, and the initial energy before absorption will change what is possible."

66310	0	a	Does anyone know - was there a time where the scientific community legitimately thought blood transfusion was impossible? I can't imagine it was easy figuring out blood type before certain technological advances.
66311	0	a	I have a couple retired racing greyhounds and have a couple fun facts for you. They are universal blood donors, and with few exceptions, blood from any greyhound can be given to any other breed of dog. They are also lean with big neck veins, thin skin, and very insensitive to pain. This combination is simply perfect for blood donation.
66312	0	a	I believe the first transfusion attempt that was recorded was a human receiving pig's blood, with now-predictable consequences.
66313	0	a	Greyhounds also have a higher PCV (packed cell volume) than other dogs. This means that their blood has more red blood cells by volume than blood from the average dog, making it great for transfusions. 
66314	0	a	Not to my knowledge. There are other proteins besides the A, B, AB, and rhesis factor.  Even in humans not every transfusion that's a match is equal.
66315	0	a	The first recorded SUCCESSFUL transfusion was between two dogs performed by Richard Lower in like 1660 or something. Then people started giving lamb's blood to people. That went poorly frequently, so it was outlawed. Then they tried again (years later with human to human transfusions) and it worked. People discovered blood types and bob's your uncle.   Fun fact: they also tried transfusing (infusing?) other shit too... like milk. That also went poorly, as you can imagine.

66319	0	a	"well.... yes and no... mostly no ;)  they did it back then because they thought that giving someone lamb's blood would make them calm, like a lamb. obviously that's wrong, for many reasons:   if you do give someone lamb's blood they will have a horrible ""acute hemolytic transfusion reaction."" where the recipient's existing antibodies immediately break apart (lyse) the lamb's blood. if untreated, these reactions can lead to serious complications, like kidney failure and death.   amazingly some people survived these transfusions, and in the immediate post-transfusion period they were calm ""like a lamb"" because they almost died and their bodies were barely holding onto dear life. but most people died... so they outlawed the practice.   edit: clarity "
66320	0	a	"Yes, Greyhounds require a different anesthesia protocol than other dogs due to this very reason. Source: former vet tech  edit for clarity: The reason being their high metabolism. When they said ""sleep for days"" they meant sleep forever. Certain barbituates can kill them. Instead of just inducing with propofol and keeping under with sevo, they require additional meds like acepromazole and atropine. My doc would pop em with ace and telazole, atropine,then keep them under with sevoflourane gas... you get the picture. Extra work and meds indeed, a few breeds required this protocol"
66321	0	a	How does it work for mixed breeds then? Like how would a vet determine which to use?
66322	0	a	I am a vet and I disagree with a little bit of this. Modern anesthetic protocols are generally very safe for sighthounds. It is usually they older heavy sedatives (i.e. acepromazine in fact! And domitor, and yes barbiturates) that they are more sensitive to and are more risky. The typical protocols recommended by most anesthesiologists, such as an opiate + benzodiazepine + propofol induction and maintenance on sevoflurane, is most ideal. It's the heavy sedation with minimal monitoring and attention to ventilation that is an issue for them.
66323	0	a	Usually the pre-op blood work would tell us what we needed to know, you can't beat hard evidence like that
66324	0	a	I have always been asked by my vet if I want to do blood work before any surgery. They always framed it as not super necessary but helpful... I'm glad I have always opted to do it now!
66325	0	a	Most vets offer it before any anaesthetic but it's up to the owner if they chose to go ahead. Many diseases are underlying, I.e they show no clinical signs. Pre-op blood work helps to identify contusions which would make anaesthesia life threatening. In young, apparently healthy dogs and cats, there are congenital conditions such as a hole in the heart, kidney dysplasia, liver shunts etc that wouldn't show up until the body is put under stress, such as anaesthesia.  For instance an apparently healthy dog might have a vein left over from when it was in the womb that bypasses the liver (a shunt), reducing oxygen supply to the organ. When anaesthetic drugs are given this puts an extra strain in the liver to break down the chemicals and it fails to compensate. This means the drugs stay in the system much longer than they should, or build to life-threatening levels. A simple test pre-anaesthesia will show the liver under strain, and more investigations can be performed to determine whether the dog is safe to undergo the procedure.

66351	0	a	“Niagara Falls” is actually three waterfalls, the “American”, the “Bridal veil”, and the “Horseshoe”  falls.  Never in recorded history have all three of them completely frozen, but the smaller two (American and Bridal Veil”) have frozen a few times.  When it happens, most of the water on the surfaces of Lake Erie and the Niagara river is already frozen so the volume of water going over the falls is reduced anyway. The rest of the moving water goes over the unfrozen parts of the Horseshoe falls.  Besides this, two big hydroelectric power plants, one American and one Canadian, divert water away from the falls to generate electricity.  This means the river and the falls have less water than they can handle anyway.    Source: grew up in the city of Niagara Falls.  This stuff is local legend and drilled into our heads as kids.  
66352	0	a	As mentioned in previous posts, much of the water gets diverted to hydro electric plants. In the summer, during the day, there is an agreement that states the water cannot he diverted as much. This is so that tourists can see the falls “in all their glory”. At nighttime and during the winter, much more is diverted for energy production.   As for your question. Historically speaking, ice bridges have formed, even to the point where people would play on the bridges, set up a market, and walk across to the other country’s side. This has been illegal since 1912, but even while this happened, water still flowed over the falls. Although the ice bridge was thick and sturdy, the fast flowing water runs beneath the ice, so it can look like the falls have frozen, but there is still water flowing over them, along and behind the ice. Think of it like an icy covering that’s hiding the real flow of water.   There is only one instance of the falls completely freezing over, about 150 years ago, however all the other water had completely frozen as well, so the side effects were minimal.   tl;dr If Niagara Falls ever did completely freeze over, the rest of Lake Erie probably did to, so there would be no concern for flooding or anything of the sort. 
66353	0	a	So not one has really answered the question asked.   What would happen if Niagra falls stopped flowing completly (let's also assume the other diversions like hydro-power don't exist.   Yes, the water would start to rise behind it however it's not going to be as dramatic as you think. The river is actually just an extension of Lake Erie. In effect, you would be increasing the volume of Lake Erie since the river level is also the lake level. Lake Erie has a natural fluctuation of about a foot and historically has fluctuated about three feet (different between the max lowest level and max highest level). I can't find data for the current level however the last couple years the level has been around the average which put's it about a foot below the historical maximum. This means that it could conceivably rise a foot without causing too much of a problem (possibly some local minor flooding).  Lake Erie has a surface area of 25 744 Km^2  To raise Lake Erie by 1 cm, you would need to add 2.57 x 10^11 L of water.   2.84 x 10^6 L of water flows over Horseshoe, the American Falls, and Bridal Veil falls per second.   This means that if you shut off the falls completely (again, not accounting for the hydro production), the water level of Lake Erie would rise by 1 cm every 25h or, about a foot a month.   All of this assumes that the volume of water flowing in to the lake remains constant. In reality, the water levels won't rise that fast since the inflow of water is also reduced for similar reasons (less water is flowing in the winter as it stays frozen on the ground). This is also a very simplistic view since it doesn't take in to account evaporation which also fluctuates depending on how frozen over the lake is.   As others have pointed out though, completely freezing over doesn't mean that water isn't flowing. It's just a reduction in flow. There is only one instance where the water completely stopped flowing which happened in ~~1948~~ 1848 as a result of an ice jam. This only lasted a couple hours though. The American Falls have previously been artificially shut off as well for maintenance (erosion prevention measures)  EDIT: As pointed out by /u/Cumberlandjed, the drop to the top of the rapids is 2.7m. I originally discounted the drop since I didn't think it would be that significant. As such, depending on where the blockage happened and the height of the banks, you might just end up with localized flooding which would eventually cause the stream to divert around the blockage and flow to the canyon through another route. If the banks are high enough to contain the river over the drop, my scenario would still hold. Essentially the river would increase to the lake level.  
66354	0	a	The falls are never truly frozen--as in frozen solid with no flow. Think about a river or lake that freezes over. The ice may be quite thick but there is still water underneath. The river is still flowing below that solid sheet of ice. So in the case of the falls, you may see ice, but there is still flow behind it. It is always flowing even in the coldest winters.
66355	0	a	Interestingly, there are actually regulations regarding the maximum amount of water that can be diverted from the falls. We are entirely capable of 'turning off' the Niagra falls completely. 
66356	0	a	So if the water was not diverted to generate electricity, would the falls be noticeably more vigorous?
66357	0	a	Another fact about Niagara, they've actually stopped the whole falls part to do some repairs or something. There's a picture of it online somewhere.
66358	0	a	Interestingly enough, they are planning on stopping the falls to do some improvements in early 2019 last I heard
66359	0	a	Yes, and there is actually a treaty between the US and Canada in which they agreed upon minimum levels of flow over the falls at various times: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/corporate/international-affairs/partnerships-countries-regions/north-america/canada-united-states-niagara-river-treaty.html
66360	0	a	I can only find images of the [stopped American Falls](https://i.imgur.com/WWcMxyv.jpg) (and maybe the Bridal Veil Falls) without water. Couldn't find any of the Horseshoe Falls (on the Canadian side). 
66361	0	a	My favorite part is that America and Canada have joint custody over one of the falls. And while I'm sure there's some treaty regarding shutting part of it off, I like the idea that if there's some feud one country could just turn their side off out of spite.

66366	0	a	On the US side, Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant has a 2,675 megawatt capacity. On the Canadian side, the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations can do 1,997 megawatts.  Depending on the standard you use, 750-1,200 houses are powered per megawatt. 4,672 megawatt total, so 4 million homes is a reasonable estimate.  Production is dependent on need. Midnight in winter needs less production than a 90 degree summer day, for instance. The actual production will always be well below maximum capacity. But, as long as water flows, they can put out the electricity. It's a continuous figure.   [If you're curious, it's easy to spot on Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.1461422,-79.043191,1630m/data=!3m1!1e3), they're basically across the river from each other, just north of the falls, and supplied by large reservoirs (fed from water up stream).
66367	0	a	You know hydro is part of the green energy movement right?
66368	0	a	Just as an interesting aside, in colder areas, electrical demand is at its highest in winter.  Here in Saskatchewan, our record electrical consumption days are always in the winter, because furnaces are running nearly 24/7, people have to plug in engine block heaters to be able to start their cars, etc.  We air condition some, but considerably less than hotter areas do, so demand is actually lower in summer than in winter.  Consumption is lowest of all in spring and autumn.

66372	0	a	whoa!   so basically the whole ice ageWas caused by the closing of the Panamanian isthmus?  http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/how-the-isthmus-of-panama-put-ice-in-the-arctic.  >The principal engine of this global circulation, often called the Ocean Conveyor, is the difference in salt content between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Before the Isthmus of Panama existed, Pacific surface waters flowed into the Atlantic. Their waters mixed, roughly balancing the two oceans’ salinity.  >About 5 million years ago, the North American, South American, and Caribbean Plates began to converge. The gradual shoaling of the Central American Seaway began to restrict the exchange of water between the Pacific and Atlantic, and their salinities diverged.  >Evaporation in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean left ocean waters there saltier and put fresh water vapor into the atmosphere. The Trade Winds carried the water vapor from east to west across the low-lying Isthmus of Panama and deposited fresh water in the Pacific through rainfall. As a result, the Pacific became relatively fresher, while salinity slowly and steadily increased in the Atlantic.  >As a result of the Seaway closure, the Gulf Stream intensified. It transported more warm, salty water masses to high northern latitudes, where Arctic winds cooled them until they became dense enough to sink to the ocean floor. The Ocean Conveyor was rolling, drawing even more Gulf Stream waters northward.  snip  >On their journey to the North Pacific, these deep waters became enriched in nutrients and carbon dioxide. In the Subarctic Pacific, these deep waters could have upwelled, rising to the sunlit surface to provide the ingredients to spark enormous blooms of phytoplankton. Great abundances of silica and opal (the preserved material from the phytoplankton shells) in seafloor sediments are evidence of both the blooms and the strong upwelling.  >The upwelling may have been so strong, however, that the phytoplankton did not keep pace with the upwelling—that is, more carbon dioxide upwelled than was used by the phytoplankton. Consequently, the excess carbon dioxide “leaked” back into the atmosphere, adding a greenhouse gas that warmed the planet.  >What shut down the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period about 2.7 million years ago? And what finally caused Northern Hemispheric glaciation at about the same time—but nearly 2 million years after the Isthmus of Panama formed?  >Neal Driscoll and Gerald Haug proposed one solution. They postulated that moisture carried northward by the Gulf Stream was transported by prevailing westerly winds to Eurasia. It fell as rain or snow, eventually depositing more fresh water into the Arctic Ocean—either directly, or via the great Siberian rivers that empty into the Arctic Ocean.  >The added fresh water would have facilitated the formation of sea ice, which would reflect sunlight and heat back into space. It would also act as a barrier blocking heat stored in the ocean from escaping to the atmosphere above the Arctic. Both these phenomena would further cool the high latitudes. In addition, Arctic waters flowing back into the North Atlantic would have become less cold and salty—short-circuiting the efficiency of the Ocean Conveyor belt as a global heat pump to North Atlantic regions.
66373	0	a	49 million years ago, it's thought that there was a huge CO2 decrease because a bunch of water ferns grew on the Arctic Ocean and sank:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla_event  Here's an article about people trying to recreate this event as a climate change mitigation strategy: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-the-fern-that-cooled-the-planet-do-it-again/
66374	0	a	"Wait so in this article it says the azolla event is what created the ""icehouse"" earth, rather than the earth with palm trees and crocodiles at the poles.  So are you and the geologist guy talking about two different steps? Like this azolla event took us down from dinosaur-level warmth, and then way later the closing of the isthmus took us down to the temperature we're at today?"
66375	0	a	I wouldn't necessarily think of it as steps. The Earth's current climate was created over many many millions of years by lots of factors. Positive feedbacks are very important in climate change and the azolla event, while significant in its own right, would have more importantly probably launched several positive feedbacks that contributed to locking up increasing amounts of carbon close to the poles, slowly decreasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature over tens of millions of years.  Simultaneously, other changes causally unrelated to organic carbon sequestration occurred as well and also contributed to the cooling trend. Especially important here are the changes in ocean currents, including the completion of the West Wind Drift, which isolated Antarctica about 30mya and the closing of the Panama isthmus abut 5mya. These effects contribute to their own important positive feedbacks as well as interacting with previous feedbacks.  So none of these things solely created the icehouse Earth of today (though it's hard to know what the effect of any single factor in isolation is because of the many interacting feedbacks), but they all contributed to an ongoing process.
66376	0	a	Yes, there is an ice age still going on. The Earth currently has extensive glaciers and sea ice at both poles. They may not be as extensive as during the last glacial maximum, but their presence diagnoses this as a period of icehouse climate. A greenhouse period would not have any polar ice or at least not glaciers.
66377	0	a	Generally, less temperature disparity means a more temperate planet.  So fewer glaciers and fewer deserts. More temperate.  So there would be more Jungles and forests, fewer Sahara deserts and Ice sheets the size of countries.  It's my only real gripe with the public attention that climate change gets is that very few people actually explain that it does not mean deserts and mass extinctions...quite the opposite in fact. Perhaps that isn't good for the overall optics of the dangers, but it would be more honest.
66378	0	a	Those are called sunspots. They are areas of the sun's surface that are cooler than the rest of it. They're still very hot, just not hot enough for the light they're emitting to be enough to see through eclipse glasses. Basically, there are strong magnetic fields in those locations that are inhibiting the normal surface convection of those areas, thus keeping them somewhat cooler than the rest of the sun.

If you cut a ring from a PVC pipe and mount it on a 12"" stick at one end of the board, and mount a skinny 12"" stick (piece of bamboo tomato stake) in line with it at the other end of the board, you can adjust the height of the skinny stick so that it works like a gunsight.  Point the viewer toward the Sun and watch its shadow on the ground.  You will also see the shadow of the ring and the skinny stick.  When the shadow of the tip of the skinny stick is centered in the shadow of the ring, the Sun will be projected onto your screen.  It takes a little adjustment, but its easy to aim the viewer once you get it aligned.  A good source of white plastic for the screen is a piece cut from the side of a plastic kitty litter jug.  White posterboard or foamboard will also work well.  The distance between the eyepiece and the screen will determine how big a picture you see of the Sun.  If you have the screen close up, you will have a very small image that is very bright, too small and too bright to look at comfortably.  If you move the screen back some, you can get an image of the Sun that is about 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and the sunspots will be easy to see very clearly, while the image will be bright, but not bright enough to make it hard to look at comfortably.  The good thing about the shadow gunsight is that you are always aiming by looking at the ground, instead of peeking over your shoulder to try to find the Sun's location."

66392	0	a	"It can be really really bad.   > A June, 2010 report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), in conjunction with the Department of Energy, warned that ""Geomagnetic storms... not only can develop rapidly but also have continental footprints that can result in widespread, simultaneous impact to many points on the system. The system is not designed to operate through the simultaneous loss of many key assets.... "" Power grids around the world rely on extra-high voltage (EHV) custom-built transformers for power transmission. In an extreme geomagnetic storm, the 2010 NERC report estimates-based on the scenario in Figure 9- that ~350 EHV transformers in the United States ""will exceed levels where the transformer is at risk of irreparable damage,"" collapsing large portions of the power grid. ""These multi-ton apparatus generally cannot be repaired in the field, and if damaged in this manner, they need to be replaced with new units, which have manufacture lead times of 12 months or more"" (National Academy of Sciences, 2008). Full recovery could take 4-10 years (National Academy of Sciences, 2008) [source](http://www.governmentattic.org/24docs/UnpubFEMAgeomagRpts_2010.pdf)  What happens when millions of people lose power, telecom, banking and finance, petroleum and natural gas, transportation, food, water, and emergency services for a year? Let's come back to that.   First let's consider that [according to a commission set up by the House Armed Services Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Baker-Statement-5-13-EMP.pdf), the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) which I mentioned above generally downplays the threat:  > The standards ultimately developed by NERC include a set of operational procedures requiring no physical protection of the electric grid and a scientifically-flawed benchmark GMD threat description that enables most U.S. utilities to avert installing physical protection based on their own paper modeling studies. The benchmark GMD threat description is based on solar storm statistics over the last 25 years during which there were no “Carrington Class” 100-year solar superstorms. The Carrington-class storm GMD levels are an order of magnitude higher than the largest storms in the NERC 25 year data window. NERC’s benchmark event is admissible only if we assume that all eleven-year solar cycles are the same, an assumption known to be incorrect. A skeptic might suspect that the NERC standard’s main objective was to avert liability rather than protect the public from serious GMD consequences.  Okay then, maybe we can shut down the grid at the first sign of trouble to prevent damage?  > The 15-45 minute warning time earlier provided by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite and now supported by the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) successor will be inadequate for grid operators to confer while executing required operational procedures. Participants in the 2011 National Defense University-Johns Hopkins University GMD response exercise indicated that they would be hard-pressed even to get all the players to the table within such a short time interval. And, once hit, the grid would fail quickly. We note that, in 1989, during a moderate solar storm GMD, the electric power grid of the entire Province of Quebec went dark in 92 seconds. The August 2003 Northeast Blackout evolved much more slowly (1:31pm – 4:10pm) with much more time available to take action. Nonetheless, even with a span of hours available, power companies were unable to react fast enough to prevent grid collapse.  > Grid operators will not have adequate information on the state of the grid to implement correct operational procedures. Because most of the grid is not monitored for Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GIC), operators will be “flying blind” with respect to the state of the grid. Operators will not know which portions need remedial action and what actions will be optimal. Information gaps will exist as in August 2003 – where operators were unaware of the initiating tree contact. Sensors needed to monitor GMD/EMP stressors on critical grid components were not required by NERC standards and have not been installed. And this lack of visibility has led and will lead to errors in executing operational procedures.  > There is no control center with large enough visibility to control operational procedure response on a national scale. Lack of information on neighboring interconnections impairs proper procedural response. A national control/coordination center does not exist. And in the Eastern Interconnection, there is no single authority over the nine American regional Reliability Coordinators. Because the geographic coverage of solar storm GMD and nuclear EMP can be continental in scale, sup-regional control visibility and authority are necessary. At this point, only the federal government, using Presidential authority, can fulfill this role.   > Operational procedures have not been adequate to address the much simpler causes of previous large-scale blackouts. For instance, operational procedures proved ineffective in preventing the 2003 Northeast blackout that was precipitated by a single failure point – tree contact with a transmission line. Recent grid models indicate that GMD and EMP will cause hundreds to thousands of failure points. The complexity and rapidity of grid failure during a Carrington-class event will overwhelm the ability of electric utilities to respond and to prevent grid failure using any suite of operational procedures, no matter how well- conceived and practiced. During Hurricane Sandy, grid physical damage outstripped the effectiveness of procedural protection efforts. Physical damage to grid components will be a factor in GMD/EMP events as well.  > Unforeseen grid equipment malfunctions have greatly impaired grid operators’ ability to respond during major blackouts in the past. Operational procedures during the 2003 Northeast blackout were greatly impaired by computer control system malfunctions and software problems. Critical grid state monitoring, logging and alarm equipment failed. The control area’s SCADA and emergency management systems malfunctioned. The shut-down of hundreds of generators over multiple states was unanticipated as was the failure of tens of transmission lines. Confusion and inoperative control systems led to many frantic phone calls. As these events, show, any early failure of major grid components caused by the GMD or EMP environment will impede implementation of subsequent operational procedures.  Great.  Okay well maybe these sorts of huge solar storms don't happen very often. But we know about [a big one that happened in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_2012). It missed the Earth by about 9 days, as the Sun rotates around its own axis with a period of about 25 days. The only reason we know about it is because it happened to hit one of our sun-observing [spacecraft](https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/where/where_is_stereo.gif). So it's really just a matter of time.   Okay, so we can live for a while if the power goes out right? Obviously so. But only for a while. Our modern economy and food delivery systems rely on power and communications.   > “It’s briefly dealt with in the commission report [of 2008]. There are essentially two estimates on how many people would die from hunger, from starvation, from lack of water, and from social disruption. One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90% of the U.S. population would die. We’re talking about total devastation. We’re not talking about just a regular catastrophe.”  I couldn't find that in the report myself but I did find, ""An EMP attack could, in effect, temporarily create in the United States the technological conditions in the food and transportation infrastructures that have resulted in developing world famines."" and ""The human consequences of such a scenario include the social and psychological reactions to a sudden loss of stability in the modern infrastructure over a large area of the country.

66396	0	a	"You mean ""micro gravity"" as ""anti-gravity"" is more of a science fiction term ([micro-gravity is NASA's term](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-microgravity-58.html) about living and working in/on spacecraft). Or more likely just ""weightlessness"".  Female astronauts have the option of carrying their preferred pads or tampons while in space ([Popular Science 2016](http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space)). If they choose to not get their periods they can medically induce amenorrhea, or stop their periods from happening ([The Atlantic 2016](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/04/menstruating-in-space/479229/)). There was [a scientific paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav20168) written on medically induced amenorrhea in female astronauts in 2016.   There are several ways to induce amenorrhea, through hormonal pills, injections or intrauterine device (IUDs). While it is safe to have your period in space, it may not be all that convenient to switch pads or tampons and deal with disposal. The water treatment is also set up to recycle water from urine, but not menstrual blood so that is also an issue ([American Chemical Society 2014](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2014/acs-presspac-april-9-2014/recycling-astronaut-urine-for-energy-and-drinking-water.html)).  According to National Geographic (link below) if a woman spent three years in space she would need about 1,100 pills, which adds some weight to a mission but is less unwieldy than many tampons. Alternatively, three years worth of tampons (or pads) still weighs more than three years worth of pills.  Female astronauts' periods have a long history. National Geographic has a great opening paragraph in one of [their articles](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/22/how-do-women-deal-with-having-a-period-in-space/) on the subject:  >Sally Ride’s tampons might be the most-discussed tampons in the world. Before Ride became the first American woman in space, scientists pondered her tampons, weighed them, and NASA’s professional sniffer smelled them—better to take deodorized or non-deodorized?—to make sure they wouldn’t smell too strongly in a confined space capsule. Engineers considered exactly how many she might need for a week in space. (Is 100 the right number?, they famously asked her. No, Ride said. That is not the right number.)"
66397	0	a	I think what you were getting at is how does the blood come out without gravity? Because in that case it actually doesn't require gravity, the muscles in the uterus push it out sufficiently enough that it's unnecessary to worry about, but the comments about how you would deal with it are all correct and quite frankly hilarious on the scientists part. As a physicist who is a part of mission planning it's obvious that none of the men (who make of 90% of the field) would have any idea how to deal with such an issue.   Edit: source!

66398	0	a	Are astronauts required to have appendicectomies and cholecystectomies prior to their mission? If so, what about endometrial ablation? Given the radiation in space, have any female astronauts gone on to have kids? If so, have they turned out 'normal'?
66399	0	a	Addendum: Now that I am at my computer, I can source/edit the post for those interested.  The three predominant modalities previously used were depot medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera), danazol, or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) in suppression-dosing fashion (RT Jennings & ES Baker's chapter from Principles of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight by Barratt 1st Ed 2008). Suppression dosing means that they would skip the placebo week and restart a new pack every three weeks to cause amenorrhea. The most common choice was OCPs which would make since given the more abnormal bleeding patterns we may see initially with Depo and the fear of bone mineral density effects that both space and Depo could play (Knunitz 2009). Though it must be noted, that OCPs were not without risk either. Depot medroxyprogesterone is a progesterone-only contaceptive; the most common OCPs contain estrogen and progesterone. Exogenous estrogen may increase the risk for venous thromboembolism given female astronauts now meet Virchow's Triad of hypercoaguability caused by the estrogen, stasis in space, and trauma that occurs. Dr. Varsha Jain at Kings College London is an expert on this and has a freely-available lecture online [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150001648.pdf).   As others have mentioned, the ISS can recycle urine, but not blood and thus not having any bleeding was strongly desired. If women were done with childbearing, they sometimes would perform an endometrial ablation to prevent bleeding. This was preferred over a hysterectomy because they would prefer not to create adhesions in the abdomen and put astronauts at risk for bowel obstruction etc while in space. This is again discussed in the chapter by Jennings linked above. Currently, Mirena IUDs are preferred. This is more appropriate modality in that it can cause amenorrhea, decrease risk of endometrial cancer, act as highly-effective birth control, and decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) by not giving exogenous estrogen.   Edit 2: I would have loved to answer more of the questions on here or respond with valid peer-reviewed sources, however, Mods locked the thread. Feel free to ask other questions as well if you would like. I am an OBGYN with a strong interest in space medicine. Sorry for the delay in editing/providing sources.

They probably thought ""What's the average amount of pads used per day? 3-6? Ok lets say 8 to be safe. How many days will the period last for? 2-7? Ok lets say 10 to be safe."" That gives you 80 per week right there, plus NEVER having experience a period in space, there was no way to plan for what might happen."

66402	0	a	Thank you for someone actually answering the question. Yeah it helps to know they can stop their periods,  but you finally came in and told us that periods work the same without gravity.
66403	0	a	No, astronauts are not required to have appendectomies, much less cholecystectomies (which are quite a bit riskier).  And the radiation exposure in space is about 10-20 times higher than on Earth. So spending, say, six months on ISS is like spending 5-10 years on Earth. Do you know any women who spent 5-10 years on Earth and went on to have normal children?

Given the radiation in space, have any female astronauts gone on to have kids? If so, have they turned out 'normal'?   NASA absolutely does not surgically alter their astronauts. As for radiation, both men and women in the Corps are advised to avoid pregnancy for up to one year after living aboard the Space Station, in part, due to radiation, but also due to the physiological changes that occur in the microgravity environment
66405	0	a	Better to be prepared and have too much than too little. They also were uncertain of the medical issues of menstruating and whether or not the uterus would be able to expel the shed lining in zero gravity or if it were possible for the lining to move up into the fallopian tubes (retrograde menstruation) ([Popular Science 2016](http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space)). Luckily for women astronauts, things still work as intended in space. 
66406	0	a	> 3-6? Ok lets say 8 to be safe.   >2-7? Ok lets say 10 to be safe.  I wonder if there's a preferred number of standard deviations above the mean for worst-case-scenario planning in general. You want to have enough supplies for outlier situations, but not too many to fit in the available space.   20 standard deviations is probably too many; 1 certainly isn't enough. Would 3 or 4 be a safe, non-excessive number?   
66407	0	a	The uterus still contracts to expel the lining. It may take a little longer without gravity, but likely not significantly longer. There is nothing extra astronauts do to stimulate uterine contractions or lining expulsion.

66430	0	a	"You've already had this covered well enough, but...  Think of it this way:  I have my vagina.  It's a tunnel a few inches long.  It's the place where the fun happens when sexy times are going on. :)  My cervix is  around the end of this.  The cervix connects  the vagina to the uterus.  The cervix is basically a muscle ring that spends it's whole life clenched tightly.  It's job is to keep stuff--except sperm--out of the womb.  The womb is there the baby making happens.  think of it as a sack, or a balloon or something. It's got space on the inside.  When we have a period, what's basically happening is that the inner layer of the womb is peeling off.  This inner layer has a lot of blood vessels in it, because it's supposed to be ripe delicious ground for a fertilized egg to rest.  So when it starts peeling off, there's a lot of blood and juice and stuff.  So, it's basically an open, weeping wound. Heavy days are when the bleeding is heavier.  Lighter days are when the bleeding is lighter.  There are some actions we can take that can ...  adjust the rate at which blood leaves our body, so to speak.  For example, laying down allows blood to pool, both in the womb and in the vaginal canal.  Blood flow is lessened as a result, however, when you stand up, gravity WILL kick back in.  (for comedy, this can result in, in the morning, laying stone still as one feels that there is a lot of blood inside them....  then the QUICK leap up out of bed, clutching one's crotch and fleeing to bathroom.)  Actions that involve contracting the womb can make more blood come out--as the womb already contracts itself to try and push blood out.  excersize, activity, orgasm and similar can have the same result.  Being still can result in blood pooling inside.  Every womb-owner has experienced, say, going through a class, and feeling fine in regards to if they need to change their tampons, then standing up, and realizing that no, they need to go NOW.  but we can't really effect the heavy/light-ness of our period.  We can't control how bad the wound is bleeding, so to speak.  Typically, you start with light days, then heavy days, then light days again.  so, again, think of it as a water ballon or something, attached to some flexible tubing.  the water's leaking out at a relatively set rate (that may be light, heavy or anything in between) ... and the water finds all sorts of places to go, and changing the orientation of the tubing can result in pooled fluid being released from the ""tide pools"" so to speak."
66431	0	a	FYI, uterine muscle is smooth muscle, and is therefore NOT under voluntary control. Fun fact: The same hormones the body uses to trigger uterine contractions to expel the uterine lining also affects OTHER nearby smooth muscle organs. AKA, your intestines. Hence, uterine cramps are almost always accompanied by crampy, painful, loose period shits. It's like goddamn pelvic floor dubstep going on down there sometimes. 
66432	0	a	You can't control it. Heavy flow days means more comes out, you can feel the difference, but you can't do anything about it. And there certainly is a difference! Heavy flow days can mean 90 ml of blood. Light days can mean 1-5.

66446	0	a	It's a self feeding, self-sustaining feedback. You're trying to analyze only one part, but it's a loop from a very complex entanglement of magnetic fields. This is hard to recreate in a lab, but can be done with molten sodium, for example. Anything with a lot of energy can cause charged particles. There is a lot of heat and friction, so this is expected. Since each charge has its own electric field, and it's all moving from thermal activity, a moving charge generates a magnetic field. There's your weak magnetic field. Now the feedback occurs from its self sustaining nature.  Hopefully that makes sense.

66448	0	a	To understand why not, you have to understand how a battery works. It's not a tank of electrons, exactly. A battery is a chemical reaction between an anode (-), cathode (+), and an electrolyte (or some form of conduit) which facilitates the exchange of electrons.  When you discharge (use) a battery, a chemical reaction is occurring, moving electrons between the two chemicals (anode and cathode). So, don't think of a battery as a vessel which just holds a pile of electricity. It's a specific transfer of energy between two chemicals.  Now, in a rechargeable battery, this reaction can be reversed by applying electricity using a charger. But, again, it's not adding anything, really. It's reversing the chemical reaction which is putting the chemicals back to their original state.  When charging, it takes time for the reaction to reverse and at the same time, heat is created because the electrons are moving back across the conduit they travelled across originally. Electrons moving over a conductor meet resistance which creates heat, no matter which direction. Much like the battery heating up when you use the phone, the battery will heat up while charging for the same reason. If you were to throw a bunch of current at the battery, it could easily cause a thermal issue. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd: pronounced Nye-Cad) batteries had a problem called thermal runaway where the battery, if charged too quickly, the heat generated could induce a self-feeding loop where the battery could heat to a point of ignition or explosion. But that's not an issue with Lead-Acid batteries (like sealed lead acid batteries like in your car, which use a liquid electrolyte, also known as a wet cell [thanks to u/gilescoreywasframed for the correction below]). Also prone are Lithium Ion (LiOn, like in your cell phone) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-PO) batteries (credit to u/incrediboy729 for the correction here), but these usually incorporate circuitry to prevent this situation.  tl;dr - it is dangerous, and modern cell phone chargers and batteries have circuitry to prevent too fast/overcharging which could lead to heat damage or fire.
66449	0	a	This is what we're hoping to be able to do with [graphene batteries](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/phys.org/news/2016-07-fast-charging-everlasting-battery-power-graphene.amp)   They are an example of a supercapacitor, a battery able to physically hold onto electrons. You'd be able to plug it in, fill it up and go on with your life in a matter of seconds.  This is very different from our current technologies, all of which use an electrical current to reverse a chemical reaction. As everyone is saying this process necessarily takes a while and is fairly inefficient, hence battery chargers getting hot, heat production=wasted energy. This is essentially the same difference between lightbulb types. Incandescents are very inefficient, so they get very hot, CFLs are fairly efficient so they only get warm and LEDs are very efficient so they barely produce heat at all.
66450	0	a	In short - heat.  Cells (because the world is a collection of bodges) have chemistry that creates internal resistances, and that means heat is generated in charging much as passing current through any wire.  Fast chargers (usually rebadges of Qualcomm QuickCharge) negotiate upto 12v charging adjusting the current to reduce heat build up getting out of control.  What you want CAN however be done with supercapacitors - they're basically chemistry-free, and are constantly evolving.  Soon we'll likely be seeing them in cellphones, but they're not ready quite yet.  You can charge them to capacity very quickly.

66453	0	a	Fast chargers use the same electronics as mentioned before to prevent heat build up and overcharging. They are capable of delivering higher doses of amperage but are still limited if the battery says it's getting too hot.  Basically, fast chargers have the *capability* to charge faster, but are still limited by the battery.

66455	0	a	I've read that it was a design flaw with the batteries and their internal structure which led to short circuits. It wasn't a failure of the chargers, but rather the batteries themselves and either a quality control problem with the supplier or just a flat out flaw in the design.  Edit: I found [this](https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-return-exchange-faq/) which not only explains why the batteries were failing but also has a pretty nice diagram of the internal structure of a LiOn battery.  
66456	0	a	This was the same reason why the note 7 explosions happened. I was actually pretty bummed when I had to give mine back. But essentially, there is a barrier between the cathode and anode. In order to cram more juice into the battery the manufacturer reduces the barrier between them. If the barrier is damaged, the electrons can flow freely between the cathode and anode causing a short circuit. This in turn creates an insane amount of heat destroying the barrier, and causing a more intense short circuit. The energy released by this takes on the form of an explosion. 
66457	0	a	It wasn't just that, but Samsung engineered out the space around the battery that it needed to use to expand as all batteries do a bit. That force on the battery caused the two electrodes to contact and short-circuited the batteries.
66458	0	a	Electricity is run on an alternating current (AC) which reverses voltage in the pattern of a sine wave. In the US, the frequency of this alternating is 60 Hz, which is a B flat (more of a flat B or sharp B flat, really). Sometimes interactions with surroundings, especially at high voltages like in transformers, can cause a hum at the frequency the grid is run on. In most of Europe, as an example, it's run at 50 Hz not 60 Hz, so you would hear a G (a little sharp) instead of a B flat.
66459	0	a	In the US, alternating current (AC) oscillates at 60Hz and the buzzing you hear is generated by the second harmonic, so 120Hz. The nearest B-flat is at 116.54Hz, so it's pretty close! The next B is at 123.47Hz, so really you're hearing something that is very much in the middle of B and B-flat. If you were in Europe, where the standard is 50Hz, you'd be hearing something between G (98Hz) and G-sharp (103.83Hz).  Also, excellent ear, are you a musician?
66460	0	a	"A lot of answers here are ""electricity is produced at 60Hz in the united states""  but none of them are answering why this is the case,  the frequency of AC mains power is selected to give Synchronous motors attached to grid power directly good operating characteristics. that is, stuff like vacuum cleaners, washing machines, fans for air systems etc.  These are most electric motors that plug into the wall that don't have a special power distribution mechanism built in, those that do have this kind of frequency controller hardware are called Variable Frequency Drives and are often used where the speed of the drive needs to vary rapidly.  VFDs are limited to industrial use for the most part.  *****  The reason the frequency matters for Synchronous motors has to do with the physical design of alternating current motors and the geometry, but the simple explanation is that for simple synchronous motors the speed of the motor in RPMs is dependent on the supplied frequency because the physical rotation of the motor is being driven by the rotation of a magnetic field and the magnetic field is going to rotate at the frequency of the alternating current in AC Synchronous motors.  If we imagine the motor in its most simple state as a set of magnets with a single North and South pole on the rotating part of the motor (the rotor) and a single North and South pole on the stationary part of the motor (the stator).    Our AC mains power drives the Stator magnets, and the magnets on the rotor is a fixed magnet, the rotor spins in normal operation as the poles on the stator switch positions, and the permanent magnet moves to correct its alignment.  With only one set of poles, the rotor speed will match the mains power speed, making one full rotation for each full cycle of switch in polarity.  In real motors the speed will be some multiple of the frequency because multiple poles are used as they provide better torque.  because of this 60 Hz in the US, and 50 Hz is Europe was selected because it allows motor designers to easily build motors that will operate at safe speeds and torques when connected to mains power.  EDIT: added information about how poles work in a motor "
66461	0	a	"Good answer! To expand on this, in the industry we call it ""60 cycle hum"":  Electrical current flow creates a magnetic field, and transformers have cores made of ferrous metal.  So the changing alternating-current is causing the big metal cores to move a little bit in a way that matches the rate at which the current changes.  The fundamental frequency is 60Hz like our power frequency, but because of a phenomenon called [""magnetostriction""](http://tdvib.com/magnetostriction/) the transformer iron vibrates at twice that rate, or 120Hz.  If an electrical load on a piece of equipment screws up that normal 60Hz current we can absolutely hear it:  Transformers that have a ton of current harmonics no longer produce a nice ""60 cycle hum"", but can have a much louder, sharper buzz that sounds very noticeably different."

I had also just done a ton of research before buying a gaming monitor and once confused operating frequency for frame rate.

66465	0	a	Other way around, motors were built to match the electric frequency. 50/60 hertz were selected due to a number of factors including generator design, size of transformers, and flickering lights.
66466	0	a	I remember years ago reading that power plants couldn't keep the output exactly at 60Hz (there would always be slight variations) but they were able to keep the average frequency at 60 (by slightly raising and lowering the frequency) which they did so that all the electrical clocks that kept time via the cycles would remain more or less accurate. Do they still bother doing this, now that most clocks use quartz  or internet connectivity to stay accurate?
66467	0	a	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequency#Time_error_correction_.28TEC.29  According to wikipedia its still done today, but I am 99% sure it isn't. The grid today is kept very close to 60 because the north american networks are huge.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_U.S._power_transmission_grid#/media/File:NERC-map-en.svg  The frequency of the grid is consistent across an interconnection, so any drop in load or pickup of generation can only have a minimal effect on the grid frequency. Variations do occur during large system events, but those are very rare. Frequency isn't shared between interconnections because they are connected through DC lines. 'Island' systems with much smaller load/generation have a much harder time maintaining a conistent 60Hz.
66468	0	a	"All hydro, gas, nuclear, and coal plants connected to the grid have governor systems which control the amount of fuel (water, steam, etc) entering the turbine in an attempt to keep the system frequency at 60Hz. If system frequency falls, all generator governors connected to the grid pass more fuel to the turbine to speed it up. The opposite is true for high frequency. A perfect 60Hz AC on the grid requires an exact balance of generation and demand, but since load is varying all the time, frequency is mostly maintained within about 59.98 to 60.02 Hz. Beyond these ranges, if frequency starts to get really bad (like 59.8 to 60.2 Hz), then special protection systems will automatically disconnect loads or generators to return the frequency to normal. Since the Eastern and Western halves of North America are separate synchronous grids (with the exception of Quebec and Texas), every region in each of those grids has to be perfectly balanced to maintain frequency. If the grid as a whole has been under or over generated for a significant amount of time, it produces ""time error"", the slowing or speeding of a clock which runs on the 60Hz mains frequency compared to a reference clock. In the Eastern interconnect, time error is measured and recorded by one system operator designated the Time Monitor. Once time error exceeds 10 seconds positive or negative, all system operators in the interconnect participate in a ""time error correction"", in which they change their scheduled system frequency to 59.98 or 60.02Hz. This causes their automatic generation control systems (fast moving regulation for small changes in demand without requiring redispatch of the whole generation fleet) to trend generation slightly high or low for a time, reversing the time error until it reaches around 0 seconds again. If you look for time error correction on NERC's website, it dives into a lot of detail. Whether or not this is still necessary, I don't really know, but time error correction is definitely still done. "
66469	0	a	The reason it's only half of Japan is because in the 19th century, western Japan imported its generating equipment from Germany (50Hz) while eastern Japan imported equipment from the U.S. (60Hz), and by the time the whole country was electrified, it would have been vastly too expensive and a massive pain in the ass to unify the two separate grids. Nowadays it only comes up in odd situations (like when Fukushima knocked out a chunk of the east's generating capacity) because virtually all consumer electrical goods are compatible with both 50Hz and 60Hz. (There are also three converting stations but their capacity isn't huge.)
66470	0	a	I dispatch the electric grid for a living. We absolutely still do time error corrections.   It's impossible to keep the grid at exactly 60Hz forever. Even if it's slow by .001Hz, it will need correcting eventually.   The actual frequency is constantly changing due to load changes. 
66471	0	a	The frequency is directly linked to the mechanical rotation of the turbine. Less demand means less load, which means the turbine can spin faster.
66472	0	a	Former zookeeper here: I’ve only personally worked with lesser apes, but from my observations they either squat to use their urine to scent mark, or just pee from their perch. No hands involved. Ring tailed lemurs (not an ape, but a tangentially related fun fact) will pee on their tails, then flick the scent at each other.   The rest of the great apes have much much smaller penis to body size ratios than humans do. Gorillas are only about the size of your pinky. Also unlike humans, most apes have a penis bone, which means their flaccid penis is much less “floppy.” So humans have a much different penis anatomy than other apes, which could lead to the behavioral difference of holding it while you pee.
66473	0	a	Human male penis size relative to body size is VASTLY greater than other apes (and almost every other mammal). This is likely due to a number of reasons, although it’s important to understand that physical evolutionary traits are not being governed by some conscious force trying to get optimal results, so it could just be a random genetic mutational accident that we have since compensated for (as long as it doesn’t seriously inhibit reproduction then a trot won’t be selected against).  First, is that we have a very low degree of sexual dimorphism compared to other apes (and many mammals in general). A male gorilla with a penis the same proportions as their body compared to humans would potentially cause a lot of pain from ripping and tearing the relatively much smaller female gorillas, for example (especially considering they don’t generally give the female any time to “warm up” and get the natural lubricant flowing).  Second, female sexual pleasure is an important part of human mating, and encourages more frequent reproduction opportunities compared to animals that don’t have this trait. Other traits that contribute to this effect in humans are frequent menstrual cycles concealed estrus. Instead of a yearly period of “heat,” human females are available for insemination at regular, frequent intervals. It’s apparent in other species when the female is fertile, but human females do not exhibit engorged and discolored labia, nor do they exhibit strong pheromones during their period of receptivity to being impregnated. All of this contributes to increased mating opportunities. It also contributes to a confusion about paternal parentage, which seriously reduces the amount of babies killed by dominant males that only want females to spend their time and energy caring for their children (since any of the kids given birth to by a female they have mated with could be theirs), which would otherwise be common, and is still frequently seen when males from outside a group take over that group (they can safely kill all the kids because they definitely aren’t theirs). But that’s not relevant to the current discussion; I just wanted to point out how these things aren’t only related to the same root causes as increased penis size, and how they may not really be related to penis size at all. Some of these factors are also present in other primates, not just us.  Third is the phenomenon of a sperm arms race, due to the aforementioned incentive for frequent copulation of females with multiple males in the same general time period. When multiple males inseminate a female around the same time, the one that gets their sperm the furthest in has a better chance. Ejaculation velocity and sperm “swimming” speed are also important, but sperm can be relatively slow to get going through the first parts of the vagina, so those things being equal, a longer penis equals enhanced reproductive capabilities. Gorillas, for example, typically only have one male attempting copulation within their harem at any one time, so there is no need for sperm competition.  If you look outside apes to other primates, there are a bunch of monkeys that have similar penis ratios, likely for similar reasons, so we’re not exclusive with this particular trait. We do have very small testicles relative to our body weight, compared with other apes, but I haven’t studied the reasons for this as much so I’ll just leave it at that, except to say that chimpanzees probably have even more sperm competition than humans ever did, but they don’t have larger penises, and that’s probably because their testes are over 33% the size of their brains, while ours are a paltry 3%. This is because their solution to this sperm competition is to use their massive testicles to copulate with females many times a day, every day, whereas if humans attempt this, their sperm count drops drastically after only two ejaculations a day.  There are a variety of other factors to consider, such as our tendency towards monogamy and how it clashes with some of these other theories. We could have moved closer to monogamy relatively recently, but conflicting with that is the fact that Humans have remarkably smooth penises, which is generally found in monogamous species. Polygynous species usually have odd proportions such as huge heads that act as a plug, or bumps and ridges and extreme curvatures, etc. Human males also are quite a bit bigger than females, just not as much as some other species.  Edit: I meant to respond to the other comment about this, not the main post.

A fun accident, as it were.    The thing is, though, she seems to ignore the idea that *even if* the female orgasm is just the developmental byproduct of the male orgasm, pleasure from the female side *could have* put positive pressure on the ‘happy orgasm’ trait in general.

66484	0	a	Primatologist here. I worked with Spider Monkeys in Belize and we observed areas under trees where there was a large amount of fecal buildup. It wasn’t clear if these were actual latrines or if these areas just coincided with preferred sleeping spots. We noted every time one of these spots were utilized and it was pretty rare that they were used outside of sleeping times. They did forage in these areas during the day and they did not exclusively use the “latrine” areas to go to the bathroom.   The only primates that have had latrine behaviour documented are lemurs. Remember that lemurs are actually fairly separated on the evolutionary chain from New World and Old World primates and tend to have more primitive characteristics. Thus, this behaviour may be a primitive hold out.   Source: https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/85/3/420/900401
66485	0	a	It isn't a design flaw, because it isn't by design. Evolution doesn't plan ahead. We started like every other primate, genitals tucked under and intercourse from behind; missionary position isn't something you see a lot outside humans.  When some mutation made us start to stand more erect, we were not designed for it (hips, pelvis, etc.); but it was so advantageous it overcame the negative points that came with it. Being able to sprint is such a big evolutionary deal we can deal with childbirth and intercourse not working the way it had for millions of years. Some stuff is cramped, some stuff is out of place, but whatever.  Don't think 'someone screwed up their design'; think 'when something better came along, the other parts of us had to deal with it best they could'.
66486	0	a	I've seen the video you referenced and I tend to agree with that theory. The action of cervix rhythmically dipping into the semen pool during orgasm - *to me* - seems to strongly suggest that that motion coupled with strong euphoric orgasm greatly promotes the odds and paths of sperm reaching the fallopian tubes as well as encouraging further copulation due to the pleasure, further improving odds, as well as bonding.

66490	0	a	It depends a lot on the insect in question.  The most extreme example I can think of is the [honeypot ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant). Some members of these colonies become living food storage for the rest, hanging in place and taking in or giving out their stored reserves as needed. 
66491	0	a	Bloodsucking insects will become engorged after feeding. Mosquitos, bed bugs, lice, ticks, fleas, ticks (arachnid), are visibly larger after feeding.  Perhaps more relevant is the Fat Body.  Insects have an organ called the Fat Body. Lipids (fats) are stored here in adipocytes in the form of triglycerides (same way mammals store fat, essentially). These lipids are consumed during periods of high energy demand (like when flying), and are replenished in periods of food abundance.   Some insects have been shown to increase the size of the Fat Body in the winter, as a mechanism to enhance survival. Other insects (like house flies) don't seem to be able to store extra fat.   edited to add some sources:   Study on fat storage in Culex pipiens: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2769712/  review paper on the insect Fat Body:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075550/
66492	0	a	Many insects have a part of their lifecycle dedicated to collecting and storing energy and another part where they can't collect energy, and can only live off of their stored reserves. Lots of species of moth spend their larval stage eating, then form a cocoon and emerge as an adult without a digestive system at all. Their adult stage is dedicated to mating and laying eggs, which will hatch into larvae and repeat the cycle.

Obviously, that's a bad spot to put itself into. I'd assume they know to stop before they pop themselves, but it seemed like the one that bit me took it too far.

66503	0	a	"Some blood feeding insects (ex. mosquitoes, phlebotomine sandflies to name a few) undergo a process known as prediuresis,  in which they excrete urine as they feed in order to concentrate the blood protein (the nutrient rich part which they need) and filter our the ""junk"" (ex. water, parts of the blood that are not needed). This reduces their weight & allows them (most of the time) to fly off after they have finished feeding. This allows them to retain all the nutrients they need, while maintaining a weight which allows them to fly. If you let a mosquito feed for a couple of minutes, you'll see a bunch of liquid droplets fall! It's pretty interesting, but don't try that at home - I did it in a lab where the mosquitoes were bred & they were not carrying any pathogens.  To answer the question you've asked, there is a mechanism that tells them when to stop, but I don't know exactly how it works. Hopefully someone who knows something about that can comment!

66505	0	a	When we're able to grow ants with abdomens the size of melons I will be terrified of them escaping.

They have a heart, but it is near their backs instead of near their front like ours. While our blood stays in tubes all the time, some of their blood squishes around in an open space called the hemocoel (""blood space"").  Instead of using blood to move oxygen and carbon dioxide, their air tubes (which are spread around their bodies) take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. Blood can be different colors. Our blood is red due to hemoglobin, the stuff in our red blood cells that lets us move oxygen and carbon dioxide. Since insects don't move these gases in their blood, their blood doesn't have hemoglobin and is generally not red."
66507	0	a	A lot of organisms that are very small don't need oxygen carriers (hemoglobin) to meet their metabolic demands. They can survive just with the diffusion of oxygen into their system from the atmosphere.
66508	0	a	Does the exoskeleton expand and shrink as well? Or is there some sort of matrix between the fat cells?
66509	0	a	I wouldn't necessarily say that an ant colony is a single organism, but colony insects certainly evolve as though they were a single organism. When only one member of the population reproduces, evolution proceeds quite differently. Most creatures evolve according to what is best for individual survival and reproduction, but ants have no evolutionary pressure to preserve the individual - a population's ability to procreate is affected only by the survival of the queen. A queen whose offspring behaved to maximize their own survival will not do as well as a queen whose offspring are expendable. Worker ants do not have the same kind of self preservation instinct that mammals do, because their evolution is guided by what is most effective at feeding and protecting the queen rather than natural selection pressuring for individual survival. A queen ant's survival strategy is essentially to have a zillion non-fertile babies who will take care of its every need and do not have offspring of their own. Because worker insects do not reproduce on their own, they evolve to benefit their queen instead of to benefit themselves. The whole colony's evolutionary path is determined by the well-being of a single organism.   Ants, bees, and other colony insects are called eusocial animals, which means that they have evolved to prioritize the good of the population as a whole rather than the good of the individual.
66510	0	a	It's like a single organism in that the individual ants are similar to cells in a body, different types specialized for specific roles in order to make sure the colony itself prospers. 
66511	0	a	Which is why insect size has shrunk proportionally to the reduction of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere over time.  
66512	0	a	"I study infectious diseases, including parasites of aquatic insects. One parasite I study is a nematode that infects the aquatic larvae of mayflies. Toward the end of summer, when the nematode and mayfly life cycles are about to move to their next stage, the mayfly may have nothing left inside its exoskeleton except brain and worm. The worm at this point has stolen pretty much all possible nutrients from the mayfly without killing it, and usually takes up most of the body cavity, but the places that are not full of worm are often just hollow. I can't even see guts, let alone fat stores, under the microscope. In unparasitized mayflies, the ""abdomen"", or rear third, of the insect is mostly filled with white stuff that doesn't look unlike cotton stuffing (fat stores), plus a small tube of intestine down the center. There are also some kidney like organs that excrete dissolved waste, but they are really small.  I do not know if the worm consumes the fat stores directly, or if it siphons off energy some other way, but if you imagine a hollow exoskeleton that is what you would see. If you dissect the worm out (as I have done way too many times), you are usually left with a hollow insect, especially if the worm is far along.  I also study Tobacco Hornworms and their parasitic wasps. In the caterpillars, the fat is stored as white blobs that kind of looks like clots or something, between the skin and guts. When they are parasitized, the wasp larvae live between the skin and guts and the clots are absent. Again, I don't know if the cells are completely gone, or just empty and shrunk tinier than I can see, or what.  EDIT: Too many apostrophes and not enough commas.  EDIT2: Realized I didn't answer the question of if the exo-skeleton expands or not. While there are some soft tissues that allow the exoskeleton (or integument in science speak) to flex and expand/contract, it generally only changes size when an insect molts. When the insides shrink due to dehydration or something (and I imagine with major fat loss) they will start to pull away from the exoskeleton. Honestly though, I'm starting to think we should starve some insects and then cut them open so we really know.  [PICS](https://imgur.com/a/8pZzZ)"
66513	0	a	I have a Ph.D. in biology and I still found that absolutely disgusting
66514	0	a	"I have no idea, and one of my more ""controversial"" ideas is that the worm is actually performing many of the metabolic jobs that keep the mayfly alive. I do not know how the nematode steals energy and nutrients from the mayfly. I am not sure anyone knows.   >How does the parasite live once it kills the host?  Oh-ho my friend, this is the weirdest part! The mayfly transforms into a flying adult with the worm still inside it. If the mayfly is a male, the worm secretes hormones that ""femenize"" it, and make it look and act like a female. Instead of trying to mate, infected mayflies (male and female) fly back to the water to try and lay eggs. What actually happens is the worm crawls out, the mayfly dies, and then the worm lays *its* eggs.  As far as I know the explanation for why the worm bothers femenizing the males and going through the whole metamorphosis thing is to expand its ability to move from one place to another.  I think you are going to have to dive into the academic literature if you want to learn more.
