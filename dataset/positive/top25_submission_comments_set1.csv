"Note to the mods: My qualifications to answer the question are at the end, and I've put some decent sources for the history of weeds (which I've read and have informed this writing) at the end. I do not directly reference texts, since I can't find any peer-reviewed work that *directly* references the transition in perception from ""forage plant"" to ""weed"" for *Taraxacum* spp.    --------------------  A legitimate **short answer** is simple: the dandelion (*Taraxacum* genus, but most often *T. officinale* in N. America) is *not* known as ""nothing more than a pesky weed."" You can find it in spring mixes in N. American grocery stores, some people still cultivate it for various reasons, and some people still forage for it in the spring when the leaves are best used in salads.   The **slightly longer answer** is: many Americans and Canadians (and likely other folk as well) now buy most of their food from grocery stores rather than produce (or collect) their own. In cultures where foraging is still commonly practiced (like my native Southern Appalachia), dandelion greens are collected in the spring along with other delicacies (such as ramps, poke salat, scallions, *Morchella* spp. or morels, chicory, and about a gazillion more). For most others, who don't forage *any* foods at all, dandelions have become a pest in lawns. Even though many people might eat dandelion leaves in restaurants or in prepackaged greens from a grocery, they don't recognize what they are eating (and those are generally farmed rather than foraged). *Because dandelions were introduced (or invasive) species to the Americas, and because they are often not where people want them (i.e., in the middle of your front lawn), they have been recently classified as weeds.* There are a couple of non-dandelion-specific reasons for this.  1. The urbanization of the population of western nations means that *most* people now have a different relationship to plants than their ancestors did, say, 150 or more years ago. Industrialization clearly plays a role in this, as does increased wealth. Foraging as a common subsistence activity has become more and more rare in the first world, and is mostly a *cultural* rather than necessary economic practice in N. America. Native peoples and some other groups (""back to the earthers,"" amateur mycologists, foodies, etc.) are either still foraging or *learning* to forage.  2. With increasing wealth in the 20th C., and especially since the end of WWII, the rise of ""suburbanization"" has meant that many people now have *lawns* (something that in the 19th C. and before was a luxury of the ultra-wealthy). While a dandelion in a non-agricultural field is still considered to be not a weed (*Taraxacum* is not on any US noxious weed lists I'm aware of), if it interferes with the growth of a crop or the growth of a pretty lawn, many people would then consider it a weed. The same is true of other generally benign plants (various wild roses, wild lettuces from *Lactuca*, milkweed species, etc.): they are often highly desirable in certain contexts (""natural"" settings), but pests when they are ""in the wrong place"" (cropland or your yard). This is complicated by the next piece of background:  3. ""Weeds"" often evolve to mimic or live *among* cultivated species. This can easily be seen in Western N. America, where invasive grasses like *Bromus tectorum* (Cheatgrass) have evolved to live quite happily in wheat fields, where humans conveniently collect their seed, spread it far and wide, and replant it all over the world  (which is how it got to N. America in the first place in the 19th C.). In the case of *Taraxacum* spp., the advent of lawn mowers and home use of herbicides has selected for ever more irritating lawn-invaders (which grow lower to the ground, are herbicide resistant, can make many flower-bearing stems per rosette per year, etc.). It's very much like the classic ""Red Queen"" evolutionary story, with *Taraxacum* becoming ""lawn parasites"" thanks to environmental pressures provided by humans.  4. Post WWII, the wide availability of chemicals for home-use (fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides) meant that lawn-care companies and chemical manufacturers had (and still have) a financial stake in promoting the perception that ""anything not intentionally planted in your yard is weeds."" Thusly, ""Weed and Feed"" products specifically targeting *Taraxacum* and other common broadleaf plants are a hot-ticket this time of year in N. America. You can find pictures of dandelions on many, many bags of chemicals in hardware stores, feed stores, and groceries in almost all urban and rural areas of the US and Canada.  **tl;dr**: Very few people intentionally eat dandelion greens these days (although that is changing), and fewer still intentionally forage (or cultivate) them. Lawns have become popular for various reasons (symbol of wealth, fun for the kids, etc.), and dandelions tend to get in the way of (many) homeowners' obsession with grasses. Home lawn-care companies and chemical manufacturers have done their best (quite successfully) to paint the dandelion as a target for an array of products.   **N.B.s** Although the ""popular"" perception of the Dandelion is that it is an invader of N. America, the USDA now recognizes a native subspecies of *T. officnale* in the western and arctic regions of N. America. It is one of most widespread plant genera on the planet. There are *a lot of different species, subspecies, and hybrids of Taraxacum*. I have no idea how the Europeans perceive the dandelion now, although in the past it was considered a valuable medicinal and forage plant, which is how my (mostly Welsh) ancestors knew about the plant and managed to pass that knowledge along to us (by making us go out and pick baskets of the stuff every spring).   ---------------------------  *Why I'm qualified to answer the question*: I'm trained as a plant and fungal ecologist, and now work as social-ecological scientist (studying the intersection of human and ""natural"" systems, with an emphasis on hysteresis effects and plant-human interactions). Hysteresis effects, in ecology, are when past events (often human actions) have persistent, and often dramatic, effects on the current state of a system. Changes in *human culture* can be legitimate causes of hysteresis effects as much as biophysical, geological, or agricultural events. Before getting my PhD in ecology, I taught natural history courses in an Appalachian Studies department at an eastern University, and we would often discuss the *oral* history (and knowledge) of forage plants, weeds, and the changing relationship of humans to the environment. I've also read a fair amount of ""environmental history,"" especially the literature devoted to the relationship of humans to plants through time.   -------------------------  **Sources and Further Reading**  * Jenkins, V.

"So, dandelions. First, in terms of the Great Depression, they're one of the generally disregarded products of the Columbian Exchange - there are some varieties of dandelion or closely related plants native to North America, but the ones you'd generally recognise are Old World imports. It's not clear whether they were intentionally imported or not, but given their seeding habits, the chances are good that they were accidental. They grow *anywhere*, and can be incredibly destructive plants when they push up through paving or have their roots crack through walls.  They're regarded as a food or medicinal plant through recorded history, though never as a particularly desirable one. Abū Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī, known in the west as Rhazes, wrote about them around 900CE, but only as a medicinal plant, and Avicenna (Ibn Sina) reputedly devoted an entire chapter to them in one work a century later. As far as I can tell, though, they're not included by Al-Warraq in his cookery book in Baghdad, roughly contemporaneous with Ibn Sina (at least, I can't find any reference to them under the names I know, and the translator of the edition I have, Nawal Nasrallah, hasn't included them in the index of ingredients). They were almost certainly included in the range of green plants used by European medieval peasants in pottages, although, again, they're not actually included in any of the lists provided by Peter Brears in *Cooking and Dining in Medieval England*.  The Victorians seem to have made more use of the dandelion. E. Lewis Sturtevant, writing in 1886, notes it grown for the Boston market in 1836, and he says the seed is for sale in ""various seed catalogues of 1885"" in no less than 6 varieties. The first mention of dandelion as a vegetable he could find in England was 1846 in the Gardeners' Chronicle, where it's described as ""a beautiful and delicate blanched salad"". He also says ""[t]he influence of rich soil and protected growth upon the dandelion is to give increased size and succulence to the plant, and to thicken the branching of the leaves"", which is in line with most cultivated versions of wild plants. There was considerable interest in the Victorian era in new and exotic vegetables, much as there is now, and if they could be got by cultivating wild plants, so much the better.  However, dandelions, once grown, can be very hard to remove from a given location. The taproot - which is edible too - can go down a metre without much difficulty, and unless it's pulled out entirely, the plant will regrow from it. This is a feature if you're harvesting it, since it'll reappear within weeks, but if you're trying to clear it from a bed to make way for something else, it's a pain. This is probably one of the two reasons that it's not really grown for food anymore - the other being that it's not terribly good. Arugula, or rocket, is generally better tasting than the leaf. The flowers *can* be made into a hedgerow wine, but you generally need to add other things (lemons, for example) to get anything that tastes palatable. The root can be dried, roasted, and ground to make a drink that is claimed to be like coffee, presumably by people who have never had coffee - but actual coffee, or even chicory, is better. And so forth. By 1911, the Britannica says, somewhat delicately, ""[f]or the purposes formerly recognized taraxacum is now never used"". In addition, the difference between the cultivated and the wild dandelion isn't really enough to merit growing it deliberately.  They're not the only vegetable to disappear from modern use through inconvenience - there's one called skirrets, which resembles carrots and parsnips, but has a bunch of longer, thinner roots, which are obviously more difficult to peel and cook than their fatter cousins, so they've been left behind. Likewise, alexanders, a leafy green, is more bitter and requires more cooking than celery, its closest modern equivalent, so it's been abandoned as well. I haven't eaten skirrits (yet), but I can assure you that alexanders taste like freshly cut hedgerow smells.  They're not _completely_ absent from modern cuisine, although they always seem to come with caveats. Harold McGee notes that it's 'occasionally grown on a small scale'. They're used in a traditional English soft drink called Dandelion & Burdock, which is still made (a brand called Fentimans is the one I know). There is a claim in various articles that a local variety called 'koproradiko' or 'mari' is eaten in Crete as a salad ingredient, or boiled, but it occurs in so many places with exactly the same phrasing that I suspect it's copied from a single source, and I can't find anything to back it up. They're eaten in Greece in general, though, as one of many plants under the label 'horta', and are known there as 'radikia'. 'Horta vrasta', which seems to be literally 'boiled greens' is possibly the most authentically historical way to eat them. Blanched leaves (grown under cover) are sometimes seen in salads in vegetarian restaurants here in Ireland, too, and they're occasionally used in French cuisine.  **Sources:**   E.

Wow, talk about a qualified response! Very interesting - thanks
"Very nicely done — I would just point out that the history of the American lawn (as you have referenced) is a fascinating and vast topic by itself. My wife (who is a PhD historian of science but teaches high school students at a very high-end private school) loves to introduce this topic into courses on the history of the environment, because once you realize how weirdly classist and environmental _disastrous_ the American conception of a lawn is (to say nothing of its weirdness: this very unnatural patch of imported grass, kept at constant height and perfect monoculture, usually through intensive use of pesticides and herbicides as well as constant mechanized labor, often through the use of cheap but illegal labor in the US), it really blows their minds with regards to how many _other_ weird, destructive, totally bananas cultural practices we ""modern"" people adopt without thinking very deeply about.

Now you've got me curious about cheatgrass. Are you saying that generations of people have harvested it alongside wheat, unable to tell a difference in it? If they've harvested and replanted it thinking it to be wheat, it seems like they'd also have accidentally used it as food. How would a handful of cheatgrass mixed in with the wheat affect the quality of a loaf of bread?
"You won't get any argument from me on the strangeness (and ecological cost) of lawns. The water costs of American lawns are truly staggering. I and colleagues actually have a MS in review at the moment from a side project modeling the amount of water used (and wasted) in the US on lawns and how it affects streamflows.   Lawns do have a fascinating history: commoners used to have ""commons,"" while landed gentry had lawns. Now, everyone seems to want a bit of green lawn, and the commons in the classic sense have disappeared almost entirely. Closest we have in the US is National Forests and BLM lands. To me, I think I'd take village commons over a lawn any day :)"
"Cheatgrass has evolved with wheat in C. Asia since wheat was first cultivated. The name ""cheat grass"" derives from that: American farmers in the 19th C. thought the seed merchants had ""cheated"" them when they realized their planted fields were producing wheat *and* *B. tectorum*.   You can certainly tell the difference between the two plants. But especially since wheat has been bred to bear seed heads closer to the ground and at a uniform height (to facilitate mechanical harvesting), cheatgrass has been unintentionally selected for the same traits (because the plants producing seed at the same height and time got reaped, threshed, and re-planted together). So cheatgrass in the American West is quite common in and around winter wheat fields, in particular. It's also common in rangelands (the seeds get carried by livestock quite easily) that aren't cultivated, and you can often see the difference between ""crop associated"" cheat and range cheat.   I'm sure you've eaten cheat if you've eaten noodles (or maybe bread) made from winter wheat, and I doubt you'd know. It would be present in fairly small quantities (cheat isn't nearly as productive as cultivated wheat). You can, however, [drink cheatgrass beer if you're so inclined](https://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/7449/brewing-with-cheatgrass/).  See p. 35 of *Cheatgrass: Fire and Forage...* for more info on coevolution of cheatgrass and cereal crops (known as ""mimicry"" in weeds). You can also find scientific lit under ""preadaptation"" of *B. tectorum*.  Young, J. A., & Clements, C. D. (2009). Cheatgrass: fire and forage on the range. University of Nevada Press."
"I surely can! Some of this is from personal experience, and some of it I learned while teaching (and sharing stories with primary sources and students from the region).   History and reading on the subject: Native peoples still live in the southern Appalachians (Iroquoian speaking tribes like the Cherokee, the Muskogean speaking Creek, Shawnee, Catawba, and lesser known tribes such as the Monacan tribe of Virginia) and some of the foraging which was traditional in those cultures persists. European and African American immigrants often lived in close proximity to native communities in southern Appalachia during the 17th-19th centuries, and there are shared traditions and practices in some cases.   Before the railroads and coal mines transformed the landscape (and economy) after the Civil War, most people (of all ethnicity and cultures) were subsistence farmers, hunters, or woodspeople. Foraging was certainly part of that culture, and continues to some extent today (as can be seen in ramp festivals and other such institutions).   Yarnell, S. L. (1998). The southern Appalachians: a history of the landscape (Vol. 18). Diane Publishing.  Davis, D. E. (2011). Where there are mountains: an environmental history of the southern Appalachians. University of Georgia Press.  **Personal experience**: One of my great-grandfather's was what would today be called a subsistence farmer in Buchanan Co., VA. He cut wood, had dairy cows (so we had our own milk and butter), and famously went to ""the big city"" of Tazewell, VA a couple times a year for the two ""necessities"" he couldn't provide himself: coffee and salt. He, my great-grandmother (who was Native American), and most of us great-grandchildren would regularly forage for food in the forest: poke, ramps, morels, blackberries, huckleberries, juneberries (*Amelanchier* spp.), wintergreen berries, persimmons, pawpaw (*Asimina triloba*), spicebush, and various nuts were the most common of the plants.  Our favorite foraged meal was of Morels and perch roe scrambled with chicken eggs. Every spring and still probably my favorite meal. Perch are anadromous, but don't make it to the Appalachians any longer. We'd travel down to fish for them around Richmond, VA when they were coming up the rivers in the spring."

Well, it's a contaminant. Farmers (and noodle or bread makers) want a pure product and pure seed. Realistically, that is pretty rare. And yes, the yield is the primary issue for a farmer: cheatgrass produces a lot of seed, but it is not nearly as prolific (by weight) as winter wheat. Usually when buying seed (or commodity wheat) it will be certified to a certain degree of purity by weight.   The USDA has guidelines for minimum purity standards for almost all commodity sales or imports, and then different grades can have higher standards yet. Which makes sense: while cheat seed and wheat seed are both grass propagules, the *intentionally* cultivated crops have been bred for specific qualities (fiber and protein percentages, moisture content, ease of hulling, etc.). Cheat has only been *unintentionally* selected for being a good infiltrator of wheat fields.

I wouldn't be surprised if there are more swimming events that Phelps competes in than ancient events as a whole. There were three fighting events: boxing, wrestling, and pankration (a combination of the two, maybe a bit like MMA). Two riding events: chariot and horeseracing. Four different running events (including the race in armor), and the pentathalon. So I think it is a *bit* unfair to Leonidas.  The one that comes to mind is Phayllos of Kroton, who leapt so far he cleared the pit and broke his leg. As the pit was about fifteen meters long, this is well beyond the 8.9 Mike Powell managed in Barcelona. That being said, the sheer size of this leap has made plenty of people a bit leery, and it does seem to be straining against the limits of the possible, and so there is a bit of a debate over what the long jump was actually like. One possibility is that the weighted [halteres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halteres_(ancient_Greece\)) that the athletes apparently held while jumping was used in some way to add lift or effect the center of gravity, but modern testing hasn't really provided a comparable effect. The simpler explanation is that it was just a triple jump, which makes 15 meters extremely impressive but well within the 18.3 meters that is the current record.  If you want to read more, Leuven has a great little site about the Olympics, I linked [Phyllos' page](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/tp018en.html).  EDIT: it is worth noting that event athletics became proffessionalized to an extent during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were enough places hosting games that it was possible for a talented athlete to make a comfortable living going from Games to Games and surviving off of the prize money. By contrast the competitors of the classical games were young aristocratic amateurs, so I find it pretty likely that the quality of competition was much higher in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but authors primarily primarily talked about the classical games.
Other questions: how accurate are the records of Leonidas of Rhodes winning? Could they have been exaggerated? Was it entirely fair (did other athletes let him win for some reason)?
Side question: Do many of the exact records in the ancient olympics still exist? For example: Leonidas ran X event in Y amount of time? And if so, how accurate would these records be?
Have researchers considered the possibility that he had help from Hermes?  Jokes aside, I didn't realize that the ancient Olympics had so few events. Were they always the same events every time or did they occasionally mix things up?
The sources on him are pretty scanty but the Greeks would erect monuments to victors inscribed with their victories, so it is likely that Pausanius, one of our sources for Leonidas, saw a monument honoring him. His account comes from a travel book describing the sights of Greece and he talks about Leonidas specifically in a section on Olympia ([6.13.4](http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias6A.html)).   As for fairness it would be crazy to think an athlete would blow the race. The Greeks took the Olympics (and the other panhellenic games) very seriously. They even had mechanisms for preventing false starts. Isthmia had a mechanism that held a rod at waist-height across all the runners and dropped the rod to start the race. If a runner was too eager, the rod would land on his foot.
There were no times taken in footraces or the horse races for that matter. It would have been impossible--what timekeeping device in antiquity could have been used like a stopwatch or was capable of measuring the second or millisecond differences that separate even relatively long, slow races (I guess slow depends on what you run--I was a 400 runner, so...)? Occasionally we're told of distances in jumps, but the official victors' lists do not seem to have kept records of jump distances. 
I should probably be clear that the Olympic events were not entirely fixed and there was probably some variation across time. That being said, the central aspect of the Olympic competitions was individual military quality. They tested martial excellence: for example the javelin throw and race in armor are pretty obvious, but also the long jump tested the ability to clear obstacles on the battlefield.  This means the Greeks would be quietly horrified that *archery* is an event.  EDIT: Worth noting the modern games also often have a martial origin. Dressage is pretty famous in this respect, but I'm currently watching the steeeplechase which strikes me as having a martial cast as well.
Oh this sounds cool.  Any other mechanisms?
> This means the Greeks would be quietly horrified that archery is an event.  Can you expand on that at all? I guess I never really thought about it, but now that I am thinking about it, I don't think of bows as being part of the Greek panoply. 
There's a bit of a historical misconception that the Greeks disparaged the use of bows and arrows in martial combat. In Book XI of Homer's Iliad, Diomedes is wounded by Paris's arrow and cries in response:  > Braggart, vainly boasting because you grazed my foot! Ah, pretty archer with curling hair and an eye for the girls. Face me man to man with real weapons and your bow and quiver will help you nothing. I no more note this scratch than if a woman, or a careless child had struck me. A weakling’s shaft, a nonentity’s proves blunt, while the spear from my hand, it if merely touches, bears witness to its sharpness, and floors its man. Then his wife’s cheeks are scarred by grief, and his children are fatherless, while he, staining the earth with blood, rots with vultures not pretty girls at his side. (XI:384-396)  However, recent scholarship suggests that archery was not as uncommon in ancient Greece as previously believed. If you'd like to read more about this, there's a 2013 [dissertation](http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A160331) on it.
"Also in Homer, you have Teucer, a minor Greek hero in the Iliad, and Odysseus  using bows and not portrayed as particularly cowardly or effeminate. I wonder if the supposed anti-archery of the Greeks isn't a case of scholars overstating things a bit, similar to the much-ballyhooed ""dishonorable"" nature of missile weapons in medieval Europe (that doesn't really exist). "
"> To be entirely honest I'm not sure what sort of ancient evidence exists to support that attitude  Not much, as it happens! I've written about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/45fclk/how_likely_was_it_for_skirmishers_to_survive/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/477gbp/was_ranged_combat_slings_archery_etc_seen_as_less/d0b4jjn).   In the Archaic period it is clear that archery is regarded as just another way to fight, if one that can generate a lot of frustration among those who fight up close. It was neither a poor man's weapon nor one that characterised barbarians. In addition to the Homeric evidence, there are many depictions on vases of Greeks in heavy armour wielding bows.  In the Classical period, things have changed a lot. Greeks now like to characterise themselves as melee infantry, and stereotype foreigners as missile troops. They've also created a clear distinction between the ""good"" (rich), who fight as hoplites or cavalry, and the ""bad"" (poor), who fight as light infantry or as rowers in the fleet. These two sets of opposites make the bow a more widely derided weapon. Even so, its effectiveness in combat is never disparaged. There is a passage from Euripides (*Herakles* 155-164) that is often used to prove Greek disdain for archers:  > A man who has won a reputation for valor in his contests with beasts, in all else a weakling; who never carried a shield nor faced a spear, but with a bow, that coward's weapon, was ever ready to run away. Archery is no test of manly bravery; no! he is a man who keeps his post in the ranks and steadily faces the swift wound the spear may plough.   But in fact this tirade is immediately followed by the counter-argument (188-203):   > Next you disparage that clever invention, an archer's weapon; come, listen to me and learn wisdom. A man who fights in line is a slave to his weapons, and if his comrades lack courage he is slain himself through the cowardice of his neighbours, or, if he breaks his spear, he cannot defend his body from death, having only one means of defence; whereas all who are armed with the trusty bow, though they have but one weapon, yet is it the best; for a man, after discharging countless arrows, still has others with which to defend himself from death, and standing at a distance keeps off the enemy, wounding them for all their watchfulness with invisible shafts, and never exposing himself to the foe, but keeping under cover; and this is by far the wisest course in battle, to harm the enemy and keep safe oneself, independent of chance.   Indeed, since it is very hard to learn how to use a bow effectively, there was a degree to which this weapon was exempt from stereotyping as a poor man's weapon. Xenophon in the *Education of Cyrus* (2.1.16-17) claims that the general use of missile weapons puts the poor at a disadvantage, since only the rich have the leisure time to train and master them:  > Now, up to this time you have been bowmen and javelin throwers, and so have we; and if you were not quite our equals in the use of these arms, there is nothing surprising about that; for you had not the leisure to practise with them that we had. But with this [close combat] equipment we shall have no advantage over you. In any case, every man will have a cuirass fitted to his breast, upon his left arm a shield, such as we have all been accustomed to carry, and in his right hand a sword with which, you see, we must strike those opposed to us at such close range that we need not fear to miss our aim when we strike. In this armour, then, how could any one of us have the advantage over another except in courage?  Since javelin throwing was still an Olympic event, the surprising thing is perhaps really that archery *wasn't.* There's plenty about the modern Olympics the ancient Greeks would find horrifying (women are allowed to watch! Women are allowed to *compete!*), but archery would probably be among the more easily accepted differences.  Edit: added the passages"

Actually, the events are not entirely unconnected. The tale tells that the band wrote the initial draft in the air, after having inhaled copious mind-altering volcanic fumes.

"I'm going to propose an alternate theory: the Eagles merely transcribed the existing Hotel California Song from their memories of the Song of Iluvatar, specifically the Second Theme.  As is told in the Ainulindalë, the Song that the Ainur created held all that was, is, and will be in Arda. In addition, as Rúmil of Tirion has noted, the Ainur went into Arda as the Valar and Maiar. Manwë was the greatest of the Valar, and to him were the Eagles dear. It is no great leap to assume that the Eagles heard much of the Song during their time with Manwë.  Gwaihir was the vassal of Thorondor, eldest of Eagles, and with his brother Landroval, an important figure in the history of the First Age. That he heard snippets of the Song from Manwë is surely incontestable, even in this darkened age.  So, when the Eagles went to Mordor to retrieve Frodo and Sam, they were already humming the music of ""Hotel California"". It merely took Don Henley to write down the lyrics and melody at a later date."
Please expand your answers.   Specifically, why do they almost always seem to not be able to win playoff games in the Post Season.   Sure, they have made it to the Superbowl twice, but they lost each of those games and really, the number of times they made the playoffs you would expect more from them.    Maybe the expected benefits that come with the power of flight are not as meaningfully for a productive pass attack as the uninitiated might expect.  
So basically the documentaries made by Peter Jackson are nothing more than fiction? I always thought he was a fairly well respected historian?
"An under appreciated fact of music history is that Desperado was in fact written about Aragorn. See lyrical analysis below:    ""Desperado, why don't you come to your senses? You been out ridin' fences for so long now. Oh, you're a hard one but I know that you got your reasons. These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow.""     - This is a reference to Aragorn during his time as the wandering ranger known as Strider. Aragorn was running from his heritage as the true heir to the Kingdom of Gondor. He has he reasons for being a loner, shame of his ancestor not destroying the Ring.    ""Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy She'll beat you if she's able. You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.""     - This appears to be a reference to Aragorn's romance with Eowyn, the queen of hearts. The queen of diamonds is likely the  beautiful Elven princess Arwen.    ""Now it seems to me, some fine things Have been laid upon your table. But you only want the ones that you can't get.""     - As heir to Gondor, Aragorn had access to many fine things in life. However, he eschewed a life of luxury in search of something seemingly unobtainable.    ""Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger  Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home and freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'. Your prison is walking through this world all alone.""     - Aragorn has a longer life span than most men, due to his Numenorean blood. He has been wandering for years as Strider, and he slowly realizes that Gondor may be where he belongs all along. Up until the Fellowship, Aragorn had been mostly alone. It wasn't until the Fellowship that he could grow into the man he was born to be.    ""Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?  The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine  It's hard to tell the night time from the day  You're losin' all your highs and lows. Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?""     - During his wanderings, everything in his life seemed to blend. He was fighting orcs and evil things, but to what end? Regardless of how many orcs he killed, there would still be more. Aragorn needed focus to his life and wanderings, which would later come with the Fellowship.    ""Desperado, why don't you come to your senses? Come down from your fences, open the gate It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you. You better let somebody love you, before it's too late.""     - Aragorn must return to the path he was born to walk. He must join the Fellowship. He must ensure that the Ring is destroyed, something his ancestor couldn't do. He must claim the throne of Gondor, before Sauron conquers all of Middle Earth.   "

It is pretty hilarious and awkward, isn't it?
Joke answers are not allo... erm. Let me rephrase. The joke answers we're allowing today on AskHistorians should be in-depth and seek to answer the OPs question inside what is possible for the universe they are seeking to interrogate. 
The accepted explanation seems to be their lack of a ground game, but I'll have to wait until I'm at home before I can give you a source.  
Peter Jackson has certainly done the field of Mediterranology a great service in freeing us from the rigid death-grip that the Tolkienian school had over the interpretation of the source material for so long. His expertise in Rock'n'Roll history is a bit lacking, though, which led to this minor inaccuracy.  
well not exactly: this is an *international* subreddit, and our April Fools theme kicked off as soon as it was April 1 anywhere - here's the [world clock right now](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/?sort=2)
People always say that about their lack of a ground game.   But remember when Glenn Frey rushed for 208 years in that game against Lez Zeppelin in '79.     And Zeppelin had the best defense in the league against the rush that season.     The previous week Zeppelin had bottled up Earl Campbell for only 28 yards.    Maybe the Eagles just need to learn how to make effective regular use of Frey in those situatons.
The problem with using Freys is that they are known for holding grudges and in turn this causes incredibly brutal and violent weddings.
"I am not a historian per se, but I am a teacher, so hopefully I can answer this question in a way that the mods will allow to remain. If not, forgive me.   Teachers in all states of the United States are required by law to teach certain standards (standards may vary). I'm based in the state of Texas and we are required to teach the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills in our classrooms. You can find a comprehensive list of those skills here: https://tea.texas.gov/index2.aspx?id=6148  To be more specific, you requested information regarding why students in elementary schools are taught that Columbus discovered the earth was round, Ben Franklin and electricity, etc. In short, they aren't. Here is the link to the TEKS for Grade Level 6: http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter113/ch113b.html  Columbus isn't a topic for 6th graders in Texas, but if you scroll down to section 4, topic B, you'll see that the only mention of Benjamin Franklin refers to his role in the American Revolution.   While I will admit that these requirements are simply a framework, there is also a system for teachers called the TEKS Resource System, which serves to clarify the TEKS for all Texas teachers. Some teachers will supplement lessons with the textbook, while others will use their own research conducted through college to decide which specific details they will teach.  It is worth nothing that these skills are updated and corrected over time, although I would have to assume that there was never a TEK that said, ""Teach that Columbus discovered the world was round,"" since that fact has been well-known for decades prior to your own experience.

"Hi, OP and readers,  Upon further review and reports from users, the mod team has elected to remove the major answer previously in this thread. Ultimately, it rested on the personal experience of one person and their friends, a violation of our rule about anecdotes. There is a *wealth* of research on teaching history/social studies in elementary and secondary education in the U.S.  Sources were requested out of this body of scholarship, but none were provided. If that changes (we've notified the user via PM in hopes that this will happen!), we'll review the post again in keeping with our standard practice.  It's especially important in this case because education and how-to-educate programs in the U.S. are so diverse and decentralized--one of the problems with ""fixing"" problems in history education has persistently been the reliance on one perspective at the policy level.  As a public history/outreach forum, AskHistorians is extremely invested in both the problems of history education and their proper solution. We hope you'll agree that a well-sourced, rigorous answer to this question is the best solution for all of us."
"Education in the US is a highly localized affair, and as a result making broad statements about what is happening in any area of classroom education is difficult. Still, we can look to the research on elementary education to help answer this question. The first issue is that elementary teachers spend on average 1 hour of instruction just dedicated to history (that is, not integrated with other subjects like English Language Arts). As a result, at best elementary students are treated to an incoherent vision of history; the lessons tend to be isolated to individual events taught without a broader context.   Complicating this further is that most elementary teachers will have taken only one college-level history course, usually a survey of US history. They will not have learned about historiography or the historical method nor studied any one topic in great depth. Thus when they get to their own classrooms, they lack a vision for the purpose of teaching history and often report lacking the confidence to teach historical topics. As a result, what they teach comes out of what they remember learning from their own elementary educations (Darling-Hammond calls this the ""apprenticeship of observation""). And what they likely remember learning are the myths of national histories (Washington and the cherry tree, Columbus discovered America, etc.).   Finally, these trends have been accelerated since 2001. With the passing of NCLB, a greater emphasis was put on success in standardized exams. In the NCLB framework, meeting proficiency in math and English language arts was what counted as ""success.""  And if it's not tested, it's not likely to be taught. I'll offer a personal example that exemplifies this trend: for four years I ran professional development around history education for elementary teachers in NY.  When NY decided to end the 5th grade Regents exam in history, principals immediately pulled their teachers from our program, a program they hitherto praised and were excited to send their teachers to.  We repurposed our program from ""Teaching NY and US History"" to ""Teaching Non-fiction Texts"" and our numbers went right back up. The Common Core is also a set of standards in math and English language arts, so these trends are likely to continue.  In summary: history in the elementary years is not prioritized by the educational bureaucracy, likely resulting in minimal history instruction (if at all). In addition, elementary teachers lack the requisite content knowledge and/or the confidence to spend a great deal of time on historical subjects. Thus when students get to the high school years they have likely learned a great deal of history at home, in movies, in video games, etc., much may not be reliably told.  Sources: Brophy, J. (1992).

"Focusing on the time period of your question and experience (late 1990's and early 2000's) and building off the fact that other comments have discussed the regional/local implications of differing standards.  Another comment mentioned specifically Virginia as their experience, and Virginia's Department of Education DOES have their past standards all posted in PDFS nicely organized on their website allowing us to make some direct comparisons of standards.    For reference [Here](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/index.shtml) is the main page for the Virginia SOL's.  On this page are the most recent, adopted in 2008, as well as links at the bottom to previous iterations from 2001 and 1995.  Reading through the different history standards for the various grade levels did show some changes in their treatment of ""legends"" and ""stories"" in teaching history.  [The 1995 Kindergarten Standards](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/previous_years/1995/history_socialstudies/history95k-12.pdf) have as their first history standard: >  The student will understand that history relates to events and people of other times and places by > •  identifying examples of past events in legends and historical accounts, including Paul Revere’s ride and the  stories  of  Johnny  Appleseed,  Booker  T.  Washington, and Betsy Ross; > •  identifying  examples  of  interesting  Americans through exposure to biographies of important people of the past, including George Washington, Harriet Tubman, Abraham Lincoln, and Davy Crocket  By 2001 [The standards](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/complete/stds_history.pdf) was edited to read: > The student will recognize that history describes events and people of other times and places by  > a) identifying examples of past events in legends, stories, and historical accounts of  Pocahontas, George Washington, Betsy Ross, and Abraham Lincoln  And [The current version](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/next_version/stds_all_history.pdf) has: > The student will recognize that history describes events and people of other times and places by  > a)   identifying examples of past events in legends, stories, and historical accounts of Powhatan,  Pocahontas, George Washington, Betsy Ross, and Abraham Lincoln;   Looking at the three versions we can see a clear shift in the 2001 standard removing what are considered the ""popular myths"" portion.  It is important to note that the two updated versions do still use the phrase ""legends, stories, and historical accounts"", which leaves a large room for error in the students not fully understanding the difference in the three.  The Virginia Department of Education also publishes a series of lesson plans for each of the grade level standards.    In [The lesson plans for the standards US History Up to 1865](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/scope_sequence/history_socialscience_scope_sequence/2008/scopeseq_histsoc_ushist_to1865.pdf) there is a lesson (page 87 of the pdf) that covers the contributions of Thomas Paine and Patrick Henry. The [corresponding standard](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/next_version/stds_ushistory_to1865.pdf) is: > c)   describing key events and the roles of key individuals in the American Revolution, with emphasis on George Washington, Benjamin Franklin,Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry;   In this lesson the students are given links to an excerpt of *Common Sense* and a transcript of Patrick Henry's ""Give Me Liberty"" speech.  They are then instructed: >3.Have students read the excerpts individually or aloud as a class. If some of the language is difficult for students to understand, have them look up unfamiliar vocabulary. After they have completed the readings, help them identify the main ideas, and have them complete their guided reading outlines. > 4.Have students use the information from the readings and from the textbook to write a persuasive editorial for the local newspaper explaining why colonists should support the battle for independence. Show students examples of present-day editorials from the local paper to help them understand the format and purpose of an editorial.  As a lesson on its own there is nothing overtly wrong with this; however, if we compare this to a similar lesson published by the [University of Texas](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/coretexts/_files/resources/1775%20Give%20Me%20Liberty%20discussion.pdf) we can see that UT included in their lesson the statement: >The speech you read was not recorded in contemporary sources, but was instead recounted from  memory and reported to William Wirt (who was writing Henry’s biography) many years later in 1816.  Does the fact that Henry may not have actually said the famous words attributed to him “Give me liberty...” change the significance of this speech?  How does historical evidence change the impression we get of those who were the heroes of the American Founding?  Is it possible for the speech to be important even if we are not certain that it is accurate?  Why or why not?  The UT lesson includes an exploration into the possibility that the speech is apocryphal while the Virginia one does not; leading to students exploring the same idea with different levels of understanding.  If you explore the lesson plans for the lower grade level's on the Virginia DOE page many of the kindergarten lessons that accompany the standard listed above call on the teacher to find a text to read to their students that covers the event or person being discussed. As another comment already pointed out; most of the people teaching at these grade levels will not have taken many higher level history courses and may choose texts that perpetuate the myths without the teacher themselves realizing the inaccuracies.    This issue is added to by the fact that in 2010 the Washington Post [published an article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/29/AR2010122903028.html) covering historical inaccuracies in textbooks being used in Virginia classrooms.  The texts and publisher being discussed in that article were (and still are) on the [approved textbook list](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/textbooks/history_social_science/index.shtml) published by the DOE.  The state is currently going through a new revision of textbooks but still on that site you can see that the books being discussed had to be updated to a second edition and re-approved (their works being approved in 2011) while all the other texts for the Virginia History and History to 1865 section were not put through the same process and still have their approvals from 2009.  So as a TLDR;  * Standards from when you went to school may have included such myths * The lessons your teachers used may have omitted the historical complexity and/or possibility of the story being inaccurate * The texts that your teachers used may have had incorrect information printed in them that your teacher was not educationally equipped to catch.  Also a big shout out to the Virginia Department of Education for putting all their standards in such an easy to navigate and locate website.  I tried Texas first to look at the transition from the TEAMS test to TAAS and then TAKS and STAAR but couldn't find anything like what the Virginia DOE has on the Texas DOE website. "
"I'm glad that in Texas students are not taught inaccurate or incomplete information regarding history, but in other states, this may not be the case. I can only speak for my state of Virginia by looking at the [Curriculum Framework](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/index.shtml) for our standards (Virginia Standards of Learning.) Kindergartners are to be taught that Betsy Ross is ""believed"" to have created the American Flag. First graders are required to be taught about Franklin's kite experiment, that Lincoln was born in a log cabin (as if this was a unique set of circumstances in his time), and that Columbus is ""credited"" with having discovered America. The inaccuracies get better as the children get older, but the ""Virginia Studies"" course lacks so much context, it is practically pointless. "
I would definitely believe that the Columbus thing in particular isn’t actually part of formal teaching standards.   Since a lot of people have latched onto this example, however, and it’s a particularly egregious historical falsehood, I will say that I have a distinct memory of reading something in elementary school (in TN) about how Columbus’ own men during the expedition were afraid they were about reach the edge of the world and fall off; it was only when they started seeing ocean debris from a nearby landmass that they began to lose that fear.  I admittedly don’t remember the context in which this story was presented, so I can’t say for sure that it was intended to serve as a factual account. It’s certainly the sort of thing that makes me wonder, though...  EDIT: judging from [this article](http://www.history.com/news/christopher-columbus-never-set-out-to-prove-the-earth-was-round), I may have been reading an excerpt from Washington Irving’s fictionalized biography of Columbus, which is largely credited with spreading the myth in the first place.  EDIT 2: corrected spelling
"Ok, so let me preface this by saying that finding out something meaningful about what exactly transpired if all we have to go by are pictures is really, really difficult. Like with a single document, if we have nothing else, knowing what is going on is just... hard.  The only kind of information out there concerning these pictures specifically are a bunch of forum posts, which claim these show a US Army entertainment event but nothing about when they were taken, where they were taken, and what exactly this is. What seems to hold up going by the pictures is that the men shown in uniform are wearing US army uniforms that were issued during WWII and the Korean War.  While I was unable to find pertinent scholarship specifically concerning the culture of sexual entertainment in Korea while in the field, M. McLelland's *Love, Sex, and Democracy in Japan during the American Occupation*, Sarah Kovner's *Occupying Power: Sex Workers and Servicemen in Postwar Japan*, and Rachel Shteir's *Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show* all make extensive mention that both during WWII, especially on the Philippines as well as in occupied Japan, the live sex show had established itself as common form of entertainment for American service men stationed there. While the general history of the live sex show is more /u/AnnalsPornographie 's department than my own, Kovner writes that despite a lack of official reports, the sex trade and sexual entertainment flourished where American service men were present, especially since in a war torn country such as Japan, women who found themselves in desperate economic situations found that what they could sell the economically powerful occupiers was sex and there were masses of American servicemen who were after short term sexual encounters and willing to exploit the economic and power imbalances an occupation creates to get what they wanted in that regard.  The live shows differ a bit from this. As McLelland describes:  > Beginning in 1947, a number of small theaters in Tokyo began to advertise ""picture frame shows"" that featured scantily clad women posing on stage within wooden frames in imitation of famous nudes from Western Art. (...) Capitalizing on the demand for more graphic sexual entertainment some theater owners began to offer mixed programs that interspersed short ""birth control films"" with live striptease  He further describes how these shows tended to become more explicit over time and developed into a form of exoticized sexual entertainment where in an almost theater-like play that took into account the various racial prejudices of American Service Men in Japan, they often embraced narratives of Japanese men failing to perform when an actor dressed as a white man would appear to perform sexual acts with the women on stage to their seeming pleasure while the ""Japanese men"" character was forced to walk off stage or watch in shame. These shows were not just sexual entertainment, they played to the fantasy of Americans in Japan also having defeated the enemy sexually.  What neither of these sources mention is sex shows involving white women. Shteir and McLelland go into detail about the culture of fascination with the ""submissiveness"" of Japanese women among American service members while Kovner mentions that there were indeed a small number of white women (she counts 13, two of them French and having gone there after the end of Japanese occupation of French Indochina) working as sex worker in occupied Japan because of how coveted their service was among US service men.  It is likely that these photos depict a live sex show that took place somewhere occupied or in the field since it is unlikely such a thing would be condoned in the States at the time. But where exactly, what the exact context is, and who the women are is, I think, impossible to find out wihtout some really really deep research. Suffice to say that live sex shows were a popular entertainment for American Service men both in and after WWII and during the Korea war.  Edited to add:  It is of course, as someone pointed out in a pm, entirely possible that this takes place in the European theater of WWII. The reason I chose to focus on the Pacific Theater and the occupation of Japan, was a.) due to the possibility that this takes place during the Korean War and b.) because the sexual politics of occupation by the US Army are much better researched for Japan than they are for the European theater. Only recently have two books appeared, one dealing with the subject explicitly, one dealing with it as part of a larger narrative of occupation and I simply do not have access to them yet.  Broadly speaking, while sexual politics of occupation in Europe had less of a racist undercurrent than in Japan, it can reasonably be assumed that similar forms of entertainment (sans overtly racist displays) were popular among US Service Men during and after WWII.

I'll take advantage of this opportunity to talk about *why* answering OP's question is so damn hard.   Preserving photographs is great, but it's immensely frustrating unless you've got the *documentation* that goes along with it.  You've probably got a binder (digital or physical) of family photographs, right? You've probably got some on your phone, even.  As time goes by, people die. Memories fade. Photographs are taken from their context. A photograph you take might be passed on to your children, and they're not going to know anything about it. If you die, who's going to know that this is a photograph of you holding your first child, or of you [running away from the Boston Marathon bombing?](http://www.salon.com/2015/04/15/the_boston_marathon_and_reddit_when_the_internets_deluded_amateur_hour_detectives_ran_amok/) Unless you have *documentation* accompanying the photograph, something as simple as an inscription on the back of a physical copy, or caption data embedded in the image, that photograph isn't going to be useful.  Anyone who's dealt with family photos knows this, and so does anyone who's worked in a local historical society or small-town museum. I guarantee you that right now, in a dark closet or filing cabinet at your local museum, there's a vast collection of photos that no one knows what to do with because no one knows what the photograph is.   This is why **you must act.** Follow [the guidelines suggested by the Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/cataloging.html). Write names, dates and places on the backs of photographs (in pencil, lightly). Embed captions in your images and store them in secure, safe locations in the cloud or physically.   There's a vast amount of information awaiting future historians, but as we've seen here, information alone isn't useful. Information must be catalogued, sorted and made understandable, and the first step is documentation.
Thank you so much for this. It explains a lot about the practice and context. Even though I likely won't get the specific context of these photos, it is great to get the greater historical context of these sorts of situations.   On an unrelated note: for those PMing me about removed comments... I certainly don't see them before the mods approve/remove them. Stop asking.

Is there a good way to do this with digital photos?
"Frankly, I have little desire to further investigate these photos since what they depict is, when placed in the historical context of war and occupation, a public sex show intended to entertain men who compared to the women who ""entertain"" them are in immensely powerful positions; even up the literal power over life and death of these women. Thus what these pictures when contextualized depict is a sexual spectacle that if not outright forced, has strong implications of one party being forced to entertain another by performing sexual acts under at least indirect duress.  My process of initial identification boils down to the general uniforms of the men being US uniforms  of the WWII/Korea War era and the only person with some sort of insignia is [this man](http://imgur.com/a/H56hG) wearing a US officer cap of this era."
Let me preface this by saying that I am broadly aware with the discussion behind what you mention and that I, because I am only broadly aware of it and because I lack both expertise and experience in the area of contemporary sex work, feel that I am probably not the best person to comment on this.  That said, I believe the historical context of post-WWII occupation warrants the use of the term exploitation here because both in the question of both consent and exploitation, the general situation of an occupation tends to complicate these things. When we review the historical context of a liberating and occupying army coming to a territory, these issue becomes a bit difficult in that the relationship between two parties in such a situation is almost never equal (and both consent as well as the free, non-exploitative exchange of such things as sexual service is based on at least a base equality of parties involved).  On the one hand you have an army of men with weapons who replace law and order in whatever territory someone lives in. On the other hand you have a population that is in their interaction with the former group very much at the personal mercy of whatever armed member of an occupying army they encounter. Such a relationship is by its very definition unequal and thus the issue of both consent – which assumes adults of sound mind and of basically equal relationship to make an informed decision about whether they want to engage in intercourse – and exploitation – which for it to be not the case involves the exchange of goods and services based on their value in a broader frame that involves legal protection of both parties etc. – becomes muddled.  Consider, a women in a country that not only lost a lot of its men in a war but where public order has broken down and completely or partially replaced by an armed occupation is talked into intercourse by a member of the occupying army based on the impression he conveys to her that she needs a protector from other soldiers. Can we in such a relationship where one party holds the potential power over life and death of the other party, whether they use it consciously or subconsciously, assume that consent can even exist? Can this hypothetical woman even make a decision that is not based on implicit or explicit coercion by her hypothetical partner? Does this unequal relationship not imply exploitation, especially if there is no framework guaranteeing the legal and even physical security of one of the parties invovled?  Because of these questions, I think the use of the term is warranted and while they do have implications for a more contemporary discussion of sex work, I think this is neither the place nor I am the best person to have it with.

> Frankly, I have little desire to further investigate these photos since what they depict is, ..... a sexual spectacle that if not outright forced, has strong implications of one party being forced to entertain another by performing sexual acts under at least indirect duress.  Serious question: I have to assume, based on your title, that you have no hesitation when investigating the abuse, torture and murder of millions of prisoners during the Third Reich.  So why would the implication of sexual slavery be so distasteful by comparison?  It seems to me, based on your reasoning, that you're allowing your personal feelings to dictate which parts of history are more relevant than others.  Can you clarify your thoughts on that?
"> So why would the implication of sexual slavery be so distasteful by comparison?  It is not the implications of sexual slavery and sex work within a situation that is per definition unequal that I find distasteful in the context of this thread (though it is distateful per se). It is that this is not the topic that is seen and/or concentrated on when people inquire about these photos in this thread.  The vast interest that is present within this thread is geared towards an obsessive search for information like ""where exactly was this taken"" while the interest for what this actually shows beyond soldiers gawking at sex, including the historical experience of women who put on this and similar shows and engaged in sex work within the context of an occupation is for the largest parts just simply ignored. People see what these photos show – soldiers watching a sex show – but they seem not interested in what they actually show – a sexual spectacle put on the context of an extremely coercive situation.  In the end, where exactly this takes place is not the information of primary interest form a standpoint that is interested in gaining insight into the lives of the past – it's what the implications of the event shown are for the period in which they occur and for the people involved in them.   Like with the frequent questions inquiring about the blood, gore, and minutae of killing methods in the Holocaust, the distasteful part is that the interest is mere minutae, not the experience and implications behind them. "
> a rather crude form of entertainment solicited by American servicemen to satiate their sexual urges while deployed overseas  It's very likely that it is to them but whether they consciously deployed force is moot to a certain point because when we consider the perspective of the women involved, we need to consider how an occupation shapes the relationship between occupiers and occupied.  On the one hand you have an army of men with weapons who replace law and order in whatever territory someone lives in. On the other hand you have a population that is in their interaction with the former group very much at the personal mercy of whatever armed member of an occupying army they encounter and at the institutional mercy of an administration whose primary concern is not their safety and bodily security but that of the occupying army. Such a relationship is by its very definition unequal and thus the issue of both consent – which assumes adults of sound mind and of basically equal relationship to make an informed decision about whether they want to engage in intercourse or sexual entertainment becomes muddled.  That one party in such a relationship holds all the social, political, administrative and quite literal power in that they are the men with arms easily accessible creates an unequal relationship where it is not necessary to point a gun at someone to create a situation of duress – the knowledge that one party at any time can inflict bodily harm on the other, whereas the member of the army likely faces little to no consequences and the party on the other end of spectrum has little to no possibility for any sort of regress is enough to create a situation in which every inter-personal interaction – and especially those involving sex – carry enough of an implication of possible violence and retribution that duress of some form must be assumed. 
Let's talk how I arrive at this:  The photos contain only little information about the further context but there is one thing they strongly suggest: That this is taken somewhere in the field and not on a military base in the United States.  First, there is [the architecture present in the background](http://imgur.com/a/G5U84), which is significantly distinct from the architecture present [WWII Army Bases in the US](http://burnsfamilyhistory.com/NEW-PARTS/P09-WWII/Part09-Photos/FortLewis1943.jpg).  Second, there is the [soldiers' attire](http://imgur.com/a/34PG4), which is in a very casual state, especially given that [an officer](http://imgur.com/a/H56hG) is present at the occasion. From the general rules and conventions of military culture, we know that rules for discipline when it comes to soldier's dress are relaxed in the field while usually enforced on base, especially in the homeland.  Thirdly, in one photo one of the women is wearing [a plaid jacket](http://imgur.com/a/E21My). To assume based on that it is more likely that the women were not professional sex workers (because they are wearing what was considered every day clothes vs. clothing that would visually signal their status as sex workers to potential clients) would probably be going a step too far in assuming but it indicates that there were with a high possibility not flown in from the US to perform as sex show because – and here we enter already the context external to the source – when reading Rachel Shteir's *Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show* that shows of a titillating nature put on for US Service Men in the field embraced a glamor effect (think Marylin Monroe at the USO show) and the glamor sexiness of 1940s/50s shows would not just put women in street clothes on stage to get naked and get down.  This establishes that what we see here took place somewhere in the field, either in Korea or during World War 2 based on the uniforms and that the women in these pictures are with a great degree of certainty locals or at least not part of a sanctioned show.  And this takes us to the context of what that means that it takes place in the field: As I wrote below, the historical context of post-WWII occupation and liberation has implications for the relationship between the parties depicted in these images. When we review the historical context of a liberating and occupying army coming to a territory, these issue becomes a bit difficult in that the relationship between two parties in such a situation is almost never equal but rather based on a wider social frame that is decidedly unequal and based on force.  On the one hand you have an army of men with weapons who replace law and order in whatever territory someone lives in. On the other hand you have a population that is in their interaction with the former group very much at the personal mercy of whatever armed member of an occupying army they encounter and at the institutional mercy of an administration whose primary concern is not their safety and bodily security but that of the occupying army. Such a relationship is by its very definition unequal and thus the issue of both consent – which assumes adults of sound mind and of basically equal relationship to make an informed decision about whether they want to engage in intercourse or sexual entertainment becomes muddled.  Consider, a women in a country that not only lost a lot of its men in a war but where public order has broken down and completely or partially replaced by an armed occupation is talked into intercourse by a member of the occupying army based on the impression he conveys to her that she needs a protector from other soldiers. Can we in such a relationship where one party holds the potential power over life and death of the other party, whether they use it consciously or subconsciously, assume that consent can even exist? Can this hypothetical woman even make a decision that is not based on implicit or explicit coercion by her hypothetical partner? Does this unequal relationship not imply exploitation, especially if there is no framework guaranteeing the legal and even physical security of one of the parties involved?  A situation in which one party is able to inflict bodily harm readily on the other party with little or no impunity and consequences does carry strong undertones of duress, not necessarily because one part actively or even consciously plans to do so but because of the general framework involved, which includes that one party has weapons and force easily at hand and the other does not.  Because of these questions and implications, the above is not based on mere assumption but on the context from within and external to the sources.
I would argue that yes, the same applies in the context of colonial forces. Even more than an occupation, colonial and imperialist rule is what is best described as inequality in administrative form. A colonial and imperial situation in modernity is the assumed superiority of one party enshrined in a system of rule. There always is a colonizer and colonized, who by virtue of the basic structure are never on equal terms. This pervades both the legal frame of a colonial situation as well as personal interactions between colonizers and colonized. Not for naught has Hannah Arendt described European Imperialilsm as the precursor to WWII because the inequality that pervades the colonial situation as confined to the colonial space.
I understand your distaste for the average persons morbid/lurid curiosity, so at the very least I can appreciate why you find these sorts of discussions uncomfortable.  With that said, a historian should not bias their research based on their respective audience.  In fact, faced with such ignorance, one might argue that you have an even greater responsibility to help those casual readers become more enlightened.  Look at it as an opportunity to educate instead of a chore.  Unless of course you've already tried that approach and found it lacking.  But I can say with absolute certainty that you changed my perspective on the topic at hand.  What I saw as a relatively harmless consensual situation was revealed to be something very different which I would have never considered.  So before you give up on us, I would suggest that there are many people who could benefit from your insight.   
"I'm really happy to hear that what I wrote here gave you a new perspective and I do find that very rewarding.  To better clarify what I meant above is that I have little further desire to examine these pictures for the demanded minutae because the importance lies what they show within the broader context of their making. I'm perfectly willing to discuss this context what an occupation means for issues like consent and exploitation and what impact it has on sexual relations even down to the most interpersonal level. This, I think, I have also proven by the plethora of follow-up responses in this very thread.  What I am not willing to do any further is play to the demand that is only interested in the minute factual details and demands of me and any other potential expert to do nothing more than to deliver them only the information, they want without all the ""pesky"" context discussion, which – as so many have made abundantly clear to me in responses and pms that number in the 50s to 100s – they are not interested in reading, regard as bullshit, and don't want to get in the way of the satisfaction of their thirst for minutae, and generally hurl insults at me for daring to bring up the broader implications for what the depicted says about the women's experience in these photos when all they really want to know is where these was and which unit this was.  I'm more than happy and willing to take the time out of my day to explain both my reasoning, my conclusions, and my research and what I regard as historically pertinent factors in connection with these photos to anyone who is interested in that – in my free time and without compensation.  I apologize if this has turned into a rant and I hope it doesn't come off as harsh because that is not what I intended – as I said, I am really happy, you feel that you can take away something from this thread. What the point I want to make is that I believe to be very aware of my professional responsibilities, which – I also believe – I adhere to when it comes to the hobby of answering questions in this space. What I don't regard as part of my responsibilities is to cater to demands that reject the broader knowledge that is offered in favor of greater details of horror, gore etc. "
"It's well established now that Mr. Kennedy had a, if you will, *boatload* of health problems for which he was heavily medicated and used adaptive technology to counteract. Official health records and Mr. Kennedy's medical staff confirm this, in particular his debilitating back pain. Biographers have even described a power struggle among physicians treating the president over whether more exercise or continued painkiller injections was the better option for treatment. (Spoiler alert: physical therapy).  Likewise, Arthur Schlesinger's (relatively) recently released interviews with Mrs. Kennedy affirm that on Inauguration Day, she took Dexadrine between the inauguration ceremony and the evening ball to get through it.  So the question is really whether Mr. Kennedy's medical-treatment drug useage extended to ""drugs to lift you up for the event and bring you down gently afterwards"", and whether Mrs. Kennedy repeated her use of an amphetamine.  The difficulty for historians is that the attention here focuses on a shady celebrity doctor named Max Jacobson, who based his treatment program, reputation, and not coincidentally income on a cocktail drug injection based around amphetamines and painkiller. The vast majority of the evidence for Mr. Kennedy's ""off track betting"" use of drugs comes from Jacobson's unpublished biography; he (of course) destroyed his medical records. (And not just drugs adminstered by Jacobson--he tells one anecdote of Mrs. Kennedy discovering Demerol in their bathroom and her asking *him* to convince her husband not to take it). Furthermore, Jacobson was never on the White House medical staff and does not appear among counts of official entourages for various state visits abroad.  Journalist and professor Richard Reeves (*President Kennedy: Profile of Power*) seems to be one of the few writers on the Kennedys who has actually bothered to investigate the possible veracity of Jacobson's claim. Here is the evidence he gathered:  * The FBI file for Jacobson asserts that Mr. Kennedy was listed as one of his patients by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs * Jacobson visited the White House 30+ times from 1961-1962 (in late '62-'63, Mr. Kennedy's official medical staff headed by George Burkley cracked down on his more freewheeling medical treatment preferences, so the timing fits) * For a presidential trip to Vienna, Dr. and Mrs. Jacobson are listed in White House documents as booked into a room in the entourage hotel * A memo from Mrs. Kennedy's social secretary notes Dr. Max Jacobson coming to visit *her*--although I'll note that could easily refer to a discussion about her husband's health rather than her own (see the Demerol story above, for example)  The Kennedy presidency was incredibly carefully stage-managed, above all by Mrs. Kennedy herself. (Who was also no slouch in the political arena, recent historiography has begun to reveal.) Sealed records, destroyed records, stigma against people with disabilities, and the eternal popularity of conspiracy theories about/involving/by/against the Kennedys complicate our ability to get a crystal clear picture. However, the evidence suggests that there was a relationship between Jacobson and the Kennedys, and it seems a fair presumption that between Jacobson and Mr. Kennedy at least it was a doctor-patient one.  As to domestic violence, I can only say that (20 year rule applied) the historiography on spousal abuse and U.S. presidents/first ladies is *extremely* sparse. Almost unbelievably so. Rumors circulated that Grover Cleveland's ""boorish"" behavior extended to battery of his wife Frances; she went on public record denying them and affirming that their marriage was basically perfect. Rachel (Mrs. Andrew) Jackson survived an abusive marriage before marrying the future president. I caution that this is referring to physical abuse rather than verbal or emotional. No, I don't think that's the whole story even with the limitations, but scholarship on first ladies is still young and largely hagiographical/biographical. I suspect this is a ""stay tuned"" topic for the future."

That was a fantastic discussion on the topic.   When you say:   >more exercise or continued painkiller injections was the better option for treatment. (Spoiler alert: physical therapy)  Do you mean President Kennedy's medical staff decided on more physical therapy? Or are you opining that PT was the better medical option?   Do we know the specific type of injections that President Kennedy was treated with? I'm a doc myself and I've always heard about Kennedy having a historically bad back, Addison's Disease and other rumored conditions. But I've never actually looked into his specific medical history or the specific treatments provided to him and your answer has made me really curious about his individual medical profile/detailed case history.  edit: grammar 
Could you briefly explain the 20 year rule to someone who's never heard of  it before?
Nope, not my opinion--the medical records show Mr. Kennedy's back pain improving after Burkley and Kraus implemented a stricter PT core strengthening regimen. The two doctors also limited access to Mr. Kennedy of Dr. Janet Travell, who was providing the president with frequent (multiple times a day) painkiller injections.  Robert Dallek's discussion of this in *An Unfinished Life* is excellent reading, even if he cites nothing directly so you have to track down the info in other sources if you want to verify.
Oh, it's a subreddit policy--we don't allow questions about or discussions of events within the past 20 years. Two reasons: first, it takes historians some time to assess the causes, effects, and significance of a phenomenon or event; second, it prevents the devolution of a comment chain into a morass of modern political polemic. There is literally the rest of reddit for that. ;)
"The first and most important step is to get as close to the primary sources (interviews, records, diaries, letters, etc.) as possible. Ideally, this means having a full-text copy of the original--it's very easy for a misinterpretation, typo, or error to make its way into one secondary source that then gets picked up by later scholars citing the *scholarship* instead of going back to the original. In this particular case, it wasn't possible for me to, y'know, access FBI files remotely on a Friday night. So I looked through my secondary source collection on first ladies/White House culture and some biographies of President Kennedy to see which ones had hard citations to particular places in sources--that is, to a *specific* microfiche slide in a *specific* collection; to a specific page number in a specific published or archival source. (A lot of people just say something like, ""According to Burkley, Kraus brought up the next idea"".)  But as you say, primary sources also aren't necessarily objective and/or reliable. So it's important to look at: (1) who is the author or speaker, what their motives are, whether they *could* be telling the truth; (2) what is the nature (genre) of the source--a press release is a very different type of document than internal records, with different purposes, standards, and even patterns of language use.  In this case, you're absolutely right--there are *plenty* of anecdotes from people who knew Mr. Kennedy before and during the presidency of his supplemental use of drugs that speak of first- or secondhand gossip. It can be from an old friend claiming to have introduced Mr. Kennedy and Dr. Jacobson; or from Ruth Jacobson retelling stories she claimed to have heard from her husband. These are trickier. Strength in numbers is one good way to verify--account after account after account, especially if they refer to a variety of incidents, can give credence to a possibility/rumor. Researching whether the individual source *could* be right is another strategy--like what I showed Reeves doing above. And most importantly, information is power. Learning as much as you can about the source can help build a fuller picture of them, their motivations, and their patterns of writing or behavior.  I hope that helps a little!"
"Yes, I believe that's the policy of the *Crown* showrunners, and reveals one of the ethical sticky points of writing/producing historical drama about real people.  Now, there was a giant fleet of gossip magazines about ""Jackie"" in the years after her husband's assassination (that she absolutely hated), and of course all the later backlash against and efforts to reveal ""the dark heart of Camelot."" It's possible that there are rumors of domestic violence somewhere in there. But I suspect in the show, although I've not seen it, it's a bit of extrapolation from the idea of a ""troubled marriage under pressure.""  Again, though, ""first ladies"" is a developing body of historical research, and I'm definitely interested to see where it goes in terms of intimate life and relations."
So... only four more days until we can ask about the Lewinsky scandal.
For the sake of simplicity, all of the year is opened ip for questions on January first. So you can ask about 1998 to your heart's content.
It's worth restating just how small the combined budgets for the NEA and NEH are.   Arithmetic was never my strong suit, but I thought it'd be useful to quantify it against Trump's proposed border wall. How much of the wall will cutting these programs pay for?  **Projected cost of border wall (midrange estimate):** $15 Billion  **Approximate length of border:** 2 thousand miles  **Approximate cost per mile of border:** $7.5 Million  **Approximate NEA and NEH budgets combined:** $300 Million  **Length of wall built with NEA and NEH funds:** 40 miles: 2% of the overall border  Eliminating these programs isn't about wasteful government spending, it's an attack on our shared culture, intellectual curiosity and freedom of expression.
If you're making a call for NEA/NEH, please also take a moment to mention [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/news-events/news-releases/institute-museum-and-library-services-issues-statement-presidents-proposed) which is also on the block, and to be crude, odds are better you'll personally be impacted by it's loss more quickly than any of the other federal humanities funding. IMLS funding is of particular importance to rural libraries and Native American museums and libraries, and can sometimes be the bulk of funding at those libraries. But if you're a patron of smaller public library, your library probably only got the Internet because of an IMLS grant, because that was their largest grant impact during the 90s-00s. It's a quiet, effective and responsible distributor of tiny amounts of federal money, that have nevertheless had an out-sized impact on the quality of public library services available in America. 
For a very long time I would read posts and statements and calls to action like this and never have it truly cross the threshold of action in me. These past few months have changed that.  I'd encourage you, if you haven't made the calls to your senators and representatives, to do so. It wasn't easy the first time I did it. I took half an hour to walk out of my workplace, find a park bench, think about what I wanted to say, call, and say it. Then call again and say it again to my other senator.  Learn to flex this muscle. I make the call about once a week on whatever thing I feel passionately about. Then I reward myself by wearing a patriotic little pin that means something to me for the rest of the day.  If you really don't want to talk to a human being, you can call outside of business hours and leave a voice mail. It doesn't have to be long, and the line is specifically for people to express their opinions. So do it!  202-224-3121, follow the prompts to be directed to your elected officials.

Thanks for this, do you mind if I edit it into the original post? 
I am so glad to see this here. I work in a public library and I'm devastated to hear about the proposed cuts.
"I grew up in a predominantly Muslim country.  I go back to my country often, visiting my friends and relatives. Things have changed a lot. The Middle Eastern countries have invested a lot of money into the country. They also give out scholarships to young clerics to study in their country. When I was working in Saudi, I was friends with a lot of these students. What struck me was how different is their brand of Islam than mine. When these students finish their studies they will go back to my country and become the Imams and hold positions of importance in the government. And thus, this is how Saudi exports Wahabbism into more moderate countries. I've seen the result of this in the  ""Arabization"" of my home country.   Back to the subject, we used to watch Sesame Street and Bill Nye a lot when we were growing up. We also listened to a lot of NPR stations and recordings. And we weren't even in the States. Even in school, we were sometimes encouraged to watch Sesame Street. A lot of our local education tv programs were based on Sesame Street and PBS programs.  Americans should understand there are a lot of ways to fight radical extremism. One way is to export the idea of critical and scientific thinking. The PBS series made me appreciate science more. It made me understand that we live in a world with diverse cultures. The cost to maintain NEH and NEA is a lot less than spending on tanks and machine guns."
"I'm from Germany and I'd also like to state my support. Humanities sadly aren't that ""useable"" in business, that's why government subsidies are important to free historians, philosophers, linguists, etc. from budget constraints to help the public broaden their horizons. It's an invalueable service to everyone, I've also enjoyed NPR while visiting the US. It would be so sad to see it cut."

>[User deleted comment giving opinion that funding should not be through government, but private donations]  The issue is that this is unsustainable, and ignores what these funds do. A program like the NEH allows for distribution of funds to places which might not be able to survive on donations, *not* because they are worthless, but because they service regions where the population simply couldn't afford to donate much. While it is a slightly different program, I would point to the IMLS Grants that /u/caffareli mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df68dn8/) for an example of this.   In all honesty, there are instututions which could likely survive the loss of the NEH or NEA with barely any impact, but just because a university such as Harvard or a world famous museum such as the Field Museum in Chicago can perhaps make up the difference by drawing on their endowments to make up what it loses in Grants, and rely on the periodic donations of very wealthy alumni and donors, that doesn't mean that the local history museum in Smalltown, USA can do the same, nor can many small colleges and universities that lack deep financial pockets. There is, perhaps, an interesting discussion to be had on how to better maximize the impact of public funding in the arts and humanities, but that of course is a different discussion than whether should at all, period. And for the latter, it strikes me as missing what the funding does to suggest that it can be easily replaced by reliance on private donations. That path might leave unharmed, or at least only lightly impacted, certain institutions with deep pockets, but it would be an incredible diservice to many, many small ones doing good work for people who can't simply write a check if grants go away.  [See some examples I dig up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6kuws/)  ETA: User deleted their comment so added brief context.
If your position is that the Arts and Humanities should be privately funded, not publically, there have been several comments here explaining why that will often fall short. I would point to [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6j8bg/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6jv99/) especially. Public funding ensures that smaller operations are able to get money that they may be otherwise unable to secure in serving poorer and underprivileged areas where residents likely can't write a check to make up the loss of public funds, but would like to enjoy museums and other cultural experiences just as much as someone who can personally endow an institution.
You might not *personally* be getting grants from the NEH, but it is quite likely they are doing work in areas close to you. [Check out the list of grants here](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx). Location search is by state and Congressional district, so you can use that to find grants that have gone to places near you.
"Your closing seems to be undercut by your previous paragraph, but that is neither here nor there. The simple fact is that while you may think that the subreddit is ""for the historical truth and nothing else whatsoever"", well, it isn't. It is about creating a space for public history, and we believe passionately in that mission, not just here on reddit, but in general. We certainly aim to provide a place where people can come with their questions and learn, but that doesn't, and cannot, exist in a vacuum. As has been said elsewhere in this thread, many of the contributors to the subreddit were able to study, work, and in the end, share their knowledge with you, in part because of grants which came from the NEH, and countless more people out there working in museums, schools, and other places that historical knowledge is communicated to the public similarly benefited.   So simply put, if you enjoy this subreddit, then *you* are a beneficiary of the NEH. We are advocating for the continued health and success of the Humanities in the United States, because it impacts the health and success of the subreddit. You are more than welcome to disagree with whether or not there should be public funding for the Humanities, but if you believe that advocating for that is contrary to the purpose of this subreddit, you would be wrong. Increasing awareness and access to the humanities is the very core of what we are trying to do here."
That is, of course, your prerogative. But the two things I'd emphasize again are:   1) The NEH funding overwhelmingly goes to small programs. It's not feathering the nest of Harvard scholars (although I'm sure they get some grants) -- it's going to preserve local photo collections, collect and preserve endangered languages before they die out, help local museums deal with storage problems, preserve history of understudied and underserved populations. If you don't value history, of course the NEH may not matter much to you; but the idea is that we as a nation value our history and want it taught and preserved.   2) Cutting the NEH to balance the federal budget is the equivalent of balancing your household budget by cutting out a can of soda *once a year.* 
While you aren't alone here in your belief that this projects would be better funded through private donations instead of public ones, I would simply point you to several other comments, including [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6j8bg/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6jv99/) on why reliance on purely private funding is not feasible. You are welcome to your beliefs, but to be sure, from where we stand, you aren't saying that you are against public funding, but in essence arguing that the Arts and Humanities are a luxury that those who can't afford to support have no expectation of enjoying.
We would advocate for the NEH whether a Republican president or a Democratic president were advocating cutting it. The services it provides are invaluable, particularly to small communities -- everyone loves Burns' documentaries, but the NEH also supports programs at tribal colleges, HBCUs, cultural heritage collections and [in many other areas](https://www.neh.gov/grants), some of which wouldn't exist without that funding. We care about *history*, and making sure that it's both being done and is accessible to all people.   **Edited to add:** u/Georgy_K_Zhukov wrote up a small list of some of the [types of grants](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/60gpc3/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national/df6kuws/) that the NEH provides, which further illustrates this point.
It is of course your choice who and what you support politically.  If you are in support for this, feel free to entirely ignore this post altogether. But if you enjoy reading answers in this sub and are generally positively inclined to what we are doing here, you might want to reconsider your support in this particular issue.  What we provide you here for free is possible thanks to the experts who chose to share their knowledge. Many of these experts gained their knowledge and expertise thanks to projects funded by the NEH and others. So, everybody who reads stuff here profits indirectly from this comparatively tiny amount of funding for the humanities.
You can support a person's initiatives and still criticise some of their other initiatives. Or like/respect a person and still call them out when you think they're making a mistake.
You realize this call to action would be spurred whether it was a Democratic or Republica  president? And people have explained in this very thread why the proposed actions will ultimately be ineffective.
You should add sources in your emails to your representatives, just FYI. Numbers without direct sources can be more easily brushed aside. 
Sure! Corporation for Public Broadcasting is also at risk and of interest to Viewers Like Us in here, if you want to expand it even more. :) 
My fiance is a librarian, and is if it wasn't already hard enough for librarians to find work you get this.   She is so passionate about everyone having access to information. She brought it up on our first date and it sealed the deal for me. Librarians rule. 
Very, very true. This is about our collective, deep-seated belief that the Arts and Humanities can have a positive impact on everybody's life, and that public funding for them is a public good which must not be dispensed with. I can assure you that we would be making this call regardless of who was in the White House making this budget, although arranging a double-blind study to demonstrate that commitment might be more trouble than it is worth.
Honestly that's a waste of time if you're writing your Senator or Congressman.   Generally speaking, an intern or junior staffer will briefly scan constituent correspondence to figure out whether the author is pro-XYZ or anti-XYZ and then your contact information will be catalogued and they will send you a form letter targeted for each audience. So regardless of the persuasiveness of your letter, you are just being marked as being for/against the issue.
Staffer here- yep. I don't care if it's cited or not if I know the subject and have a form I mark you and form it. 
Piggybacking off this a bit, how long after his death was the autopsy performed? As that may well affect the coroner's observations. Imagine, for instance, if Charles II laid in state for a period of time after his death without any embalming (I don't know what the Spanish monarchy's customs were in this respect), that would give a decent amount of time for all those lovely bacteria inside of us to start going to town on his innards.   I think I remember, for instance, that (yes, this was a few centuries prior) William the Conqueror wasn't embalmed before his funeral procession and got tremendously bloated as a result, so I'm curious if that might be what happened to Charles II.
This is all great reading, but, sorry, I'm a bit lost.  I've read all 4 parts of your answer (which is fascinating and refreshing to read something about which someone has so much passion), but I don't see in your posts an answer to what I thought was OP's primary questions: why would a medical professional describe the heart in that way when know it *can't* be how it actually looked during the autopsy?  Not a drop of blood?  What's going on with that?  Even during the period in question, I would assume that an autopsy is still a professional process with the main purpose of gathering and transferring information about the patient (and medical knowledge more generally) so why does the doctor performing it describe huge exaggerations or make completely false claims (no blood?) and in such, I guess, *cheeky* terms?  The topics you explain are very interesting, but I'm not seeing the connection to the question.  I'm probably missing it, so I'm not saying it's not there.  I just don't see it.
You are correct -- even Morgagni didn't perform autopsies immediately. It would take over a century until immediate autopsy became standard in Western medicine.
"I can only give my perspective as a philosopher who has studied a lot of Foucault and his contemporaries (Agamben, for instance). Keep in mind I'm not a professional or some PhD genius, just some guy who studies philosophy.   Foucault isn't really interested in facts. Foucault is more interested in mechanistic understandings, as in the things that produce 'facts'. This means a lot his stuff is what people now a days would call postmodern or in super modern terms maybe even Marxist (thanks to relativism and Marxism becoming intrinsically linked in popular political lexicon). Of course, this butts heads with what some people refer to as history. Foucault fundamentally disagrees with people who think History is a discipline about historical facts, because Foucault doesn't 1) think there is any value in discussing historical facts because 2) there is nothing 'true' about a historical fact. That is to say Foucault argues that history is subjective, to an extent. I'm not saying he's going around saying that history doesn't exist or any sort of absurd conclusion like that. I am saying he would disagree with the notion that the historical fact reported is necessarily the historical fact as it occurred. I'll explain this further because it seems absurd.   For instance, take a look at /u/Bedsiderounds recap of Foucault's ""The Birth of the Clinic"". In Foucaldian terms the doctors are determining the result, to an extent, by bringing in their gaze. This is really expanded upon if you read the rest of Foucault because this notion is really the underpinning of all of his work--it's about power and apparatuses of power that shape every aspect of being. And it's clear to see in ""The Birth of the Clinic"" as a really defined, less abstract example of what he writes about in say, ""Discipline and Power"", although they are ostensibly talking about the same mechanism just in a different sense.   So he is controversial because there are people who read this and thinks its postmodern bullshit, doesn't make any sense, everything is relative and truth doesn't exist. But that isn't what Foucault is saying, it just seems like that is what he is saying when you get the overview (which I realize I am doing a horrible job at giving his nuanced and subtle view in this, the way I'm writing it makes it seem like that is what he says but I promise you it isn't) I think it's also important to note that really modern (I mean in the last 5-10 years) psychology, anthropology, sociology, and to a slightly lesser extent (more so because it reformed later than the others) economics really actually reinforces what Foucault is talking about. The problem with that in history, in particular, is it almost necessitates revisionist History, which you likely see the problem with in an historical sub.   Contrast that with what most people consider truth bearing in something of a Popperian sense (fallibility, empirical testability) and that is traditionally what most historians see as truth bearing. Though in my experience that is also rapidly changing in the academic sphere.   /u/Bedsiderounds mentioned Kuhn beside Foucault, which I think is a good compliment to understand the controversy. If anyone is familiar with Kuhn he moved on from Popper and offered paradigm shifts in his philosophy of science. Foucault is like the ultimate extension of Kuhn: okay, we know there are going to be these paradigm shifts, so it isn't important to know the facts, it is important to know the shift. It is more important to know the mechanism that makes the fact true, because the mechanism doesn't change but the fact does.   Again, disclaimer in that I'm just some guy.   Edit: I'll try to contextualize this a little better, even though I know I shouldn't because I have work to do. In history there is a lively debate about what, exactly 'history' is. Is it the history of states of affairs, of events, etc or is it the study of people? This is a huge point of contention within the discipline. Foucault would history as a study of people makes sense, but history as a study of events and the more ""objective"" things is patently absurd because the people reporting those things have these influences of power on them, colouring the way it is perceived and reported. So you can study the people reporting the events, but you can't really study the events themselves. Of course this is a simplification and dilution but I believe it to be the jist of the controversy. "
"> contemporaneous medical perspective probably played a large part in both the description and the interpretation  Are you saying the description may have been metaphorical in some way? Ie, those phrases meant something sensible in that day and age? If so, what real quality--in today's terms--of a head would have been described contemporaneously as ""full of water""? How small of a heart would have been plausibly described as the size of a peppercorn? Or was peppercorn somehow associated with some disease and/or curse? Could ""complete absence of blood"" be referring to some quality of the blood that changes as a result of putrefication? What the hell is this surgeon really talking about? "
This was one of the most fascinating and thorough answers of any thread I have randomly started reading on the front page.  Thank you for taking the time and I hope you get time to get the tree up!
Thank you very much! It was surprising to get a recap of Western pathology as an answer, and was much more comprehensive and fascinating than I thought.  The podcast looks really interesting as well; I'll listen to it after my finals are due!
"You are asking all the right questions!  First, I want to start with an anecdote from Foucault, literally in the preface of Birth of the Clinic. He describes a case from Pomme, who cured a woman with hysteria by making her take 10 to 12-hour baths daily for TEN months. The intent was to ""dessicate"" her nervous system and the ""heat that sustained"" by providing an appropriately warm and wet environment. At the end of this treatment, he was membranous tissues ""like pieces of damp parchment"" pass through her urine, including her right ureter. Her intestine too, peeled off like a tunic, and passed through her rectum. The same was true of her esophagus, trachea, and tongue -- all these dessicated nervous membranes passing from her body and curing the patient.  He then contrasts this with a description from Bayle, giving a detailed description of the arachnoid and dural space in a patient with meningoencephalitis, not fifty years later.  The question that Foucault asks is this -- what did Pomme actually see? Did he truly see a ""damp parchment"" essentially consisting of the woman's internal linings pass from the ureter, rectum, and mouth? I've taken care of some sick patients, and I've never seen anything like that. This is obvious an academic exercise, but I imagine had I examined this patient c1750, I would not have described it in this manner.  I think he starts with this example because it illustrates so very well what he spends a book describing -- that our medical perception fundamentally changes the language that we use to describe things. I think that's easy enough to agree on. More controversially, does a different medical perception actually affect what the doctor SEES?  So to get to your question -- I can attempt to answer them with my clinical gaze and a healthy amount of speculation. A ""head full of water"" could plausibly be hydrocephalus, especially if he had TB. TB makes a lot of pus, and can plug the cisterns (the primary reason TB meningitis can progress so rapidly).  How small can a heart get? Not THAT small, but a restrictive cardiomyopathy -- say, from a long-standing TB pericarditis -- can greatly  restrict the size of the heart (http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/cardiology/pericardial-disease/images/figure-3.jpg, warning, it's exactly what you think it is). A complete absence of blood likely more refers to exsanguination, perhaps through some sort of abdominal perforation (again, TB could explain this), with then a delay in autopsy. This is also consistent with the gangrenous bowel.  This is what my ""gaze"" sees when I see that description.  But -- and this is what I was going for with this massive post -- I don't think the answer is that pat. Ultimately, the answer of ""what did this doctor see"" is unanswerable, unless we possess a time machine. Which is why I think other data points -- especially in regards to his symptoms, and analyzing pedigrees and portraiture, is so helpful, since those are old data points that we can subject to a modern gaze.  Does that make sense?"
Thanks! And in case you were curious -- I did not get the tree up :)
"Gosh, what a great question! It's such a great question, in fact, that **there is no definitive answer to it.** (Maybe you can be the person who [trawls the Nixon tapes](http://nixontapes.org/) and finds the answer.)  Before I start the discussion, it might be worth pointing out something that you (well, maybe not *you* in particular /u/TrynnaFindaBalance, but *you* collectively, as in everyone reading this) might have overlooked.  What's obvious to us today, with the benefit of hindsight, was not clear to Nixon or anyone else in the United States in early 1972. We know the results, and so we have an artificial assurance that because things turned out they way they did, they *must* have turned out that way. Living in the moment is to live in uncertainty.  At the start of 1972, opinion polls showed Nixon and the various Democratic contenders in a close contest. [Sen. Edmund Muskie was considered a strong candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/31/archives/nixon-and-muskie-nearly-even-at-43-and-42-in-gallup-poll.html), and Nixon feared facing Alabama Gov. George Wallace (who was ultimately incapacitated in a May 1972 assassination attempt).   At the start of the year, when G. Gordon Liddy and Attorney General John Mitchell discussed the campaign to harass and sabotage the Democratic Party, Nixon's wide victory wasn't yet apparent. That would come later.  It's also important to remember that the June break-in — for which Gonzales, Barker, McCord, Martinez, and Sturgis became infamous — was only part of the campaign approved by Nixon's backers (including Liddy). That campaign also included wiretapping and other kinds of snooping. **Remember that Nixon himself may not have been aware of the exact activities: It was the coverup that got him in trouble.**  But that doesn't get to your key question: ""What were the burglars after?""  There are *a ton* of fun theories about this. The most popular theory is that Nixon believed that Democratic National Committee chairman Lawrence O'Brien had some dirt on a loan given by billionaire Howard Hughes (yes, of Spruce Goose and ""The Aviator"" fame) to Nixon in 1969. Some of that money, [according to reporting by ""60 Minutes,""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/) went to paying for frills at Nixon's Key Biscayne home.  [E. Howard Hunt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ex-spy-crafted-watergate-other-schemes/2012/05/31/gJQAh80uFV_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d90adae4247e), who hired the burglars, told the *Miami Herald* in 1997 that they were actually looking for ties between the Democratic National Committee and foreign governments. They were searching for evidence of foreign campaign contributions (something that might be familiar to Americans lately), which would make great dirt in the election that year.  “What we were looking for is the same thing every congressional committee is looking for today, which was evidence of illegal foreign contributions,” he told *Herald*. “That was the rationale for going in there. We’d heard rumors that both the Vietnamese and Fidel Castro were inserting funds illegally into the Democratic National Committee. And the idea was to look at the books, photograph them, in and out, and that’s it. It didn’t seem like such a deal to me. You know, I’d been doing that stuff for years, a ‘black-bag job’ into other embassies. But you know, I didn’t have skilled people.”  In 2001, [Liddy testified that the burglars weren't after anything political](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/us/g-gordon-liddy-gives-first-testimony-on-watergate-break-in.html): They were actually looking for photographs that put the wife of White House counsel John Dean into a call-girl ring.   Contemporaneous rumors held that the motive behind the burglary was to find evidence held by the Democrats that linked Nixon to various assassination attempts made by the United States against Fidel Castro. A lot of those rumors stemmed from the fact that the Watergate burglars had deep ties to anti-Castro plotters, and some Americans reveled in the idea that the nation's dirty tricks had come home to roost.  [Columnist George Will has an interesting theory](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/08/reason-watergate-george-will/) that ties the motive to events happening in the days surrounding the burglary. One year before the break-in, the *New York Times* began publishing the Pentagon Papers. Will has suggested that Nixon was worried that the Papers would expose Nixon's 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks related to the Vietnam War. Nixon's successful sabotage of those talks, revealed only in the past few years, violated the Logan Act of 1799.   Regardless of the motive, it seems likely that Nixon himself had no particular knowledge of the June break-in, but he did know broadly about a campaign of ""dirty tricks"" against the Democratic Party to hamper Democrats' efforts to fight him in 1972. And as I said before, it wasn't the break-in that ultimately forced Nixon to resign: It was the cover-up.   That's something worth remembering."

"Great answer, but don't you mean ""Nixon's 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks""?   Edit: from a purely subjective point of view, as someone who cut his political eye teeth on Watergate, it always struck me that Nixon was something like a protagonist from a Greek tragedy. It always seemed to me that his perception of the 1960 presidential race was that it was stolen from him by an aristocratic party boy who hadn't done a tenth of the work that Nixon had invested in his own climb to the top. And it seems to me that Nixon was determined that no election would ever be stolen from him again, and that he would win with a landslide not unlike LBJ's in 1964, securing a mandate that would make his second term better than the lackluster second term that often unfolds. In short, Nixon was fundamentally flawed and perhaps driven a bit nuts by 1960, and his presidency began and failed as a result of what was set in motion when he lost his first presidential bid. If I were to investigate the very good question of OP, that is where I would head, but these are more literary interpretations of the man and Watergate than the stuff of history."
This reply has been removed because it is [soapboxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22soapboxing.22_or_loaded_questions.) or [moralizing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_political_agendas_or_moralising) it has the effect of promoting an opinion on contemporary politics or social issues at the expense of historical integrity. There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through differing political lenses. However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.
"According to the proposed scenario, he went to the South Vietnamese and asked them to pull back from peace negotiations with the promise of something better during the Nixon administrations. That would place him in the position of acting as a private, unelected citizen who was negotiating on behalf of what he hoped would be his future administration.  Of course, the shit storm that would have occurred if information along these lines had surfaced would not begin or end with the Logan Act (which would have been largely ignored). Politically, the devastation of any proof that Nixon played such a role would have ended his presidency.   Keep in mind that nearly half the names on ""The Wall"" represent US deaths during the Nixon administration. He owns those deaths even thought he was campaigning in 1968 to have a ""secret plan to end the war.""   If it is true that Nixon worked with a foreign government to engineer his election, then his crimes are enormous. After all, what presidential candidate would conspire with a government that was clearly an enemy of the US so that he could become president? Such a president would need to be removed from office as quickly as possible. Right???  edited with a correction thanks to the astute /u/eisagi."
Follow up question: when the statue was being installed was there deliberate planning to let it patina or prevent the patina? And if there was, did they use any particular techniques to speed up/slow down the process? 
I have a question. Does a color photograph exist of the statues original copper color? 
"Best that I can find, there wasn't much call for this. A *little*, which I'll touch on, but it seems to have been quite muted. Even by the time that the statue had arrived in the US, it had shifted from the red-brown copper it had shown off in Paris to a pure brown as the patination had begun (Thanks to /u/ducatimechanic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8w6pie/the_statue_of_liberty_is_now_green_but_it_used_to/e1u0s6v/), this is a [guide](https://i.imgur.com/35o8587.gif) to visualize the change). It was fully expected that patination would occur, and for that matter, *important* that it would. Although Bartholdi apparently had hoped it would end up in a bronzed color, the statue staying its natural copper would be awful for it, structurally, and in restoration work that has happened, it has been important not to disturb the patina, because it is a layer of protection against the elements, which helps prevent further corrosion. Removing it, or worse, maintaining a continual cleaning schedule to prevent it at all, would just mean the copper would just continue to deteriorate away! This was of great concern in the '80s when a massive restoration effort was underway, especially when a cleaner being used on the interior seeped out and started to dissolve the patina in places, which workers had to quickly work to stop.   Checking through what literature I can find, the real issue concerning restoration has always been focused around who pays for it. The Statue of Liberty proved to be a somewhat awkward gift that left the US Government in a quandary, unsure quite what to do with it, and as such it fell into an administrative quagmire of competing jurisdictions. The National Lighthouse Board, the US Army, and the American Committee (the group which had fund-raised for the pedestal and operated ferries to visit), for various reasons, all had some level of responsibility, but also all insisted that the other groups were the ones who should be maintaining it. A 1890 bill was defeated in Congress that would have made is a public park maintained by the Federal government, and it wasn't until another decade had passed that Congress agreed to a small one time expenditure of $62,800, which was enough to do some interior painting and install the elevator, but hardly enough to anything more substantial, or long-lasting.   Now, to be sure, there was a good deal of public concern about this, and a number of newspapers, starting within a few years of the statue's arrival, decried this, but it doesn't seem to be about the color. As already noted, the patina plays an important role in preservation, and the only articles I could find from the time which makes reference to any calls to strip the patina are focused on explaining why it would be a bad idea! There were *some* people saying it should happen, but one author, writing in 1910, makes it fairly clear it was a proposal that was ignored:  >The patina is the rust on bronze, which, however, does not, like the rust on iron, corrode the metal. It is green in color, the exact shade depending on the amount of alloy used with the copper to form the bronze. It is formed by the statue gathering from the atmosphere carbon and sulpher, and in the formation of nitrate copper crystals on the surface.  >""In the case of the Statue of Liberty on Bedloe's Island"" said Mr. [Gutzon] Borglum, ""the continuous washing of the wain and the spray keeps it clean. I should have gone to Washington, if necessary, if the proposal to take away its patina had been likely to be adopted a year or so ago. People said then that it was eating into the metal, and that in certain placed the bronze was rent away. All I can say is, if there are any thin places they are the result of flaws in the original casting.""  So again, as this suggests, there was clearly *some people* calling for the patina to be stripped, but from the start, experts were making clear that it was not needed, and a bad idea. An earlier article, from 1903, is even further in praise of the green, noting that of burgeoning hue at that point:  >Kindly nature has been spinning for her a fine cobwebby outer raiment or verdanlique, deeper in one place, lighter in another. Snows and stinging hail, fogs and rainstorms have been gently removing the repulsive newness of her bronze and streaking cheek and uplifted arm, draperies and crown with tender shades or green such as the cleverest bronze rounders try to produce with chemicals on their new 'castings, but never quite succeed in simulating.  The author further warns against any voices which might ""*shriek wildly for scrubbing brush and Putz-powder""*, not just for the writer's aesthetic tastes, but also again for the protective covering the patina offers. The editorial also calls for the appointment of a 'keeper of public monuments', specifically to ensure ignorance doesn't result in the destruction of monuments, not just 'Lady Liberty', a position which seems to have at least somewhat come about by 1910, as that seems to be the role Gutzon Borglum was assisting in by then. Additionally, as before, this suggests the existence of those who desired a de-greening, but again that despite their existence, it was a call which experts pushed back against.  One related thing I did find, which I would also make mention of, was a call not for a stripping down to the natural copper color, but instead to paint it! An article in 1906 makes mention of such a proposal, and again the author instead favors the ""marvelous harmony of blended colors"" from the ""varying shades of light green, delicate white, and a subtle dash of yellow"" which by that point have almost entirely overtaken the bronzed hues. The proposal had been written up in several papers, but at least as presented in this article, but was clearly not in an advanced stage of planning. Capt. George Burnell, in command on the island for the War Department, mentioned to the author the ""bushels of letters"", almost all of which were aghast at the proposal - which additionally helps to point to the acceptance of the green quite quickly - and additionally talks to copper experts who find the idea not only unnecessary, but quite ludicrous. Unfortunately I was unable to find the original announcement, but it is certainly clear enough that it all came to naught.  Anyways though, to continue with this more general over view of restoration, during the Wilson Administration, a Public-Private partnership with the *World* newspaper saw another $30,000 from the government, but again, it was a one time expenditure, and this time for installing flood-lights. Lights which, lacking maintenance funds, had mostly ceased working by 1930.  This funding morass continued through the 1930s, when it finally was moved to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, as part of a larger push under the FDR administration, in step with the New Deal, to give 'Lady Liberty' her due as a symbol of the country. Unable to get the funds solely on its own, between 1937 and 1941 the NPS worked in conjunction with the PWA and WPA to give the statue its first real overhaul, a $1.5 million dollar makeover which involved clearing the entire island of buildings to start fresh, building a seawall, a new dock, walkways, and most importantly much needed maintenance of the internal iron structure - although not quite extensive enough - which was becoming quite rusted at points, thanks to the salty seawater surrounding it. Much was done, but of course the outbreak of war in late 1941 brought it to a halt. Work would resume again in 1946 to wrap up work unfinished in '41, but over the next decade or so, the real focus with funding was on the creation of an American Museum of Immigration, which would eventually open in 1972 after a long and fraught 'battle'.  By 1981, even the work done by the NPS decades earlier was showing its age, and spurred by an analysis by French architects, a renewed focus on a *thorough* overhaul of the statue, especially in light of the upcoming centennial, began to be planned, perhaps most famously with American Express donating a penny for every purchase made with their card to the endeavor, resulting in $1.7 million dollars. Closed to the public in 1984 for the work - and as noted above, careful not to disturb the green! - the work was completed in time for the ""Liberty Weekend"" centennial celebration in 1986, with President Reagan turning on the floodlights the night of July 3rd, and the statue officially reopened on the 5th.

"There was no specific planning for or against the patination of the copper. No measures were taken to either encourage or discourage the natural process. The copper skin of the statue is actually a fairly thin layer, about the thickness of two pennies, and it was left more or less untouched for the first hundred years or so of the statue's existence. Any effort to remove the patina would have disturbed the protective oxidation layer and eventually led the the thin copper sheets weathering away. The original copper did deteriorate over the years from water making its way into the statue and collecting in low points. This damage meant that several parts were so severely damaged that they needed to be replaced by the 1980s. The tip of her nose, the end of a hair curl, and the entire torch were replaced in a massive repair effort from 1984-1986.  Prior to that, there were various attempts over the years to seal the copper of the statue from the inside. These various efforts created a buildup of a variety of coatings, including bituminous sealants and many layers of paint. These remained intact until they were all removed during the 1980s restoration using a mixture of solvents and liquid nitrogen. As a result, the inside of the statue is now just the bare copper with the exception of the inside of her head, where the crown observation platform is. That area is painted because of ongoing vandalism concerns. It is repainted once a year on Christmas Eve to allow time for the paint to dry over Christmas Day, because that is the one day each year that the statue is closed.  The statue's skin does have many holes. Some are from missing rivets, some from water damage, and some others are intentional, to allow water to drain out and prevent it from collecting in low points. The holes are mostly small, but on bright days you can certainly see pinpricks of light coming into the statue, particularly as she narrows toward her shoulders and head.  All of this is not to say that people did not take notice of the greening of the statue and occasionally advocate for it to be ""restored,"" presumably by polishing or otherwise removing the patina. When asked about the patination, Bartholdi (the original sculptor) suggested that it could be gilded to prevent further discoloration. No effort to that effect was ever seriously considered as far as I know. The treatment of the statue during the 1980s restoration was a subject of major interest to people who care about historic structures. There were a number of papers written about the restoration techniques employed in the repair work and the project was a major subject of the annual meeting of the National Association of Corrosion Engineers. Several papers were written and presented at that conference and later combined into a book on the subject."
Kinda. Even though the first color photograph was produced by Thomas Sutton in 1861, it wasn't until the late 1890's that color photography was somewhat viable enough to be used by the public and not just an experimental technology.  The first non-colorized color photograph of Lady Liberty is [this one](https://i.imgur.com/69kaA7F.jpg), captured circa 1900 and depicting the statue during its color transition to the blue-green we see today. Although the oxidative process was already underway - it took only two decades for it to completely change the statue's color and by 1906 it was completely covered in verdigris - we can clearly see a hint of its original copper color in the photo.   Although no color photo of the Statue of Liberty without its patina exists, there's plenty of artistic renditions of how it would have looked at the time such as [this.](https://i.imgur.com/oI1z8xQ.jpg)  [Source](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Statue_of_Liberty)
[Here is an oil painting by Edward Moran from 1886](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/EdwardMoran-UnveilingTheStatueofLiberty1886Large.jpg). It shows a patina already developing, with apparently only the hand holding the torch still copper-colored. I'm not sure how this squares with other commenters' points about the patina developing later

Somewhat related question: why don't nations give each other awesome gifts like this more often? For example, if the statue of liberty was a gift from France to celebrate the alliance during the revolution, why didn't they give a even bigger alliance statue to England when they finally decided not to kill each other anymore? Why did America specifically get the statue? I can't really think of another giant symbolic gift like this this. It's 300' high! It's freakin' enormous! It's like giving someone a 30 story building...
>it had shifted from the red-brown copper it had shown off in Paris to a pure brown as the patination had begun.  https://i.imgur.com/35o8587.gif  For people wondering what that looks like.

They don’t replace missing rivets?
>  When asked about the patination, Bartholdi (the original sculptor) suggested that it could be gilded to prevent further discoloration.  A gold statue of liberty? Has that idea ever come up again? Do you know if it was suggested at the time of the 1980s restoration?
"I cannot answer your first question, but I can provide insights on the second.  The idea that America was built on multiculturalism appeared very early. By the 1780s, the term ""melting together"" was a widespread metaphor in use that was meant to positively portray incoming immigrants. Of course, America had just ousted a foreign power from their backs, so nationalism was running high.  Hamilton, an immigrant from  Nevis, argued vehemently against immigration, arguing that immigrants brought pro-monarchy and ethnic views that would undermine their new, fragile country. He also argued that America's bountiful resources and exploding population meant that America didn't need to rely on newcomers. From the Hamilton Papers,  Examination Number VIII, Jan 12th, 1802:  *In the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed. It appears from the last census, that we have increased about one third in ten years; after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security and settlement.*  At first, the two dominant parties of the time (Federalists and Democratic-Republicans) mostly agreed on keeping out immigrants. Thomas Jefferson wrote in his *Notes on the State of Virginia* in 1781 that foreigners would be anti-Democracy. However, by the turn of the 19th century, the Democratic-Republicans viewed pro-immigration policies as a great way to undermine the Federalists.  See, Hamilton and the Federalists were afraid of the French, who were at the time being led by Napoleon after the bloody French Revolution. Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans pursued pro-French policy—and more proactive foreign relations with other countries—which included immigration. Jefferson saw immigrants as future voters for the Democratic-Republican party. As with many of these social issues, divisions in public opinion came from the very top, so voters tended to side with their party's views. So pro-immigration stances tended to saturate more educated Democratic-Republicans. The election of 1800 was a particularly nasty affair, as the battle lines between both sides slung serious vitriol to get their candidates elected. John Adams, the Federalist incumbent, faced off a challenge against Jefferson. Adams was pro-class and cultural hierarchy, while Jefferson wanted to model the country's Democracy on the new post-revolution French model.  It should be pointed out that both Adams and Jefferson saw the 1800 election as a fight over America's soul—that the election would set in stone the standards for how America would treat the subject of immigration for the rest of time. Jefferson would later write: *The revolution of 1800... was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in its form.*  Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican allies would use the melting together metaphor extensively in their campaigning, making 1800 probably the biggest pivot on pro-immigrant sentiment for the general public as self-identified D-R party members adopted Jefferson's messages.  Finally, the D-R party wasn't free from bias, and fought internally (and extensively) over what type of immigration was considered acceptable by them:  *The meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. The debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted American society and on how immigrants should be approached. The melting pot was equated with either the acculturation of the total assimilation of European immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: 'Was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on Anglo-Protestants like Henry Ford and Woodrow Wilson, or was the idea instead that everyone, Mayflower descendants and Sicilians, Ashkenazi and Slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?* (Baofu, 21-22)  The term ""melting together,"" and other various close iterations of the same idea, was solidified in the public's vernacular as ""melting pot"" in 1908, when the play *The Melting Pot* by Israel Zangwill was released and became popular.

"Follow-up question: at the time of the American Revolution, was there a social distinction between *recent* immigrants to the colonies compared to those having been there much longer (say, descendants of early Virginia Company or Plymouth/Massachusetts Bay Colony settlers)? In other words, was there a distinction between ""locals"" and ""the British""?"
The answer to the question is very related to the follow up question from u/JustZisGuy. No, not all immigrants were the same, and there were lots of tension between immigrants from different countries, different times, different classes, and different religions.   America didn’t really start off as an Immigrant country. The first colonies that were formed at Virginia and Massachusetts were formed in 1607 and 1620 respectively. Given that the modern-day USA was born in 1776, that’s 156 years of life in the continent, and enough for your grandchildren to naturalize in any country by today’s standards. Even by 1770 when Massachusetts was declared under martial law instead of more lenient taxing, most of the colonial leaders hoped to “reconcile with the British Government” rather than declare independence. By this time, the colonists weren’t colonists or immigrants anymore, but the people who were born on the east coast who built this country from almost scratch, including all the good and bad things that has happened.   These original colonists didn’t come here for no reason at all though. Catholicism was restricting freedoms throughout Europe and some immigrants came to escape this religious persecution to practice Puritanism (This is a completely different subject that requires a different research). Most of them came as indentured servants, slaves for pay for a predetermined amount of time, because the price to sail was too steep. These servants ranged from white Europeans to black West Africans. By the time of the Civil War, there were a continuous influx of people from across the Atlantic to the states, which all came either as slaves or indentured servants from all walks of life.    All the way until the declaration of independence and the civil war, the US was known in the world as a place with “class mobility”, where you can work your way into the upper class and become rich and elite. The US promised freedom to practice your own religion, your own language. The colonial Pennsylvania is a good example of how it’s founder, William Penn envisioned a utopian society where diversity would beget tolerance.    Migration was a part of the colonial American life. Americans themselves migrated every 10 years to different colonies, including people like Bejamin Franklin, so up until the beginning of the 18th century, immigration was considered a part of American life, and even the naturalized born and raised Americans were migrating. As the number of people who came to America on their own slowly diminished, and the slaves and indentured workers were transported accordingly, the states delved into more important matters, like declaring independence and fighting for it, and the age of colonialism in North America came to an end as a baby nation with all the turmoils of making one arose in its stead, full of Protestant and Puritans who were promised liberty and riches, but received varying levels of these promises. These people were in a time where immigration didn’t have the connotations it had today. An immigrant was a self-made man who fought for what he wanted and didn’t take no for an answer. An immigrant was an opportunist, a hard worker, a strongman who took care of his family in the most ideal fashion.    Years of life in the states slowly eroded this image of the immigrant as the settlers settled, cities grew and the economy and jobs expanded. With the constitution came law, but not yet order. Americans owned and ran American properties, and new slaves and workers shipped across the Atlantic did the blue collar work.    This was the type of country the US was when the conditions across Europe worsened as the US’s economy grew. Shipment of people to the states were around 60000 for more than 50 years until the famine in Ireland and political turmoil in Germany, which boosted these numbers dramatically. In 1851, there were 380000 people in the US ports of entry, a very dramatic increase in the consistent influx of humans. 2.7 million new prospective citizens entered the country in the next 7 years, and most of these people were Catholic in a time where Catholicism was hated in the US. There were stark opposition to Catholic churches and schools, but these immigrants had bigger problems. They drew hostility because of the diseases they brought with them from the old world. They were poor, just like the original immigrants but instead of improving the forests of Massachusetts into a sprawling city, they diminished its features with the slum housing they stayed in, the increase in crime rates, alcoholism and other misdemeanors. The American-Born protestants thought their English heritage was true Americanism and despised the Irish and the German. These people were called “nativists”, who believed opposition to the Catholics was necessary to protect America. The Know-Nothings, a political organization that was created by these nativists managed to become the second most powerful political organization in the nation, electing 5 senators and 43 representatives. After the civil war, nativist activity declined dramatically.   So to finally answer your question, anti-immigration sentiment arose from immigrants themselves because they viewed new immigrants as fundamentally different from themselves or their families. America undoubtedly was a melting pot, but this did not exclude people from making the distinction between cultures. Blacks were slaves, Irish were poor, Brits were true Americans etc. and anti-immigration is a very broad term for everyone who came to the US. Immigrants were slaves, immigrants were cheap labor, immigrants were Catholics, Immigrants were nation builders, and different groups had different expectations from these immigrants. Given all of these distinctions, it isn’t inherently illogical to say that immigrants are anti-immigration without including themselves. It is important to realize that actions have different consequences in different contexts, and some immigration is inherently more useful than others.   America, for most people, is the melting pot of the “correct” cultures.  _________________________________________________________________________________________________________    Just as an extra, here are some examples of anti-immigration that happened in the US throughout its history:   “Yet as industrial revolution transformed the United States in the postwar years and attracted a vast new influx of immigrants, the antialien animus rose again. In the 1870s more than 2.7 million newcomers arrived at U.S. ports.”   “more than eighty thousand immigrants from China arrived between 1870 and 1875, brought to America by companies that had contracted to supply cheap labor to mines, railways, and other enterprises needing unskilled labor. With 30 percent of California’s workforce unemployed following the panic of 1873, many workers attacked these newcomers as “coolies” willing to work for slave wages. Outbreaks of violence against the Chinese spread throughout the West, from Los Angeles to Seattle to Denver. In 1882, Congress responded to anti-Asian nativism with the Chinese Exclusion Act, which suspended immigration from China for ten years.”   “A striking number of new nativist fraternal groups were formed, the most important being the American Protective Association (APA). Founded in Iowa in 1887, the APA had attracted a membership of 500,000 by 1895.”   “By the end of the nineteenth century, the APA had disappeared. Nativist activism did not flourish in the first decades of the twentieth century, the years of the Progressive Era. It rose again in the form of the post-World War I Red Scare in 1919, and in the powerful but short-lived Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. It was in the nineteenth century that antialien movements had their greatest impact in American history.”   Sources:   https://www.gale.com/binaries/content/assets/gale-us-en/primary-sources/newsvault/gps_newsvault_19thcentury_usnewspapers_immigration_essay.pdf https://www.history.com/topics/immigration/u-s-immigration-before-1965 https://history.state.gov/milestones/1776-1783/declaration https://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/immigration-and-migration-colonial-era/ https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/brief-overview-american-civil-war http://immigrationtounitedstates.org/548-history-of-immigration-1620-1783.html  Kettner, James H.

"The earliest exclusion and laws that occurred were focused mainly on the Chinese in the form of the Foreign Miners' Tax Act of 1850.  The rise of this was due to the post gold rush economy.     Many of California's new gold rush prospectors arrived to find out there wasn't much in the way left for them to make their fortunes.  So while the first arrivals didn't mind the Chinese when there was enough gold to go around for everyone--when it started to run dry, the resentment began to build.  The Miners Tax ended up failing and led to the dying of Chinese gold camps which led to an influx of low cost Chinese laborers in cities.    California Governor John Bigler saw political value in attacking the “coolie” laborers and reinstated the failed tax.  The term ""coolie"" was supposed to imply these were low skilled and low wage slave laborers who are taking American jobs for their ""master"" back in China but these people were actually free.  The word itself comes from two Chinese words, “koo” meaning to rent, and “lee” meaning muscle.  This was a tough economic period in part due to the discovery of Australian gold.  In 1854 the California Supreme Court declared that the 1850 statute prohibiting Negroes and Indians from testifying for or against a White person applied also to Chinese for the reason that in the days of Columbus all of the countries washed by Chinese waters had been called “Indian.”  Most of the Chinese came on an arrangement similar to some of the first settlers where they pay back the trip fees plus interest with the wages from their first job.  Unfortunately, this led to many of them not being able to afford to bring their wives and created an enormous prostitution industry for Asian women and comments by Americans heroes like this.    >While this is being done I invite the attention of Congress to another, though perhaps no less an evil--the importation of Chinese women, but few of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful occupations.  Ulysses S. Grant   The Page Act of 1875  was the first federal anti immigration law that intended to ban all ""Coolie labor"".  Only the restrictions on female Asians were heavily enforced.   Things got economically bad after 1877 and led to Chinese establishments being sacked and burned and Chinese being shot and hung.  They saw that the Chinese had monopolized multiple manual labor industries like laundry, construction and landscaping for wages they couldn't beat and reacted poorly.    In 1882 the government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act that banned all Chinese immigration for ten years.   One of the common themes of these acts and laws that were passed is economic climate.  In harsher times people seemed far more likely to lash out at those deemed different enough.  In the next two decades and in the early 1900's we started to see more of a rise of anti immigration sentiment towards southern and eastern European groups like the Catholics (Irish, Polish, Italians) as well as Jewish people though it would continue to increase after the great depression and around WW2.

Hamilton was from Nevis, a small anglophone island in the Caribbean, and not from Puerto Rico. He has no connection to Puerto Rico.   I’m also not at all an expert on this, but to what extent can you consider Hamilton an immigrant when he migrated between British colonies? If I move from the US Virgin Islands to Samoa, am I an immigrant? These are very culturally distinct places, but they’re both American colonial holdings. The same would be true for Hamilton moving from the British colony of Nevis to the British colony of New York. 
IIRC, Hamilton was from Nevis, not Puerto Rico.

"Children's culture in history can be difficult to study. Adult observers tend to reflect more formal types of play and practice; memoirs reflect the haze of memory and *desired* memory; it's sometimes difficult to tell whether schoolbook exercises represent an individual experience or a standard trope. In this case, fortunately, a look at the broader culture of children's wargaming in early modern Europe can help answer the question.  Children's play often imitates the adult world for two reasons: first, children mirror what they see; second, adults encourage it to help prepare children for the future. The encouragement of martial play among boys (only boys) in the late Middle Ages and early modern era is a good illustration of these. We have stories from hagiography of the future saint who stepped aside from the mock swordfighting to play at being a priest dispensing the Eucharist, and proverbs observing that when children play at swords, war is in the air. From the adult encouragement angle, with the rise of a visible toymaking industry from the fourteenth century, hobby-horses and swords were among the most popular items.  Although toy guns start to appear from the later half of the sixteenth century, it's really in the seventeenth that guns displace the swords of knighthood as boys' wargame toy of choice. This is in conjunction with the encouraged realism of militaristic play. Memoirs of noblemen raised at a royal court, like Louis Henri with Louis XIV, stress the popularity of fully organized ""armies"" of boys marching and drilling under their ""commander,"" the king. And this was in no way limited to the elite of the elite. Army-style drills were not just a major component of the all-around education of boys at grammar and secondary school--school sponsorship of these types of exercise actually served as a *marketing appeal*. The Lincoln Grammar School stressed the realism of its schoolyard play in opposition to ""childish games"": *its* students ""exercised in all their military postures, and in assaults and defenses.""  And from the 17th century, assaults and defenses meant guns.  With princes and high nobles, it seems that the guns and cannons would be smaller, boy-sized versions, but real. Louis Henri describes learning how to shoot with a harquebus that then-Prince Louis gave him, and mentions how he and the other boys (which is to say, their fathers) lavished the future king with many and diverse shooting weapons.  But moving down the social ladder to the urban middle classes (presumably), actual toy guns were *exceedingly* popular among boys. Actual records are scanty, of course, but archaeological digs and trawls of the Thames (where worn out or unneeded toys might be disposed of, or make their way there through a sewer or settlement) turn up toy guns and cannons as among the most numerous survivals. And for the most part, these toys appear to have been designed for mock shooting, including packing with powder and pellets to fire.  But children playing with toy guns in the manner they were designed to be used by adults is not yet the same as children making the leap themselves. For *that*, we turn to disciplinary and legal records of situations where boys improvised. One student of the Bodwin School participated in wargaming exercises not just by carrying a dummy gun. He actually got a candle, hollowed it out, and packed it with powder. This isn't a mock stick, but it's pretty close.  There are plenty of tragic events where children did not realize a gun was loaded, went to play with it, and killed a playmate or bystander by accident. But one case from turn of the 18th century London demonstrates the realism that permeates surviving accounts of boys' wargaming. A twelve-year-old apprentice came across his master's gun and wanted to play with it. But he wasn't content to point and cock and click, like plenty of boys did in the cases where the gun proved to be loaded. No, for this boy, playing with guns started with inserting the stick and packing it with powder.  Some caution is of course warranted. These aren't cases of boys pointing sticks at each other and making exploding noises with their mouths. And surviving sources, as I've discussed, are going to be biased towards more realistic types of games. Nevertheless, the combination of being so steeped in militaristic ""play"" and the general tendency to learn adulting by observation led our two improvisers to want ""toy guns"" that mirrored the real thing at every step except the very last. It seems likely, therefore, that just like we can all remember a range of ways we ""played pretend"" with ""guns"" when we were little, 17th and 18th century boys also scaled up towards imitating the real thing with whatever they had.

Wow great answer! Wasn't expecting much of a response. 
This is such a cool answer to a question I would've never thought to ask.  Do you know when and why the organized/sponsored practice of giving boys boy-sized guns and cannons and marching and drilling them became less commonplace or acceptable?
You mentioned toy guns displacing toy swords. Do we know about any other toy weaponry, such as playing at archery or pole arms, in centuries where units of spearmen or bowmen were prevalent in the military? 
In the 13th century German Arthur/Round Table romance *Parzival*, Wolfram von Eschenbach describes Our Hero as a child going into the woods to play with a toy bow.  This is evidence from undeniably fictive literature, of course, but one of the ways historians work with imaginative narrative is to consider the importance of *plausibility*. In order for the audience to buy in to the fiction, other elements of the story must ring true to life. Accounts of childhood in medieval texts *not* focused on children (such as the early chapters in a saint's *Life* or the childhood of a romance hero such as Parzival) are one of the major sources for medieval history of childhood.
"The Oxford [Science Fiction Citations Project](http://www.jessesword.com/sf/list/?page=6) aims to track down the earliest use of terms in a ""science fiction sense"" (for example, *credit* was in common use to mean ""buy now, pay later"" before it was adopted by SF writers as the generic Currency of the Future; this group is concerned with the latter). It's interesting that [various types of laser weapon](http://www.jessesword.com/sf/list/?page=6) are first mentioned in a cluster in the 1960s. ""Laser gun"" appears to have prior useage as a tool rather than a weapon.  But the general principle of a futuristic weapon? A laser gun by any other name would be just as precise when shot by Imperial stormtroopers?  It's not until the so-called ""theatrum mechanorum"" literature of the late 15th century that we start to see in Western/Mediterranean literature a comfort with *extrapolating* speculatively from current technology to future possibilities. People just didn't envision a future world that looked *technologically* different from their own (while at the same time, incremental improvements in all sorts of technology stack up throughout the Middle Ages). There are some earlier engineering texts from the Islamic world that attack new and improved ways to make existing technology/make it better at what it does. And even the designs in the libri mechanorum of the 15th-16th centuries feature creative permutations of existing technology into bigger machines (there are some really interesting examples for firefighting, for example) rather than something parallel to the modern concept of ""futuristic.""  On the other hand, if you'll permit a jump across the Atlantic, I think there is evidence that early modern (and early, modern) children in their own imagined worlds would have been on the futuristic/alternative scale of imagination creation just like today. First, we have a lot of evidence for the practice of either improvising toys or straight-up creating them in colonial America. Boys in particular would carve mock guns out of wood. There's even actual evidence for what shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who remembers being a kid: the ability to transform a mundane object into an elaborate reality. One New Jerseyite recounted watching his friend's little daughter tie strings to the back of a chair and then walk back and forth and wrap them, which in her mind was a spinning wheel.  Second, you'll recall that the examples I discussed in the OP involve mirroring or recreating adult culture, with an eye towards becoming an adult one day or admiring them in the present. With toy laserguns, on the other hand, we've moved into the idea of something that represents a different culture. Howard Chudacoff, *Children at Play: An American History,* describes white colonial boys demonstrating the kernel of this type of practice. They would play with bow and arrows or mock arrows in imitation of their ideas about Native Americans.  Third and combining those two points: the long, gradual incubation of science fiction as a literary genre across the 19th century coincides with the rise of children's literature (as entertainment). One of the foremost figures in this movement was the recurring character Frank Reade, Jr.--the teenage inventor. He had engineering-based adventures all over the U.S., in books by multiple authors, that hinged on his invention of wild new technologies. (Steampunk before punk, if you will). True, these were written by adults. But their overwhelming popularity among younger readers suggests the dazzling appeal of ""futuristic technology"" as entertainment. And while I'm not familiar with firsthand accounts of ""playing Frank Reade,"" the idea of replicating literature in play has a rich presence in 19th century literature (including books popular with younger readers, if not necessarily children). I'm pretty sure I first learned about *Pilgrim's Progress* by reading how the March sisters would ""play"" it!  Given what we know about the propensity towards improvisation and the fun that could be had imitating cultures besides one's own impending adulthood, it seems reasonable that children's imaginary worlds sometimes did expand to encompass the idea of a technologically-different future that becomes so crucial to a rising genre of literature."
"Don't be fooled by myths of ""the first Thanksgiving."" Traditionally, white Americans have been far more interested in ignoring or eradicating Native foodways than embracing them. Since this question asks about ""Native American"" restaurants specifically, I'll focus on a couple of moments in restaurant history where food perspectives of various Native peoples were cut out of wider American fine and family dining. However, an integral part of the story is indeed the targeted destruction of Native food cultures by white Americans - especially since, archaeologists and oral tradition tell us, adoption and modification of foodways rather than wholesale switchover had been the result of intertribal contact before 1500.   The corn/squash/beans agriculture of the Southwest nations had spread east and then north up the Mississippi and tributaries. But the Algonquians and Iroquois, like other Eastern Woodlands nations, would spend the winter in their permanent towns and villages through the spring planting season, then move to waterlines (rivers, lakes, ocean) for a few months. They would catch and preserve fish for the present and for the rest of the year, and return home when the crops needed taking care of and harvest. The foraging and hunting seems to have been traditional to the Eastern Woodlands people before the addition of agriculture--the Algonquians only added farming in the 16th century, it seems, later than the Iroquois. The introduction of new technology and even new foods, in other words, did not have to destroy foodways. Unfortunately, that would become a major reason for the scarcity of Native American or specific Native nations' restaurant cuisine today.  The first stage in American restaurant history I want to look at is the mid-19th century. The rise of ""dining establishments"" had happened quickly from the age of the smalltime colonial tavern - a skyrocketing American economy drew international businessmen to glittering urban hotels, whose dining rooms became well-known and catered to an audienced used to, above all, French and English food. It was the needs of business that, in America, detached food service places from sleeping, as workers in the earlier 19th century needed lunch on the job.  Why this mattered was the creation of highly ""ethnic"" communities in cities and rural/township regions through immigration, settlement, and employment patterns. From the 1840s, as midday food service places proliferated and eventually broadened their service, immigrant groups built their own ethnic food places to serve their own communities - the innumerable *Biergarten* of St. Louis, Missouri, for example. (Budweiser beer was born out of one such - failing! - establishment after the Civil War). For the most part, ethnic restaurants continued to target only their linguistic/cultural community. But it's significant for our overall story because it marks the foundational establishment of ethnic cuisine at a time that explicitly excluded Native nations.  Because, for those of you keeping score at home, that era that America was beginning to host ethnic restaurants was the same period that white America doubled down on its endless campaign of cultural genocide against Indians.  The deportation and exile of Indigenous people to typically isolated reservations - the areas white people didn't want to live! - by logic removed them from the opportunity to plant restaurants in bustling towns and thriving cities. But more importantly, the forced moves inherently ruined existing foodways in a lot of cases (you can't fish for salmon in the richest waters if you don't have access to the richest waters) and white American policies took care of the rest. The kidnapping of Native children and compulsory acquisition of Anglo-American cookery skills at boarding schools and mission schools went a long way towards wiping out traditional patterns.  In some cases, Indian cultures had the ability to adapt traditional foodways to new technology and ideas the same way white Americans were adopting their traditional cuisine. The Objibwa method of drying blueberries was superseded by canning technology and processed sugars, but they nevertheless continued (and continue today) to keep berries as a major part of their diet. (On the other hand, pressure from outside meant the berries were increasingly used in very European pies and European-style puddings, not ones thickened by corn as had been prepared for centuries.) In other cases, though, traditional knowledge was lost - actively destroyed - altogether.  Back on the restaurant scene: American xenophobia and (ironically) nativism in the early 19th century kept the ethnic restaurants and ethnic food - above all the ""spicy"" dishes of Italians and Chinese and other not-white-enough immigrants - somewhat sequestered in their own communities. However, one should note that the increasingly shrill anti-flavor voices were probably reacting to an increased broader public acceptance of said edible food. Some of the early cracks in the shell came through the World's Fairs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where Americans could dine on the ""cuisine of foreign countries"". Of course, this meant largely foreign *white* countries. The World's Fairs were rather better known for showing off the technological and cultural achievements of one set of countries and peoples, and showing off *individual, living human beings* of another set of countries and peoples as curiosities in and of themselves. So again, Native Americans - and here we should note also the scarcity of sub-Saharan nations' ethnic restaurants in the U.S. - were left out of the broadening of the white American palate.  The explosion in cookbooks and preserved foodstuffs in the early/mid-nineteenth century was actually a time Native women, in particular, tried to capture and assert the strength of their cultural foodways. In 1933, the Indian Women's Club of Tulsa, Oklahoma produced the first Native cookbook. You can read [one recipe](https://books.google.com/books?id=JTBSpuCkl9AC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22indian+cook+book%22+oklahoma+1933&source=bl&ots=R7lh_cIgFv&sig=ycw8WBSieKkEqT5MW-YQb7UdOoo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiszbyC36rXAhWH1IMKHQvyBXMQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&q=%22indian%20cook%20book%22%20oklahoma%201933&f=false), from Creek Indian and club president Lilah Lindsay, on Google Books! Amanda Amanda's *Choctaw Indian Dishes* in 1935 seems to have been the first professional cookbook promoting one tribe's foodways.  Native women's efforts in the cookbook scene went further towards *preserving* various cultures' foodways for themselves and for each other, than promoting it to a broader American public with more money and more desire to ""eat out"" for entertainment and family socializing. The 1940s seem to have been the era when ""dining *ethnic*"" took off as a popular social act. Especially in major cities, immigrants began to establish restaurants outside their country-of-origin neighborhood.   However, once again, the foodways that became popular with white people were most often associated with Europe - in particular France, at this time, actually. (AskHistorians has some experts on Asian-American food cultures who will know more about that particular evolution). And once again, Native Americans were systematically excluded from this development, with the endurance of the reservation system and the difficulties or impossibilities of living an explicitly and marked Native life *as a community* outside.   Native nations were also excluded from the rise of ""American regional"" dining, which is generally considered to have been born with the Four Seasons in 1959. ""Regional"" did not include the Native map of America.  Every history of Native foodways will end with a spot of hope for the future. The tradition of cookbooks established by Lilah Lindsay and the Indian Women's Club of Tulsa, to which we probably owe a sizeable debt for preservation of traditional recipes through the mid/late-20th century rise of TV dinners and standardized fast food fare, flourishes; maybe you *have* had the chance to be a guest at a powwow or attend a restaurant featuring traditional local Native foods as opposed to simply appropriating the name.  I hope that a lot of you really interested in the question of why most of us *don't* have much exposure to Native American foods today will head over to /r/IndianCountry and read or ask a little about how to *get* that exposure. :)  ~~  Some further reading, as requested (thank you for your patience):  * *Routledge History of American Foodways* is a great place to start * *Food in Time and Place*, ed. Freedman et al., has several helpful essays, including ""Food and the Material Origins of Early America"" and ""Restaurants"" * Harvey Levenstein, *Revolution at the Table* * Krishnendu Ray, *The Ethnic Restaurateur*"
To add on this if I'm allowed... what is an example of native American food. I know it likely varied by region. We all know the stereotypes of plain dwellers eating buffalo and the early settlers learning how to grow corn from the local natives. But does anyone know if there is any native cuisine? 
"Founder/mod of /r/IndianCountry reporting in.   The questions as parsed by OP and labeled by this mod team focus on the modern period, which is often neglected when discussing Native Americans.   We've aggregated a few stories about this found by searching for ""[food](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/search?q=food&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)"" or ""[cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/search?q=cooking&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)"" or ""[chef](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/search?q=chef&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)."" You'll likely find a few examples of Native American restaurants offering interpretations of specific regional cuisine among the searches and other submissions here you may see.  #Mainstream Examples Hidden in Plain Sight  The *glib* answer to both questions is ""[We call it Famous Dave's](https://www.famousdaves.com/), given that its founder, David W. Anderson is Choctaw and Ojibiwe, formerly AS-IA of DOI (2004-5).   Going more local as to Washington, DC, there's the [Mitsitam Cafe](http://nmai.si.edu/visit/washington/mitsitam-cafe/) at the National Museum of the American Indian. It's the most ostensibly Native American restaurant in the city, offering a variety of cuisine. The fry bread was a problem until Executive Chef Freddie Bitsoie (Diné [Navajo]) began his tenure.  Going deeper, people often do not consider the deep Native American roots in Soul Food and Southern Cooking generally, which borrows staples and dishes from Southeastern Tribal Nations.   #A Local Example Hidden in Plain Sight  This will be as granular I can make it and I hope it doesn't result in loss of appetite.  My Tribal Community is Pamunkey, known as ""Pocahontas' people"" by mainstream references, recently acknowledged by the US in 2016. Our most recent treaty is the 1677 Treaty of Middle Plantation (modern Williamsburg) and the Pamunkey Reservation was established by treaty, prior to 1658. However, despite my family maintaining their ties to Pamunkey, mine is largely an Urban Indian experience in the DMV (DC/MD/VA region), shaped by the Jim Crow South, segregation, and the post-segregation periods. Save for a few families who remained exclusively on either Pamunkey or Mattaponi Reservations, the vast majority of the regional ""Indian Experience"" has been a combination of rural and urban for the past 200 years.   Some of us have opened restaurants and many of us have attempted to blend in by not being explicit about race; we are deeply in the minority and, frankly, it's often a political and economic liability to declare indigeneity in this long, insistently racially binary region. It's not entirely by free personal choice, as the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 criminalized off-reservation Indian identity in Virginia until *Loving v. Virginia* and regional state-sponsored document genocide efforts continued afterwards, arguably to this day in weaker forms. Long contact means varying degrees of mixture with other communities. Racial purity is a unrealistic and unhealthy luxury that we could not and cannot afford, but local Indians have a good idea of what other local Indian families look like, our surnames, our hometowns, and our ancestral holdings.  Some of us don't have the option of passing for White or Black and sometimes we personally pay a kind of ""blood price"" for the the Tribal Communities we are born into, be it at the altar, on the street, or whether our employer has a strong opinion about local Indians (as opposed to people from non-local Tribes).    The local Native American scene in the DMV is split by State, Tribal Nation, Federal Acknowledgment status, Family, Employer, and Organization; it's rather segregated, despite areas of overlap. Southern Maryland had a particularly active local indigenous community along Route 301, which included a nightlife that the older generation might tell you about when their wives aren't in earshot.  *This is a long-winded way of saying that there is a non-zero chance of eating at a Native American restaurant in the DMV without knowing it*.  [The ""World Famous"" Florida Avenue Grill](http://floridaavenuegrill.com/), which bills itself as the ""Oldest Soul Food Restaurant in the World"" is undeniably a historical and popular establishment, and also arguably the best known *Native American* restaurant in DC that you've never heard or thought of as such.  Its founders, the Wilson family, are Occaneechi (now recognized by North Carolina as the Occaneechi Band of Saponi) and I've never heard Lacey C. Wilson, Jr. describe himself in any other way. He's bled for that, but you wouldn't know it unless you were one of the local families. My mother conducted interviews with him, but she has exclusive control of the material, which will *hopefully* not pass into my possession any time soon. The food is fantastic, although I haven't eaten there in years."
"I previously worked on cultural resources (gathering historic research, identifying culturally-sensitive plants and natural resources, and communicating with local tribal representatives) for military installations in the Pacific Northwest. Just moved to the Southeast where I helped with an intertribal powwow, but I'm still learning about the local history and tribes here. When I use the word ""American"" or ""Native/Native American"" I refer to North American or North American Indigenous, respectively, though again my expertise is more from the PNW.   Much of what is currently, regularly eaten by many Native Americans is not the same as what their ancestors traditionally ate and prepared. Communities on some reservations sometimes face the same sort of food deserts that many non-Native American neighborhoods suffer from--cheap junk food and limited fresh produce. Access to traditional ingredients or food knowledge can be very limited. For example, on a lot of the Army training grounds in WA, the military is supposed to immediately cease training to allow (some, depending) tribes to forage for native plants needed for traditional food preparations and ceremonies, though I've personally never met anyone who said they recall them actually exercising that right. These plants don't exactly grow on the most accessible terrain. And when I was gathering information on native plants for signage, I discovered that much of it had traditionally been eaten--but were often regarded as famine foods, or had challenging preparations (such as [Chinook acorns, which required curing in urine](https://books.google.com/books?id=IQdpCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT80&lpg=PT80&dq=chinook+olives&source=bl&ots=FkXAZj039c&sig=GLx_W6oReHa1VQaNwZqxonHbUUA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjR1KGYxKrXAhVH8WMKHVAYDf0Q6AEIYjAO#v=onepage&q=chinook%20olives&f=false)). So it would be difficult to open a commercially viable restaurant based on either current Native eating habits or using some of the more hard-to-access or prepare foods.  We do, however, eat and prepare plenty of foods that stem from traditional Native American cuisine in much of what we regard as wider ""American"" cuisine. The use of green chili in the Southwest, cornbread/corn pone ([the word pone itself comes from Eastern Algonquian languages](http://www.talk-lenape.org/results?query=ahp%C3%B2n&lang=lenape)), succotash, the use of filé powder in gumbo, and of course smoked salmon and jerkey are examples. The pit-style form of barbeque is believed to derive from a traditional style of cooking meat observed in the Amerindians from the Caribbean up to as far as New York. So you could say that restaurants serving uniquely American fare already have some native cuisine incorporated into them. As far as whether a Native American restaurant ""was ever popular in the US"" in the past, prior to say the 2000s, this might be the closest you'll get.   There is definitely growing interest in reviving Native cuisine in the PNW, Canada, and Mid-West US, I believe in part due to increased curriculum focusing on native plants and food preparation at some of the local colleges (like Evergreen State) and Northwest Indian College. Indian Colleges especially seem to be finding creative ways to connect students with their heritage such as in their food science and culinary arts departments. Sources for what they teach include documents like [The Ethnobotany of Western Washington](https://books.google.com/books?id=7Vo3lD_V9JUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ethnobotany+of+western+washington&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj97t3Qy6rXAhUP-GMKHbzMDHIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false), in which the food and cultural values of various native plants were recorded for various PNW tribes (interestingly the interviewer tried to discuss each plant with both a man and woman from each tribe, since women were often more familiar with the culinary and medicinal uses and men tended to be more familiar with the plant's value for nets or woodworking), and [Buffalo Bird Woman's Garden](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/buffalo/garden/garden.html), which is a direct recounting of a Hidatsa Indian woman's descriptions of her village life, food preparation, and agriculture at Like-a-fishhook village prior to 1885. Lots of descriptions of food in that, and it's now being used by chefs such as Sean Sherman to recreate native cuisine. His consulting company, [The Souix Chef](http://sioux-chef.com), has been working on this sort of research and promoting healthy native cuisine. Ever since around 2010 there has been increased attempts at Native American restaurants, though because the genre of ""Native"" fine cuisine is still attempting to define itself, it's been challenging for some of the restaurants. Landlords know that it's not exactly a Yelp category that most customers will be searching for, so business loans and securing space [can be more challenging than when starting restaurants of other cuisines](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/why-its-hard-for-successful-native-american-restaurants-to-expand/489449/). There are debates as to how closely Native American cuisine should stick to its historic roots. And items such as the frybread at the National Museum has been [controversial](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/frybread-79191/?no-ist) due to its origins as an essentially non-nutritious survival staple on reservations--a last resort when they were denied access to traditional ingredients, and a reminder of the injustice. And different tribes, and sometimes each family, has their own way of making and serving it, so it's difficult to say whose recipe (if any) should be a representative of a whole continent's traditional food, especially since that one Native restaurant might be the only direct experience with Native food that most folks might experience. Still, there's increasing research and education on traditional Native American cuisine, as well as increasing public awareness (somewhat, at least in some places) and demand for more unique restaurants, so there's all the factors that could hopefully lead to a flourishing new restaurant category.

As an add-on question, how were things such as vegetables prepared among natives? Did they fry or bake anything? Were the culinary talented recognized for their 'dishes' like chefs in the western world are?
As a follow up question, what about cookbooks?  I know that cookbooks from the middle ages Europe and early America are studied and occasionally the recipes are made, but I've never heard of Native American cook books.  Do any exist?  Was there a time in US history where they became popular?  And what common foods today are influenced by Native American foods and techniques?  What an interesting question, thanks OP.  Edit: I asked my wife about this and I posted her answer in another top comment.
Thank you for the thorough response. Unfortunately, I was looking at this from the perspective of the immigrant experience and had blinders on to such a basic premise as Indian Removal, as my reply to /u/Opechan indicates.   As white Americans began slipping past the Know Nothing cudgel and into ethnic restaurants, the reservation system was, as you say, enduring. But the rise of casinos and gaming on reservations in the 1980s(?) seems like it would have been an opportunity to introduce Native American menus to the general public. Do you happen to know if that happened at all?
"Different by region, I know Mohawk food which is Lake Ontario region. Maybe others could explain their region.   The food that the Mohawk tribe ate included the 'three sisters' crops of corn, beans and squash.  These crops were known as 'deohako' meaning ""life supporters"". Fish such as salmon were an important part of their food supply. Hunters provided meat from deer, moose, bear and small game like squirrel, duck, rabbit and wild turkey. The Mohawk food also included nuts, vegetables, mushrooms, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. The Mohawk used methods of drying and smoking to ensure that foods was available through the winter. Food was prepared in different ways and included soups, cornbread and stews.  Keep in mind a lot of Mohawk cooking had changed by European influence but the gist of Native American cuisine is find where the tribe is from and then look at the foods that were available in that area. Chances are they used almost all of them."
This was asked awhile ago and there are some good answers in, and linked in, the following thread:   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/71cyfg/what_do_we_know_about_native_american_cuisine/
Thanks for the response, but I do have two questions for you which I hope you could expand on a little, one specific and the other a bit more general.  You mention 'Famous Daves' and 'Florida Ave Grill', both of which I've been to, and off hand at least I don't remember any influence of the founders' respective cultural heritage on the menu, but maybe I'm ordering the wrong things? Or perhaps just been too long since I went to remember... In any case, does that influence their menus at all?  For Florida Ave Grill at least though, this does bleed into my second question since, it being a 'Soul Food' joint, you mention the broader influence of Native American cuisine in the traditions of Southern Cooking and Soul Food, so I was hoping that you could expand a little bit more on just what aspects we see those influences!

Anecdotally, I have seen *some* modest attempts at offering indigenous foods in a few tribal casinos, most commonly post-contact things like fry bread or on occasion local vegetables. But for the most part these casinos are businesses first and foremost (and are often operated by Las Vegas or Atlantic City corporations hired by tribal government); as such they cater to the tastes of their clientele. which in my experience is primarily older, white, and very much attuned to large portion sizes of familiar (i.e. brown) foods at low prices.   One source OP may find interesting though is the [Sioux Chef](http://sioux-chef.com/about/), a really fascinating food operation in Minneapolis. Per their page, they ""are a team of Anishinaabe, Mdewakanton Dakota, Navajo, Northern Cheyenne, Oglala Lakota, Wahpeton-Sisseton Dakota and are ever growing. We are chefs, ethnobotanists, food preservationists, adventurers, foragers, caterers, event planners, artists, musicians, food truckers and food lovers.""   They currently operate a food truck and a catering operation, and I think have a restaurant planned...I'm not sure, I just recall reading about a kickstarter for them last year. Their mission statement goes right to the heart of the question of ""is anyone doing this"" though, to wit: **""We are committed to revitalizing Native American Cuisine and in the process we are re-identifying North American Cuisine and reclaiming an important culinary culture long buried and often inaccessible.""**  Edit: Apparently [their new restaurant will open next year.](https://www.eater.com/2017/9/18/16326826/sioux-chef-new-restaurant-minneapolis-water-works) I don't know the Twin Cities but it sounds like a fairly high-profile location."
Do we know much in terms of what seasonings (herbs, spices, etc.) they used? Is there a flavor profile?
"There's no question that the prevalence of myopia (nearsightedness) was much lower in the Middle Ages than today. No, we have absolutely nothing even remotely resembling statistics, and just because in the past century or several there's been a noticeable increase in myopia doesn't itself say anything about medieval western Europe (what I'll be talking about here). However, medieval popular Christianity relied on *visuality* in some pretty basic ways I'm not sure it would have if 50% of some such of people couldn't see their own shoes. ""Art is the book of the illiterate"" was a basic philosophy of religious instruction. Church sculpture, mosaic, decorated rood screens, stained glass were meant to glorify God but also to instruct (hence the popularity of Last Judgment scenes over the tympanum). And watching the priest consume the Eucharist (bread and wine) could substitute for the person doing it themselves--even in the case of a saint like Nicholas von Flue.  But we also know that some people were indeed nearsighted, and obviously eyesight deteriorated in various ways (presbyopia/farsightedness, AMD, cataracts, etc) with ageing. I want to briefly introduce a distinction that scholars of disability and medicine make between ""impairment"" and ""disability."" Impairment *in this sense* is used as a deviation from the normative (not from the normal! lots of things are normal); disability refers to when an impairment affects someone's functioning in the world. Here, I'm going to talk more on managing visual impairment to minimize (not necessarily eliminate) disability.   This being the Middle Ages, obviously the first way people tried to cope was by praying for miracles. And indeed, miracle stories attached to saints and shrines offer some really interesting cases of the extreme end of visual impairment that's ""not quite blindness,"" although we should keep in mind that ""blind"" is a subjective term that means different things in different contexts.  Two important themes that arise from miracle stories are the effect on mobility and on ability to work. One of St. Elisabeth of Hungary's miracles concerns a girl who, it's clear, has some vision but only a little; the story emphasizes that she can't even see well enough to find her way on a path. (Medieval ""roads"" could just be a trampled line through fields). There's a similar miracle concerning a middle-aged man who developed possibly cataracts (*macula*, stains) and similarly couldn't find his way on a path; he reported being ridiculed for it.   In these cases, the key was to lean on the support of other people. We read a lot about blind and otherwise visually impaired people being ""led"" to shrines. That's probably the single most common theme in anecdotes of people with disabilities in the Middle Ages--the ad hoc, case-by-case reliance on friends and family, or in a few cases monastic charity.  With respect to work, it seems that in a lot of cases the key was to find a task a person could perform. The miracles of St. Bertin tell of one evidently nearsighted man who couldn't see well enough to perform outdoor manual labor, but up very close could still see well enough to do needlework. So he sat with the women of the duke's household all day, working on embroidery and weaving!  The later Middle Ages did have knowledge of and practice rudimentary cataract surgery, sometimes even successfully. In 1351, aging abbot Gilles le Muisit of St. Martin's in Tournai had his cataracts removed only to find that behind them, he was farsighted:  > I saw not as in my young age but as my age demanded, because I was already an octogenarian, and I saw the sky, the sun, the moon, the stars, though not perfectly recognizing people, and I saw everything at a distance from me very well, but I was not able to write or read.  The first ""glasses"", which were designed to be held rather than worn, were for reading (i.e. for farsightedness). [Here's a photo](https://imgur.com/a/7KRHt) I took in the Dominican church museum in Eisenach of a 1510 altarpiece relief from Thuringia--the scene is the death of the Virgin Mary, and the man with the book and glasses is probably supposed to be a physician. Glasses were one type of iconographic shorthand for physicians (another being a flask filled with urine. You do you, Middle Ages.)  Ronald Finucane and Irina Metzler have both pointed out that we are much less likely to read about nobles with disabling conditions. There was then as there is now a stigma attached to disability, even more so because of the stronger link between sin (moral failure) and impairment. So even in miracle stories that *do* involve knights and other nobles, the recorder will allow the healed to express a sense of shame--even to the point of feeling suicidal, in one case--a consciousness of emotion denied to lower classes.   That was the case with the knight Gilbert, whose story is told in the miracle of St. Foy. *Twice in a row* he received a head injury in combat--once while, apparently, breaking up a barfight--that caused vision problems. And he was, given the source, miraculously healed in several stages. (Draw your own medical conclusions.)  But one of the most interesting cases hops way above the others. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century--the one who looked at the Crusades, said ""I got u, fam"" and *negotiated* his way into taking over Jerusalem from Muslim control--actually dealt with developing myopia over the course of his life. This could have been a hardship for him, as his true love was hunting. (He embarked on very few building projects over the course of his reign, but these included several hunting lodges, which is also where he preferred to spend much of his time). What did he do? He still hunted with great enthusiasm, apparently. But then, hunting in the Middle Ages wasn't about food (unless you were desperate and poaching), it was about power and masculinity and status and probably blowing off some steam. So even in the parts where humans didn't rely on their dogs and birds to do the work for them, perhaps there was not as much pressure to perform.  But then, of course, there's the ultimate solution. Can't fight like a knight, can't hunt as well as you want to?  Write a book about it.  And Frederick did."

So in the Late Middle Ages, they were able to hold a person still, cut through the cornea, extract the lens, hope it didn't get infected, presumably just bandage over the eye until the cornea healed up? Nothing to lose I suppose in trying - severe cataract, you can't see anything, so you wouldn't get any worse.   Is there anything more you can tell us about that, or a reference? Who would do that sort of surgery? Presumably someone who had experience with cadaver eyes. What sort of tools did they use? Was the patient sedated in any way (drunk)?  > only to find that behind them, he was farsighted  In front of them, really. The cornea does most of the heavy lifting with regard to focus. If you could get a cataract out and the cornea healed OK, it would be a miraculous restoration of distance vision., just no ability to accommodate.

">> The later Middle Ages did have knowledge of and practice rudimentary cataract surgery  >***WOAH,*** hold on a second! You can't just drop that and keep going...  Cataract surgery was performed even prior to medieval times, though the real early stuff wasn't cataract *extraction* just yet.  The earliest record of a cataract being operated on may be from Ancient Egypt.  The Code of Hammurabi (approx. 1754 BC) even has mentions of a sliding scale of different prices for ophthalmological procedures.  But if I understand correctly, those procedures were the ""couching"" technique, where the cloudy lens was just pushed out of the way, to the bottom of the eye.  Cataract extraction surgery was done later.  There have been tools found dated to the 2nd century AD that were likely for this use, and the first written records of this procedure comes from 10th century Persian and Iraqi texts, one of which mentions a 2nd century source.  (They cut a hole and sucked them out with a hollow needle.)  What we usually think of now as cataract surgery--extracapsular cataract extraction--was first done on April 8, 1747 by French ophthalmologist Jacques Daviel.  ----  F.J. Ascaso and V.

"This is a matter of knowing versus comprehension. It's also a matter of practicality. Yeltsin could have undoubtedly found out the contents of the average American grocery had he cared to. It's doubtful the United States would have exerted much effort to stop him from discovering Pudding Pops or Coca-Cola. But Yeltsin never had any reason to. It was simply never relevant. Do you think Donald Trump or Obama have ever shopped in a Chinese supermarket? Probably not. It's just not relevant to their lives.  Yeltsin also probably had statistics on standards of living available to him. But it's another thing to actually see and experience it. In addition, coming from the Soviet world where statistics were often... dubious if not outright fabricated, he had at least some reason to be suspicious.  Now, onto the context. What is not open for debate: Yeltsin did indeed visit an American grocery store. He had, by all reports, a grand time. He tried some of the wares and the manager gave him some free food to take with him. He inquired about the food distribution system and how managers were chosen. He was deeply affected by this and repeatedly commented on how much better the standards of living in the US were, both to people there and to his aides. Likewise, Yeltsin' assessment that the United States was wealthier and did a better job providing for its people was simply objectively correct. There is some controversy on this point by Soviet apologists, but I'm not aware of any mainstream historian who disagrees. (There are reasons for this other than Communism, but this does not change the standards of living themselves.)  All this is attested to by multiple sources who tell the same broad story with only a few minor contradictions or unverified reports. One aide, for example, recalls Yeltsin planned to open his own chain of grocery stores on this model, and spoke about grocery stores as the fundament of the modern world. While this is not mentioned in other reports, it doesn't really introduce ambiguity into the narrative. It broadly agrees with the other accounts and doesn't contradict them in a meaningful way.  But let's pull back a little. Because this incident didn't come out of nowhere. The Soviet Union and the United States had been competing on the standards of living for decades, going back to the '50s. Before Yeltsin visited the supermarket there were multiple incidents like the Kitchen Debates and other displays where both sides tried to outdo each other in living standards. In reality, the United States was always ahead but the Soviet Union was willing to lie to make it seem otherwise. From time to time, someone would expose this and embarrass the Soviets.  By making a surprise visit and comparing conditions, Yeltsin was acting in a tradition that would have been familiar both at home and in the United States. The surprise was that Yeltsin openly admitted his side wasn't winning. *That* had never happened before.  Why did he do that? Well, he says in part because it was true. And it certainly was true. But, and I have no citation for this, politicians lie. And (I do have a citation for this) the Soviets lied all the time to make themselves look better. Why the reversal?  The pat little story is that Yeltsin saw this grocery store and decided to fight Communism. This has no historical evidence: the reforms began in 1986 (three years before) and Gorbachev explicitly wanted to preserve Communism. Yeltsin was a critic but was not, at the time, explicitly anti-communist. The context was instead of a world where Gorbachev was trying to thaw relations with the United States and reform/revitalize the Soviet Union. He was a reformer doing battle with hardliners at home while trying to keep liberals from tearing the Soviet Union apart. And Yeltsin was a reformer.  By losing one of these 'kitchen debates' (for lack of a better term) he was damaging the conservatives who didn't want to admit the Soviet Union was behind while encouraging his own reformists. It was an attempt to show he was willing to break with previous policy and tradition to force the Soviet system to be examined and reformed. At the same time, hardliners would be put in the awkward position of having to lie without the support of the Soviet government (as a result of Gorbachev's reforms). And without that support, their lies would be much more apparent. It would also warm relations with the west at a time when the Soviet Union was vulnerable (and where Gorbachev was trying to warm the relations).  But none of this answers the more personal question. This is more an explanation of why friendliness to the West fit well into his general program. *Why* did the visit affect him like this? Yeltsin undoubtedly had more power, prestige, and luxuries than anyone else in that store.  In short, because Yeltsin was a Soviet.  It's easy to dismiss people with different belief systems as either secretly believing what we believe or believing in some more base philosophy. For example, saying that Stalin's actions were not *really* about Communism but about power. No one could *really* believe that, could they? Well, usually, yes. They could and did. And Yeltsin's autobiography shows that he really, truly believed in Communism. But he believed it in a specific way: he believed it was *right*, that it was better for the working class. And this was blatant, empirical proof that the United States was beating them in providing for the working class. This is what he tells us himself.  And that genuinely shocked him.  **Sources:**  * Leon Aron, Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life (St. Martin's Press, 2000). * Mohr, Charles (25 July 1984). ""Remembrances of the Great 'Kitchen Debate'"".

There's definitely more to be said here, but I hope in the meantime you'll check out /u/Skiosmagus' earlier answer:  * [I've heard that Yeltsin was famously shocked by the luxury of a typical American supermarket? What are the historical facts behind this story?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6kh3dw/ive_heard_that_yeltsin_was_famously_shocked_by/)  Skiosmagus does quite a nice job contextualizing the anecdote and how it has become mythologized in the USSR's own self-image. It would be really great if we had someone come along who could contextualize Yeltsin's own account of it in his autobiography (how trustworthy is he? what images of himself, the USSR, and Russia was he using his life narrative to project? &c).  **ETA**: People are saying the above link doesn't work on mobile; it's fine on my laptop (Windows/Chrome).

I read a non-academic book a couple decades ago that said that Soviets consumed more of every class of food (grain, dairy, fruit, vegetables, etc.), except meat, than Americans.  Can anyone comment on that?  I'm not sure when it was referring to, though.  Edit: put it up as its own post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/874745/i_read_a_nonacademic_book_a_couple_decades_ago/).  Update: no, it is not true.  Americans ate more of everything but grain/potatoes.
Wow, thanks for this really in depth answer! It really makes him more human. 
You mention there are “...reasons other than Communism...” that the Soviet Union has a lower standard of living than the US. Is there a book by a reputable/mainstream historian that explains this in detail? Is there a book you’d recommend?
Having read the linked answer, I'm still left with the question...how could he have been so surprised? How could he not know? Was he a victim of propaganda himself, and if so, were there any in the Soviet leadership in the same position?
Hello. If you don't get an answer to this here, consider posting it as a separate thread. It will get more visibility that way, and so be more likely to get answered.

"""Yeltsin was a Soviet"" and ""Yeltsin was a Communist"" are not contradictions. Note this section:  > *""Yeltsin was a critic but was not, at the time, explicitly anti-communist""*  And also this:  > *""Yeltsin's autobiography shows that he really, truly believed in Communism""*  What I assume /u/Erusian means is: Yeltsin was born, raised in and shaped by the culture of the country he lived in. As a Soviet of the time, it was impossible to not view the plight of the working class as a core societal value. It's ingrained as part of your identity, be you rich or poor. Yelsin was molded by the USSR, and its values were a part of him.  Compare it to a statement like, for example: *""He believed in the importance of freedom of speech. Why? Because he was an American.""*"
"A reasonable trawl through the Internet will inform you that American universities borrowed the terminology from Oxford and Cambridge, where they had come to describe different levels of ""sophester"" or sophist--someone who *thinks they are* wise. (Sophomore adds on either a simple Latin -or 'operator' ending, or *possibly* Greek *moros*/fool--either way, the meaning is clear; the adjective ""sophomoric"" means immature). In the sixteenth century, *sophister* sometimes had an additional connotation of someone who takes money for teaching wisdom instead of ~~being an exploited adjunct~~ living a pure life of the mind or something--basically, a philosopher who sold out. This would track with the use of more advanced students employed to tutor earlier ones.  What the OED and blog posts *won't* tell you, on the other hand, is why the labels for students are inherently *insults*.  Medieval universities incubated a tradition that early modern ones would carry on with pride: periodically awful student behavior. (Also, you know, excellent academics & drool-worthy libraries & the foundation for modern scientific research &c &c.) Most infamous is student violence, of course--right along with universities' determination to shelter their own from charges of murder and rape.  But more to the point with the classifications is that university students also had a reputation for living up to a somewhat lower standard than what Robert Lowth wanted to see in Oxford:  > [A place] where a liberal pursuit of knowledge, and a genuine freedom of thought was raised encouraged and pushed forward by example, by commendation, and by authority  and somewhat more along the lines of what Edward Gibbon (yes, [our Edward Gibbon!](https://books.google.com/books?id=9fELAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA26&lpg=RA2-PA26&dq=To+the+university+of+Oxford+I+acknowledge+no+obligation;+and+she+will+as+cheerfully+renounce+me+for+a+son&source=bl&ots=Uzr90PgSM5&sig=X1F1rSTQayQuESXUUz9fTxZzfug&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI7_21xt3YAhVPA6wKHXg2DSYQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&q=To%20the%20university%20of%20Oxford%20I%20acknowledge%20no%20obligation%3B%20and%20she%20will%20as%20cheerfully%20renounce%20me%20for%20a%20son&f=false)) remembered:  > To the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life...  > In the university of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have for these many years given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.  > As a gentleman commoner, I was admitted to the society of the fellows, and fondly expected that some questions of literature would be the amusing and instructive topics of their discourse. Their conversation stagnated in a round of college business, Tory politics, personal anecdotes, and private scandal...The names of Wenman and Dashwood were more frequently pronounced, than those of Cicero and Chrysostom.  The point isn't that there were no deeply studious students making serious academic gains of their own and scientific progress overall, it's the *reputation* they had for being--well, *sophists*: more concerned with the social life of debate and politics and looking/acting smart to each other, than living up to some lofty ideal. Oxford opened its first coffeehouse in 1650. And by early modern coffeehouse, we should mean something like a literary salon--a place where the literati would gather to discuss intellectual topics and current events.  Of course, to contemporary eyes, this was a great deficit from what it should be. A 1901 investigation of Oxford in the 18th century summed up its findings in this description of freshman, freshly-minted college men:  > We see the public schoolman, just freed from the rod of Busby’s successors, strutting about town for a week or so before entrance, courting his schoolfellows’ envy...swaggering at coffee-houses, and giving himself a scholar’s airs at the bookshops.  and things did not improve over the years:  > A month or two sees them metamorphosed into complete smarts...The ""smart's"" breakfast is scarcely over by ten.  It's important to keep in mind that these attitudes were not only *external* in the sense of town-gown relations or alumni making a point about the quality of English universities compared to continental ones. Student university hazing could be absolutely brutal. Internal university hierarchy, built upon the idea that students with less experience were complete no-nothing fools, reigned supreme.  Most infamously, there's a late medieval sort of ""Latin textbook"" for university students that consists of a series of dialogues we think were meant to teach students useful Latin vocabulary for surviving uni daily life. One of the settings is a violent and humiliating initiation ritual in which the freshman or *beanus* is made into an animal that must be tamed. Well, scholars will continue to dispute whether in the 15th century this was a literary fantasy that drew on a solid tradition of hazing. On the other hand, there seems to be fairly solid evidence that early modern students at some universities took the *description* as *prescription*--and performed the hazing ceremony.  The straightforward etymologies of sophomore, junior (sophister), and senior (sophister) from Greek *sophia* and Greek/Latin *sophister*, in other words, aren't really the interesting part of the story--and a much funnier one for those of us who never attended college or have already graduated."
Not OP, but follow up questions: if these were originally insults, how/why did they get normalized into neutral titles? Why do high schools and colleges use the same ones? And, if Americans originally got it from Britain, then why do we still have it while they don't?
"It's worth noting that most sources actually believe ""sophos"" (wise) + ""moros"" (fool) to be a folk etymology of the word ""sophomore."" Of course, the oxymoron is amusing and surely adds the idea that students prance around with far more arrogance than they should, but that clever juxtaposition was unlikely to have been the impetus for the word's creation. More likely, the word ""sophomore"" derived directly from the single word ""sophumer"" (which, if I understand, is just an archaic variant of the word ""sophister"") and didn't cleanly spark into existence as a compound word meant to insult the do-nothing, faux intellectual. The word might, in part, owe its success through time to the serendipitous pairing of smart/dumb, but it wasn't coined solely for the sake of sarcasm."
Yes, I agree upon further research it's probably a folk etymology that looks exceptionally attractive because early appearances divide the word thus: Soph Mor, Sophy Moore. However, it's crucial to point out that *sophister* wasn't a neutral term--it had negative connotations as a contrast to philosopher on one hand, but more important, sophister/sophist carried well-entrenched connotations of false and/or presumed knowledge.

In other words, on /r/AskHistorians, we'd rather have no answer than bad attempts at answers. By deleting short, quick, bad answers, the well-researched in-depth answers (that take people time to research and write) are more likely to be seen. In general, on Reddit, [the early answers get the bulk of the karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/64y44g/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/#) regardless of quality. On /r/AskHistorians we want to make sure that the things that people likely actually read - the top post on a thread - are accurate. We want that top post to have the depth that a good understanding of history requires (people are complex, and so history is complex). Thus we remove answers that are not up to standard in order to reward the posters who - in their own free time, let's not forget - go to the effort of doing the research and writing up a quality response (which often takes *hours*).   As you can see from [this post on the statistics of AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6a5duv/a_statistical_analysis_of_10000_raskhistorians/) by /u/georgy_k_zhukov, 90%+ of popular threads like this will get an answer. That answer usually appears, on average, about 9 hours into the life of the thread. So while this thread does not yet have a suitable answer in it, if you are patient, something awesome will hopefully be here if you come back before too long. And if you want to read some awesome answers while you're waiting, might I suggest [the answers we link to on our Twitter](http://twitter.com/askhistorians), or [our weekly Sunday Digest feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) that links to overlooked posts that never got to /r/all but are often incredible?  Alternatively, if you want to discuss history or ask historical questions without these constraints, /r/history or /r/AskHistory might be a more appropriate subreddit for you than /r/AskHistorians.

"The Representation of the People Act of 1918 had not yet been passed when asylum would have been requested, and did not go into practice until the election that December, after Tsar Nicholas II had already been assassinated.   This gave the vote to all men over 21, and certain women. Previously, the vote had only been for landowning men, but only those that fit fairly exact standards that purposefully excluded many of the Irish, Scottish, and poor landowners.   Another modern standard may be women voting, which did not happen until the previous bill's follow-up, the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act of 1928.  Representation of the People Acts of 1948 and of 49 got rid of plural voting, which meant that you couldn't vote once for every property you owned. That was an antiquated technique for disenfranchising the poor which could be considered a roadblock to the term ""modern democracy.""  This is all not to mention that Britain ruled over a very large number of colonies at this time, and those subjects were not afforded the same rights, which may disqualify 1918 Britain from being a modern democracy."
The Representation of the People Act 1918 saw the introduction of near universal suffrage in Britain.  However even then women had to be over 30 to vote and meet other criteria (a member or married to a member of the Local Government Register, a property owner, or a graduate voting in a University constituency)  Under the Act men could vote at 21. It wasn't until ten years later and the passing of the Equal Franchise Act 1928 that women were given the same voting rights as men.   However a year earlier Britains would have been enfranchised by the Third Reform Act 1884 which had enfranchised most (but not all men) and no women at all.   http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/case-study-the-right-to-vote/the-right-to-vote/birmingham-and-the-equal-franchise/1918-representation-of-the-people-act/   http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/case-study-the-right-to-vote/the-right-to-vote/birmingham-and-the-equal-franchise/1928-equal-franchise-act/   http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/houseofcommons/reformacts/overview/one-man-one-vote/

"I can talk about several denominations within Christianity in Canada from the 50s onwards. These denominations (spec. Baptists, Mennonites, and CMA/CAMA, tended to be, and still tend to be, more conservative than other groups with Canada, including the RC church, Anglicans, and so on--though the latter are not my area of expertise). Please note that when I refer to ""Baptists"", I'm not referring to the Southern Baptist movement within the United States. ~~Rather, I'm talking about Canadian descendants of the Anabaptist movement in 16C. They may have similar roots but frankly I don't know.~~  Putting aside dietary restrictions for a moment, in the third quarter of the 20th century (so 1950-1975) there were strong taboos against men with long hair (1 Cor 11.14) and tattoos (Lev 19.28) in mainstream Baptist, Mennonite, and CMA congregations in Western Canada. Sermons were preached about it in many churches over many years. The same goes for tattoos, which were seen as unacceptable unless a church member were an adult convert. While the taboo against long hair grew less influential in the 80s, the taboo against tattoos lasted longer.   The question is, to what extent did existing religious norms influence society as a whole, as long hair, certainly, was seen to be a part of youthful rebellion. In smaller communities within AB, BC, and SK (and even larger centres such as Lethbridge), many businesses were simply closed on Sundays during this quarter. I would argue that, the more religious the community, the more influence that the church had upon individual towns, to the extent that Biblical precepts against working on the Sabbath influenced the culture as a greater whole. (Some of those restrictions, closures on Sunday in particular, still have ramifications today, but that's beyond the scope of this subreddit.)  Homosexuality within these groups was simply not tolerated, and abortion... well, that's an interesting topic, as the laws on abortion in Canada were loosened in 1967 as a result of Pierre Trudeau, himself influenced by the Quiet Revolution in the 60s (which saw a shift in societal values away from the Roman Catholic church and towards secularism). While abortion was quasi-legal at that time, it was still largely decried by many Christian churches within Canada, including Baptists and Mennonite groups, and CAMA/CMA (The Christian and Missionary Alliance).   There may be individual congregations with exceptions to the above rule, but looking at statements of belief from this era (and God help me but I can't find any of my old textbooks in which this was discussed... we're talking about mimeograph copies from provincial assemblies of the aforementioned groups, and I have no idea where they are), the above is by and large true.  So: the above groups largely condemned homosexuality (let alone gay marriage) and abortion, as well as tattoos, working on Sundays, and long hair for men. Consistent so far. Back to dietary restrictions: speaking of Christianity, there are no longer any dietary restrictions, period. In Acts 10 & 11, Peter has a vision in which God essentially tells him that it's okay to eat anything, that the old dietary laws of the Old Testament no longer applied. This is why Christians in general have no issue with eating anything, and that's a blanket statement that applies worldwide (with a few minor exceptions, such as Messianic Jews).   I understand that this is a very limited answer from a very limited geographical area within North America. I apologise for my lack of sources, but little on this can be found online outside of regional paper archives, and those are spread out and difficult to access on a Sunday afternoon (heh). The texts to which I have access, including *Readings in Baptist History: Four Centuries of Selected Documents* by Joseph Early and *Tracks and Traces: Baptist Identity in Church and Theology* by Paul Fiddes are broader and the former *does* talk about Southern Baptists; this would be a useful resource to look at belief statements from larger organising bodies. My post is related more towards *a posteriori* experiences in individual congregations in the latter part of the 20th century in W. Canada."
Follow-up/related question: were these other issues (tattoos, working on Sundays etc) ever politically important to Christians? When did they stop being important (politically at least)?
"[1/2]  I know, I know, reddit gloms onto anything that smells of religion and hypocrisy. But bear with me, because the intellectual and political developments in play are important to *understanding*, beyond any gut jerk condemnation or automatic acceptance.  The story that Christians tell themselves, passed down in the Book of Acts and some of the New Testament epistles, is that Jesus came and fulfilled the Law, that is, the Old Testament. It's pretty clear in context that the critical issue was nascent Christianity's built in mission (evangelization) imperative juxtaposed with Jewish prescriptions, most importantly circumcision, although kosher laws also feature prominently in the biblical discussion.  But while what is depicted by Christian tradition as a battle between ""Jewish Christians"" and ""Gentile Christians"" ultimately comes down on the side of God apparently no longer requiring circumcision in the ""new covenant,"" this hardly means that developing Christianity shed its Jewish roots including the Old Testament, or the Hellenized Roman culture in which it incubated. Everyone's favorite example here is abortion, so let's roll with it. Early and medieval Christians recognized abortion as a moral question, connected to infanticide. But perspectives differed-and would continue to differ-on when abortion began to be a problem. Was it always immoral? Or was it only immoral after the infusion of the soul into the body? And when was that, and was it different for boys and girls? As John Riddle points out, even as one tradition that would become canon law condemned contraception and abortion, some theologians continued to repeat earlier ideas and even mention recipes for contraceptives.  The complicating and complicated, but crucial, factor is sex. Christianity inherits a deep skepticism towards sex and the human body from Greek philosophy, to the extent that Jerome (who gave us the Vulgate Bible) argues that virgins should kill themselves to avoid the pollution of *being raped*. Of course, a society without sex is self-eradicating, and Christians quickly come up with the longstanding view that sex is okay if it is in accord with nature, that is, can lead to procreation. And the wonderfully spicy Song of Songs is reinscribed as an allegory: the love song between Christ and his Church or Christ and the soul (or, because he Middle Ages love you and want you to be happy, Christ and Mary, his virgin mother).  The spread and entrenchment of thhe Latin Church as a landed power over the early high Middle Ages introduced a new wrinkle to the concept of moral authority: legal authority, and the desire to shepherd and augment it for the salvation of as many people as possible. Christians have a harder task in the establishment of religious law than Jews and Muslims, since the NT works mightily hard to reject legalism as a principle. So canon (Church) law ends up cobbled together out of the Bible, philosophers, practical situations.  It's in the efforts to codify canon law in 11-12C that theolgians start to pay attention to sodomy with a definition of (male, primarily) homosexuality. Although it is still just one form of the ""sin against nature"", and there are no signs of active persecution from Latin Christians. But the codification of canon law reflects a long term trend in the west towards social order, hierarchy, purity, playing out above all on religious (anti-Semitism) and gender policing lines (misogyny, patriarchal families, strict gender roles and gender expression norms). Homosexual sex acts stack up poorly here, as you can imagine, and by the fifteenth century it can be and sometimes was punishable by death.  So what is the Bible doing in all this? As suggested by the multivalent interpretations of the Song of Songs (totally ripped from rabbinic readings of the love been God and his chosen people, by the way), medieval biblical interpretation was majestically flexible. This could lead to things like understanding the story of Jonah as a prophecy of Christ, descending into hell for three days, as well as being the story of a man who tried to say no to God and got eaten by a fish. Or it       could mean trying to apply the ""sons of Noah""-Shem, Japheth, Ham-as a paradigm to understand the peoples of an expanding (in Latin consciousness) world. The most famous medieval permutation here is the use of the curse of Ham to justify the existence of Latin, Christian serfdom. It often took on geographic origin meanings, however, which were as varied as the peoples of the Mediterranean world. In the early modern era, the western interpretation will harden into the ""curse of Ham"" that morally justifies the enslavement of black Africans by white Europeans and colonial descendants.  But that development, and even more its entrenchment, are somewhat of a departure in the evolution of European intellectual culture. Even as the Protestant reformers and the Catholic reaction supposedly streamline and ""harden"" biblical interpretation methods (don't worry, the Song of Songs lives on in all its meanings), first the influence of humanism and then the evolution of natural philosophy into science never quite allowed the Bible to be Clarissa Explains It All.  Well, nineteenth century coming at you to change all that.  An important evolution that is actually played out in interpretations of the curse of Ham story is a growing sense that slavery is a moral issue. Not just related to religious in-group-ism, but ownership of humans in light of humanity, period. Now, it's crucial to recognize the mutually reinforcing and guiding nature of religious beliefs/morality and other circumstances, be they political, economic, environmental, what have you. Mark Noll's *The Civil War as a Theological Crisis* (which is to some extent the point towards which so much of career oriented him) lays out cleanly that the split between Christians opposed to slavery and Christians supporting it broke down along the geographic lines you would expect, but also that both sides made religion the basis for securing popular support. Abolitionists appealed to the ideals of ""liberal theology"" (not in the modern US political sense) and biblical exegesis, favoring holistic readings and the ""sense"" of scripture. Slavery's defenders huddled down into what we call proof-texting: if you can find it in the Bible, somehow someway, it's God's inerrant word. Even if there are contradictory texts. This principle-fundamentalism, literalism, inerrancy-is a 19C invention. But so is the abolitionists' holistic reading. So is Luther's the Old Testament through the cross hermeneutic. So is medieval and patristic fourfold senses (historical and three allegorical forms).  All of these developments that I've talked about-sex, literalism, holistic/critical exegesis, race, moral politics, the role of religion in galvanizing political opinion and vice versa, tumble into the 20C. If anything, the Victorian and then Progressive era and its emphasis on ""middle class values"" (an adjusted vision of rightly ordered, moral society) demonstrated even more firmly the power of religion in spurring people's political activism as well as introducing new dimensions of concern over the policing of sex and, now, ""sexuality."" This period also saw a critical social invention in America: widespread, mandatory public education.  This was inseparable from religion, please understand. Apart from the Catholic Church's long leadership role in all levels of education and nuns as THE champions of educating girls, late 19/early 29C Catholics often perceived public schools as a covert Protestant indoctrination, hence the longstanding tradition of Catholic schools in many American cities. This is a vital precedent. Because when the US finally gets its head temporarily out of the racist sand and makes school segregation illegal, it's southern Christians in the same ""biblical inerrancy"" tradition who defended slavery, who lack qualms about expressing their racism.  I choose my word carefully here. Because you can certainly cherry pick quotes from the odd Protestant leader or Southern politician who explicitly links the rise of religious (Protestant, PLEASE) schools, mainly in the south, to a desire to prolong segregation. That's not the dominant narrative, you understand. Religious freedom! Need to secure the morality of our good sons and daughters! Gosh, and don't those race based admissions requirements make it a safer environment for the children. When the segregation policies were challenged in court (Green v. Connally; Coit v. Green), it was easy to sell this as religious persecution, not the government's rightful enforcement of due civil rights. And to be clear: the issue here wasn't about the closure of the schools. What got conservative Christians crying persecution! was the threat of revoking the schools' tax-exempt status. America, y'all.  The lesson, going forwards, would be the power of evangelical Protestant Christianity as a political force-to motivate its believers, and the vitality of the consenting-to-legal-racism white voter as a target bloc."
"  [2/2]  As I've gotten more into the history of the black liberation and women's liberation movements of the late 60s/early 70s recently, it's made an enormous impression on me just how radical a lot of the ideas and even some of the changes were, even down to the philosophical level. (A universal childcare bill passed Congress, FFS. Nixon vetoed.) Naturally, the changes made a lot of people very anxious, including many of the traditional power brokers (rich white men). Much has been made of the Republican ""Southern Strategy,"" that is, how to make racism The Issue without making racism the issue. The point of that, though, was to win voters over to a broader agenda of social, economic, and political retrenchment against an evolving society, and politicians were prepared to look anywhere they could.  Abortion was newly on the minds of Catholics following the papal decree *Humanae vitae*, which sought to ban the ""consensus of conscience"" between Catholic women, God,and their confessors on matters of family planning. Nixon is typically credited as the first politician to attempt to lure voters with a ""sanctity of life"" argument against abortion. But even as more rigorous Catholics tended to oppose abortion on theological grounds, other issues continued to drive dominant Catholic voting patterns, not least of all related to the Catholic emphasis on scripture as well as tradition, and individual conscience as well as canon law.  If workaday Catholics weren't yet paying attention, certain politically conservative evangelical leaders *were*. They recognized that they had precisely the voting bloc so sought by their political allegience on a moral and intellectual lockdown. ""Biblical inerrancy,"" the idea that the Bible says one thing and it's what your pastor teaches you to proof-text, was an eager partner to a ""sanctity of life argument."" The modern academic reads ""Before you were in your mother's womb, I knew you"" as a hellenized Jewish text and thinks, THE PLATO, IT BURNS. The evangelical Christian takes it on its own as says, ""God said it; I believe it; that settles it."" At the end of the 1970s, abortion shifted diametrically from that thing those Catholics (hardly Christian! in the evangelical mindset of the time) didn't like, to the driving belief of a large portion of Americans. Abortion, according to the guided-by-proper-authority interpretation of the text they believed was the One True Textbook Of All Subjects, was murder.  This biblical hermeneutic and the necessary orientation of a sect that organizes its philosophy around it, has driven the dominant evangelical/conservative political agenda in its more recent permutations. Same-sex marriage as a political issue is largely a violation of the 20 year rule (protease inhibitors for AIDS had barely been introduced by 1997; Willow and Tara didn't kiss until 2001 although Carol and Susan got married in 1996). Global warming/climate change has is also not really for AH discussion, but you can see the same anti-science, anti-intellectual ideas in the creationism/ID/evolution mixture evolving.   I stress, in the end, that you can't separate the biblical interpretation method from the authoritarian and reactionary mindset. They are mutually reinforcing. And in conservative Christianity in America, the warm and cozy certainty of authority and preservation of the lost past seen to have worked so well for so long had become cherished ideals. After all, who doesn't want to protect their kids and give them what they see as the best world?"
"Kosher in Judaism has different philosophical origins from religious fasting in Christianity. Kosher (and halal, for that matter) is about purity and community identity. Fasting is an ascetic practice, mastering control of the physical body as a spiritual feat. In the west, Christian fasting *barely* survives today in the form of the Catholic parish Fish Fry (and the current mild ""no meat on Fridays during Lent"" whence the tradition). But many eastern churches maintain rigorous fast days with exceptions for the sick, young, old, and pregnant."
"OP, this gives information about sectarian groups that, in general, try to live a life apart from society, at times explicitly ""in the world, but not of it"". What about conservative Christian groups that are more explicitly trying to remake the world in their image?  Margaret Mitchell (the well-known scholar of Ancient Christianity and former Dean of the Divinity School at the University of Chicago, not the author of *Gone with the Wind*) wrote a wonderful essay called ""[How Biblical is the Christian Right](https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/imce/pdfs/webforum/052006/how_biblical.pdf)?"" It's both insightful and just a fun read when thinking about what religion means in the US today.   She finds in the modern US politics the same thing she finds in 4th century Cappodachia: many people who claim to be literal are actually using figurative meanings depending on their rhetorical purposes, their audience, the text, etc.   She begins her esssy talking about how House Majority leader Tom DeLay quotes from the gospels in a way that, if we look closely at the plain reading of the passages, rather undermines his points instead of reinforcing. However,  >DeLay’s goal was not to make exegetical or theological sense. It was to declare affiliation with a certain brand of American Christianity.  Her essay is full of insights, but one of them is that the Bible is frequently not the text but the subtext of these conversations: the topics these groups emphasize in their public face, as you seem to suspect, seem to be chosen somewhat independently of the emphases of the Biblical text. On these groups' webpages,  >The upper left hand is usually reserved for a donation screen, but then the rest of the left hand menu almost invariably lists the links to such topics as Abortion, Guns, School Prayer, Homosexuality, Persecution, etc. *The Bible is usually not one of them*. It is deliberately submerged; one need not be a poststructuralist to recognize a sub-text, a hypo-text of the hyper-text. [...]On average it takes two or three and sometimes more links even to find a page that mentions the Bible or a biblical verse.   She continues (and remember, a lot of her essay is on the topic of Biblical literalism):  >“The Christian world-view,” which is being promoted by a whole range of home-schooling and other cottage industries, is a code-phrase for “Christianity in our likeness.” Here from a link on the Dobson web site: “What is a biblical worldview? A biblical worldview is based on the infallible Word of God. When you believe the Bible is entirely true, then you allow it to be the foundation of everything you say and do. That means, for instance, you take seriously the mandate in Romans 13 to honor the governing authorities by researching the candidates and issues, making voting a priority.” Why is Romans 13 rather than the Beatitudes to be the center of the Christian solar system? As I shall argue below, along with a polemical intent similar to what we see in ancient commentators, *what most characterizes the Christian Right’s biblical interpretation is no single method, but rather its selection of passages and topics.*  For me, her discussion of the websites' condemnation of gambling is most interesting because the Bible doesn't really have very much to say about gambling. As for the selective, single-minded, and  indeed misleading readings of other topics, Mitchell doesn't mince words:  >While it is easy to think of this as a literalistic proof-texting, it is not just that, but a highly creative rearrangement of selective pieces of the biblical record to justify a previously reached conclusion (in this case, apparently, the invasion of Iraq). Sometimes Land does include passages that might complicate the picture, but his own interpretive comments draw attention away from them. For example, we read “Rom. 12:2 our ways are separate from the world’s ways,” but would hardly realize that under the listing Rom. 12:17-21 lies a text that contains both the actual word peace (Rom. 12:2 does not) and a command related to it: “if it is possible by your agency, live in peace with all people” (Rom. 12:18). It bears noting, in relation to my larger thesis, that it is Christian peace-makers of various stripes—not the Christian Right—who are the literalists when it comes to the latter verse.  Now, I don't think Mitchell's point is that those on the Christian Right don't read their Bibles at all but rather, 1) people on all sides are much too quick to grant them their claimed title of Biblical literalists, 2) they engage in a variety of hermeneutic strategies, not merely literal interpretation of the plain text, 3) at least some of their judgements and analyses are driven by current conservative societal and political norms, rather than emulation of Biblical example.   >My thesis is that what makes the Christian Right biblical is not a literalistic hermeneutic so much as a mode of argumentation by reference to a deliberately selective set of biblical passages, annexed to the predetermined cause through a variety of exegetical moves, which are usually unexplained because they depend upon prior agreement of the ends of interpretation. And I have shown examples where there is a lot less biblical study going on than one might expect. The Christian Right represents biblical interpretation in a conjunction of two selective circles: of what are the key issues in the political realm and what are the central passages in the biblical record. It represents an odd alignment of each. The canonical delineation is striking—a focus on the Old Testament, with special prominence given to Judges and 1 and 2 Chronicles, as well as to Genesis and Leviticus; and in the New Testament, to selected moralizing passages of the Pauline letters and Revelation. It is easy to see then what is missing: the prophets of Israel and the teachings of Jesus (the Gospels). Along with them go concern with social/political issues such as economic inequality, peace-making, love and forgiveness, and critique of religious hypocrisy (just to choose a few!).  This, of course, only represents one part of contemporary Protestant Christianity (albeit likely the part most associated with the two issue you mention above). There are certainly other Christian groups--smaller and less publicly oriented--which, like /u/randomiblis says, emphasize a very different set of Biblical passages: Anabaptists, Hutterites, Quakers, for instance, seem to emphasize the Gospels and Acts much more strongly than the American Christian Right (the Hutterites, for instance, practice a ""community of goods"" and own almost no private property, in direct emulation of Acts 2:44-47, 4:32-35, and the other groups form the core of the [historic Peace Churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_churches) who found in the Gospels commendents for complete pacificism).  Preachers coming out of the politically engaged Black Protestant tradition, on the other hand, are much more likely to echo the calls for justice and fairness found in the Prophets than either the sectarian Christians or the Religious Right (""But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!"" Amos 4:24). I once went to a Syriac Easter service in Midyat, Turkey where all the women dutifully covered their heads with gauzy, ethereal veils in accordance with pretty clear instructions of 1 Corinthians 11:4-6 (as soon as they stepped out of the church, they uncovered their heads so as not to be confused with local Arab and Kurdish Muslims).    Certain ""snake handling"" Holiness sects in Appalachia such as Church of God with Signs in Appalachia have chosen to take as their core lines like Acts 28:1-6 and Mark 16:17-18 (""And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.""). Others in the Pentecostal/Holiness movements emphasize more only the casting out devils, speaking in new tongues, and laying hands on the sick without the handling serpents or ingesting poison. Interestingly, as literal as these groups take those lines, they don't always take other lines quite as literally, and for instance most of these groups that I know about allow divorce and remarriage despite pretty clear New Testament arguments against it (""To the married I give this command [not I, but the Lord]: A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife."" 1 Corinthians 7:10-11, ""For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man,"" Roman 7:2-3, ""He answered, 'Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.  And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.' Mark 10:11-12, etc. the best Christian justification of divorce is also here, as Jesus acknowledges that *Mosaic* law allows for divorce because of the ""hardness of [the Pharisee's] hearts"", even as he's clearly arguing against that, cf. Matthew 5:31-32). All groups at the very least must choose which parts of the Biblical corpus to emphasize."
"Exactly the Orthodox ones. Orthodox fasts can be quite rigorous. For much of Lent, for example, most Orthodox churches allow no meat, no dairy, no fish (basically no seafood with a backbone), no alcohol, and no oil. Some of the stricter fast days are limited to boiled vegetables with no seasoning. Furthermore, you're generally supposed to avoid eating before partaking of the Eucharist, so no food between dinner on Saturday night and the liturgy on Sunday morning.  But, as /u/sunagainstgold said, these are ascetic practices, and they're *not* analogous to dietary laws in Judaism or Islam. There is no significant focus on ""purity"" in Christian fasting. Fasting is about gaining control over one's desires so they can be directed towards productive spiritual ends, and so that one can resist temptations that prey on desire."
"In 1801, James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston (the R. also stood for Robert, oddly enough) were sent to Paris not to buy the enormous swath of land subsequently called the Louisiana Purchase but to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, thereby securing the lucrative Mississippi River shipping route. Negotiations fell through, and it wasn't until Livingston returned in 1803 that Napoleon was so hard-up on cash due to the continent-wide war of conquest he was waging that he was willing to make a deal with the Americans. At the time, Livingston was authorized by Jefferson to spend up to $9 million in order to purchase New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi. Since the US was planning on making a significant purchase from France, the delegation (Monroe rejoined Livingston in Paris shortly thereafter) travelled to Paris with $3 million in gold. In 1803,[gold was worth just under $20 an ounce](http://onlygold.com/Info/Historical-Gold-Prices.asp), which means they were travelling with almost 10,000 lbs of gold. This wasn't even remotely close to the carrying capacity of freighters of the time. [""Tea Clipper"" Frigates of that time could carry twenty times that weight.](http://www.tea.co.uk/tea-clippers).  Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million. Livingston and Monroe were authorized by Jefferson to spend up to 9 million on New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi, so when given this offer, they had to make a decision without the President's approval, and just couldn't pass up the deal. Oddly enough, I just read the chapter describing the negotiations in Stephen Clarke's very entertaining *1000 Years of Annoying the French*.  According to Clarke, the purchase was paid for with the above-mentioned 3 million in gold as a down payment, with the cancelling of 3.75 million in debt that France owed to the US for French piracy on American ships since the revolution, and the rest was issued in bonds. Again from Clarke:  >French Banks were too nervous to accept the bonds, and two foreign banks had to step in to provide the cash. The first was Hope and Company,  a bank based in Amsterdam but set up by Scotsmen. The second was a London bank, Barings. Napoleon was in such dire straits that he agreed to sell the bonds to the banks at a 12.5% discount.   I hope this answers your question sufficiently! "
That's seriously fascinating. I know that national debt is a bit different from personal debt, but would Napoleon have been hesitant to accept debt forgiveness as payment, seeing as how he was strapped for cash? Would that have been good as cash to him? Or is national debt not much of a concern when you're invading the continent?
Wasn't Napoleon warring with England at the time? Why would an English bank provide financial aid to an enemy nation? 
What was the president's reaction when he heard what had happened?
> Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million.  Note also a change between 1801 and early 1803 was the French Reconquest of Haiti went sour.   Haiti was before the revolution there, the crown jewel of the Caribbean, with Sugar, Coffee, and Indigo plantations a major profit center.   Haiti was also a massive slave state, with something like 80+ % of the island being slaves, with the majority of the slaves being first generation slaves born free in Africa and sold into slavery. The French revolution inspired revolutionaries in Haiti, and a general slave rebellion.   The course of the Haitian revolution was many sided, with everything from attempts at taking the colony by the British and the Spanish, to the local white population attempting to rule as a republic, to the government of André Rigaud and Louverture's victory. Louverture had control of Haiti by 1801, declaring himself Governor General for Life. Louverture and the French were suppose to be on the same side, but Napolean was gradually reinstating slavery in other French Colonies, making it clear that was the plan for Haiti. Louverture invaded the Spanish side of the island, and passed a Constitution which made Haiti effectively independent.  In 1802, Napolean's brother in law Leclerc lead an expedition of ~31k troops to retake Haiti and restore the plantations. The French had a lighting campaign that retook the cities and major agricultural areas.  But there's been more than a decade of slave revolts and fighting. The irrigation works were destroyed, the vast majority of plantation either left untended, or turned to producing food. The crown jewel of colonies was no more. There were some plantations that survived, here and there, but the river of sugar was but a trickle.   On top of that, the same thing that suppressed English and Spanish attempts to seize Haiti hit the French troops. Yellow Fever resulted in something like 20K+ of the expedition's forces dying. Including Leclerc dying in November 1802, and driving Pauline Bonaparte back to France, landing New Years day 1803.   So by 1803 Napoleon had no real purpose for New Orleans, as Haiti would no longer be a base to build a New World Empire, nor would the wealth of Haiti fill his coffers. War with England loomed, and the British would just take New Orleans.   Selling it all to the Americans would wash his hands of the whole thing. 
Just as a  side note for the interested, gold has a density of 19.32 grams/cubic centimeter. That means that 10,000 lbs of gold, by volume, is about 8 1/3 cubic feet or 0.43 cubic meters.  So that may help give you a mental image of the amount of gold we are talking here.    I'm curious what form it would have taken.  Bars?
Just a follow up question what was Europe's reaction to this purchase? Britain and her remaining allies could not have been happy with America simply giving France 15 million and thus giving France more monetary resources to wage war against them.
There was actually a period of peace, known as the Peace of Amiens, as it was a result of the Treaty of Amiens, from the end of the 2nd Coalition in March 1802 until May 1803. By March 1803, it was already very clear that war was back on the cards very soon. The negotiations were wrapped up in late April IIRC,  a few short week before the resumption of war in May 1803.  Had the American delegates arrived a couple of weeks later, or the negotiations been protracted, the involvement of a British institution in the transaction may have proven rather more tricky.
The bonds Napoleon sold the bank were financing the Louisiana purchase, which was handled through the previously mentioned Scottish bank (Hope & Co., btw). The purchase meant eradicating the native population (Native Americans) and importing and expanding the slave trade which both Barings and Hope were involved in financing for powerful British and Dutch merchants.  In other words, it was a once-in-a-lifetime awesome deal for the banks to finance the biggest land deal in history with an astonishing rate of interest and return and that would continue to prime the bank's pumps for decades.   All of this while completely blessed by the British, French, Dutch and American governments.
That's astonishing. A delayed ship due to poor weather, or some other delaying event, and the whole Louisiana purchase might not have happened.  Thank you for your work in answering this. Do you know if Napoleon tried to sell the land west of the Mississippi River to anyone else?
Today the British government would prohibit an English bank from assisting a belligerent country.   Do you know if the government had that same power back in the early 19th century, or could a determined English bank transact with a belligerent country back then?
A word of warning, noble sir. I believe your intentions with regard to the Cimmerians and Scythians are just - they need to feel the yoke of civilization. But when the topic of invading their land is raised, there is reference only to the attempts of peoples like the Swedes and the Germans. These were not the first to try their hand at it. Many centuries earlier, Cyrus, Great King, King of Babylon, King of the Four Corners of the Earth, King of the Universe, also invaded the land of the Scythians, but he came to a bad end, and his expedition floundered. Then a few generations later, my lord and uncle, Darius, invaded again, marching through Thrace and across the Danube with all the peoples over which he ruled. But the Scythians - uncivilised liars all - refused to engage him in battle. They left their land desolate and retreated, again and again, until my lord Darius' supplies were depleted, and he was forced to withdraw.^1 Many were killed in the retreat, preyed upon by the mounted archers of the enemy. While Darius obviously conquered the place, since no one resisted him, it was a bit harder to enforce the demands of the Great King once the army had left their lands. This was a blemish on the otherwise glorious career of Darius, conqueror of Thrace and Naxos and Euboea and vanquisher of the rebellious cities of the Yauna that dwell by the sea.  1. Herodotus 4.120-142
>Emperor of all Europe  Tsk tsk, please. This is the *real* Emperor of Europe speaking. I fought the French, Moors, and Heretics all simultaneously at the same time. You couldn't even handle the English. When you are ready to graduate from your boring and linear warfare, call me. 
Would it kill you to wait, I dunno, 5 or 6 years? You're emperor for life, your people love you, you should let them get busy and get your numbers back up. No need to keep going endlessly.
Look, I don't mean to alarm you but you may not have noticed that Russia is **FAR**.  I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the apothecary but that's just peanuts to Russia.  Listen, it's nearly 2500 kilometers from Paris to Moscow.  That's a long walk, doubly so in the mud, triply so lugging a cannon.    My advice: leave Russia to the Russians.  What are you gonna get out of Russia anyway?  Serfs?  Frozen ports?  Nuts to that noise, your Majesty.  What you need to do is cut your losses in San Domingo, make nice with the Americans, set up a permanent French agricultural colony up the Mississippi, and convince the Russians that they need to worry about the Chinese.
"There is one here every week, isn't there?   *Mods, I know that you frown on personal anecdotes, but please bear with me here.*   So, OP. I'm quite sure you won't believe me, but if you invade Russia, *you will have a bad time*. Don't believe me? Well, if you try to grab that bear by the nose ring, you're going to have to face the following:  * Your baggage train is going to be *long*. You think you know a thing or two about baggage trains? You know squat once you try to stretch one to there and back, and I started off a lot closer than you did. You should be happy if you even have it when you get there, which you won't.  * That said, since you'll be living without a supply chain, you'll be living off the land. This will *not* make the general populace happy where you pass through, not to mention the raping and killing that your horde will commit on the march. That walk home is going to be a lot longer when you have gangs of roving partisans picking your army to pieces.  * *""Oh, but I won't need a long baggage train, I'll win a decisive battle!""* I hear you say? No, you won't, that's not how the Russians roll. They'll fight you when they're good and ready.  * Do you even have an escape plan? I was lucky and had a buddy down south I could hide out with for a few years when everything went pear shaped.  * Not sure from your post if you're planning on hiring any Cossacks. My tip: don't. Using Cossacks always ends badly. Cossacks suck.   So to summarize, I know you've just spanked a ton of Germans, you've routed the Russians a bit, you have the finest infantry there ever was, your army fancies you a minor deity, and you're feeling like the king of the world. I know, because I've been there, done that, ate the Semla. Literally all of it. I can see the road you're headed down though, and unless you change course, reality is going to hit you like a bullet to the side of the head. "
I would strongly recommend against it.
Intriguing Scythian allegory, but there is a key difference between me and Cyrus.   For one, I am Emperor of France, which is even better than being King of the Universe.   Secondly, I respect the Russians, and that is why I want to conquer them. They deserve me as their ruler. I would not want to rule barbarians, not for very long.  And finally, though they are inferior to our superior Mediterranean civilization, they are indeed civilized, and that is exactly why I expect them to surrender in 20 days when I demolish their army.  Soldiers, the second war of Poland is started; the first finished in Tilsit. In Tilsit, Russia swore eternal alliance in France and war in England. It violates its oaths today. Russia is pulled by its fate; its destinies must be achieved! Does it thus believe us degenerated? Thus let us go ahead; let us pass Neman River, carry the war on its territory. The second war of Poland will be glorious with the French Armies like the first one.
I think you two need to have an epic rap battle
Oh come on. It's only going to take 20 days to defeat Russia. Then Europe can remain in peace, under my rule.
Sir please use our Emperor's measurements when you calculate distance so that would be 1,250,000 Toise.

BE GONE YOU IMPOSTEUR! GENDARME! GENDARME! ARREST THIS FOOL!
To be clear, the Emperor has not yet sold the territory in question to the United States; those are French fur trapping lands.  I'm sure Mr Jefferson, obvious constitutional crisis notwithstanding, would love to submit a bid but that's another matter
Yet again, this false Emperor over an Empire that is neither, as the venerable Voltaire has said, is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire. Even I wasn't so foolish to call myself a Roman Emperor, I only emulated them!
No, in medieval Europe,  there were no restrictions on common soldiers killing a king or any other aristocrats. If soldiers were able to identify a particularly important individual, there would probably have been a mad scramble to capture him rather than kill him outright, both for political purposes and for the potential for ransom profits. This happened to the French king Jean II at Poitiers, who was taken prisoner in a furious melee where other high-ranking French aristocrats, who ordinarily would have made excellent ransoms, were killed (possibly by accident as English troops swarmed to grab Jean specifically). When kings were killed outright in combat, it does not seem to have been a particular mark of controversy. John the Blind, King of Bohemia, died at Crecy but his killer was not specifically identified in accounts of the battle and the story of his death is conveyed merely as an illustration of John's bravery and valiant nature. Kings who fought did so in the full knowledge that they were at risk of being killed or captured at the battlefield.  English military contracts from the Hundred Years War suggest that there was no stigma attached to a common soldier capturing important aristocrats; they often contained clauses saying that any particular important prisoners (like a prince or something) would be handed over to the king in exchange for a cash payment. This worked to both parties'  advantage: common soldiers would probably not be be financially able to house and feed a prisoner (especially a royal prisoner) during the period in which the ransom was negotiated and paid. If there was any limitation on killing aristocrats, it would be that troops wanted to maximize their profit by taking nobles alive for ransom. This is most apparent in the hesitation of some English troops to kill their prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt. This incident is often taken as some kind of commentary on class relations, but in reality is just a reflection of soldiers looking out for their bottom line. 
Do you have a “where” or “when” to your question? You’re much more likely to get a satisfying answer if you include that in your post. 
As a follow up, how did the nobility fit into this hierarchy? It is my understanding that hostage/ransoming took place, but how extensive was this and how did one's social status fit into the realities of battle?
Was there any particular benefits given to a common soldier who captured a high ranking enemy, aside from a financial windfall? Did they gain any kind of authority or promotion, or was it just bragging rights?
Also, wasnt the killing of French noble prisoners at Agincourt a tactical concern because they could have rejoined the battle during a counterattack and overwhelmed the English rear?
It could happen, in theory. The man at arms Richard Waller was knighted at Agincourt for capturing the Duke of Orleans. But the average archer who captured an important figure would probably have just gotten a payout.  An archer named Robert Sadler captured a French knight at Agincourt named Edred de Droyle, whose ransom price was some 58 pounds and change, a significant sum for a common archer even after the required one third of his captain's share and one ninth share for King Henry V had been deducted. 
Yes, that was the reason for the killings. The battle seems to have been extremely chaotic in its middle stages, with large number of French troops arriving late to the fight and either joining in or running along with the masses of fleeing troops. Henry V ordered the prisoners to be killed rather than risk being overrun by a major attack from the French and a possible prisoner escape simultaneously. 
It would matter for many reasons, but mainly because the role and social status of a king is not the same throughout all cultures and periods. There are places where a king, while in a hereditary position of power, is expected to prove his legitimacy by participating in the duties of his subjects; there are other historical societies where kings were regarded as sacred conduits between humanity and the divine, or even as literal gods. There are places where kings act like a first among equals in council and war, places where they are considered above the day-to-day, and places where kings are altogether sequestered from public life and administrative responsibilities. The resulting degree to which kings were approachable by ordinary people, and participated in battle, is obviously very different. It would therefore be very helpful if /u/HiIsItMeYouRLooking4 could specify which period and area they are interested in.  Readers of this thread are reminded that we have a rule against [example-seeking questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22example_seeking.22_questions) as well as [casual or anecdotal answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). If you're just looking for some stories of kings in battle, feel free to post this question on r/history or r/AskHistory.
Royal participation in battle is a very common and normal thing in history. In many cultures, the main justification of a king's supreme power was his ability to protect his land and people. Martial prowess and military superiority was therefore often a key element of royal propaganda. A king who was perceived as weak or cowardly would find little support among his subjects.   Our earliest surviving description of a historical battle is Ramesses II's account of how well he fought at Qadesh; Pharaohs and Assyrian kings boasted of how many men they personally killed; the kings of Homer's *Iliad* fought until they were too old, and then they only talked about how much they had fought when they were younger. Persian kings led their armies in person; Spartan kings fought alongside their men, and at least 5 of them died in battle; the kings of Macedon, including Alexander the Great, were covered in scars sustained in combat. The Roman Emperors of the Principate (27 BC - AD 284) were army leaders first of all, though this was less true for the Emperors of Late Antiquity.   This very short and very incomplete list covers less than 2,000 years of history, and only for a small part of the world; I'm sure that we could go on forever if we included all eras and all continents.
Weirdly specific question: Was that one ninth taken from gross (before the captain’s share) or the net (after the captain’s share)?
I don't actually know, but I suspect it would be from the gross. Individual contracts might vary on the specific terms, but you can bet that the crown \*always\* got its cut. 
He didn't receive a full 58 pounds, but even the slightly-less-than-two-thirds he might have gotten were staggeringly high sums for an archer. The standard wage for an archer would have been 6 pence per day (and archers probably would not serve for a full 365 days of a calendar year). So even two thirds of 58 pounds would definitely have been enough for Mr. Sadler here to buy his own armor and serve in the next campaign as a man-at-arms, if he so chose, or to buy his own business and set himself up handsomely. 
"Well, the answer is unfortunately not that satisfying, but I expect that you came into this question realizing it was a somewhat vain hope given the use of ""disappeared from history"". To provide a little background, Sally Hemmings had a number of children, some of whom died in infancy, which are generally accepted as being fathered by Thomas Jefferson (I would direct to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6aqa2e/panel_ama_slaves_and_slavers/dhj0rqm/?context=2) for more discussion, broadly, of the sexual relationships between masters and slaves in the antebellum South). Whether or not this was fact has been debated since before Jefferson himself died, and scholarly opinion has swayed about, but it is pretty much now the consensus.  Anyways though. Harriet, described as ""nearly as white as anybody and very beautiful"" had no trouble passing for white, and as you already are aware, made use of this. She was freed in 1822 at the age of 21, apparently on a promise Jefferson had made to Sally Hemings to do so when the children reached that age. The documentation of Harriet's liberation is almost next to nothing. Edmund Bacon, who worked as an overseer at Monticello, described her departure, being the one who gave her the $50 that you mention, and stating she had been headed for Philadelphia. And as for her life after she headed north, we only have one account which we can give any real credence to, that from her brother Madison, who wrote in 1873:  >Harriet married a white man in good standing in Washington City, whose name I could give, but will not, for prudential reason. She raised a family of children, and so far as I know they were never suspected of being tainted with African blood in the community where she lived or lives. I have not heard from her for ten years, and do not know whether she is dead or alive. She thought it to her interest, on going to Washington, to assume the role of a white woman, and but her dress and conduct as such I am not aware that her identity as Harriet Hemings of Monticello has ever been discovered.   Washington City in this case refers to the District of Columbia as it was then known, and it would appear that while she kept a low profile, she did not choose to cut all ties with her family, at least immediately, as Madison claims to have remained in contact with her through the 1860s (he was writing in 1873). He also gives us reason to believe it quite possible that she has living descendants, but of course was much to guarded to allow any information to get out which could give much of a thread to follow. What the end of communications even meant is up in the air - perhaps she decided to cut her final tie to non-white society, or perhaps she simply died. We can only speculate. But in any case, Madison's account is the lone source we can rely on to reconstruct any sense of her post-emancipation life.  She was not the only child of Jefferson and Hemmings to follow such a route. While Madison and Eston both left records, writings, and known descendants, their brother Beverley was similarly allowed to leave Monticello for the North, and even less seems sure about his fate then his sister, doing a similar disappearing act but without, it seems, even the record of correspondence that Harriet left He was briefly in contact, long enough to communicate back that he had married a white woman and that they had a daughter, living in Washington City, but that seems to be the end of it. In both the case of Beverley and Harriet, it should be noted, Jefferson *officially* recorded them as being escaped slaves, as their departure was recorded in the 'farm book', but it was quite clearly allowed with his approval as a means of sending them North in technical compliance with the aforementioned agreement he had made with Sally. The backhanded means of liberation is thought to have been a means of following through without providing ammunition for those looking to prove the parentage.  Now, as to the second part of your question, you might perhaps want to x-post to /r/AskScience as it is less a history question that one for a geneticist. What I do understand of these things would imply that it is possible to find genetic matches that show relations by various degrees, but it isn't like those genes are signed ""T.J."" Establishing who that common ancestor is takes a lot more leg work. To compare to the famous claim about Genghis Khan's widespread DNA, this is based on finding the the same Y-chromosome (which records patrilineal descent) in millions of people that shows they share a common male ancestor a certain period back in time. Genghis Khan is then assumed to be the one based on historical circumstances. But I would hesitate to say more, as again, this is getting into the territory for a scientist to discuss.

This is fascinating!  So I'm just wondering, do we have any idea how common it was for slaveholders during this time to free their mixed race children this way?
I actually touch on this a bit in the [earlier answer I linked to](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6aqa2e/panel_ama_slaves_and_slavers/dhj0rqm/?context=2), but to briefly rehash, the treatment varied greatly. Some masters would give no acknowledgement of their enslaved children, and treat them no different, while others were willing to give different levels of acknowledgement. Equal, or near equal, treatment was decidedly *not* the rule, but at least some level of preferential treatment was seen often enough. I don't believe anyone has done any sort of statistical calculation there for us to quantify how common specific approaches were though, but there are plenty of one off examples found in the records.
"I wonder how many were freed or alllowed to ""run away"" because they simply just looked too white, and it was an obvious embarrassment to have to all appearances white slaves working on your plantation. "
"I've actually written a bit about this before. I only touch briefly on the specific issue of black persons light skinned enough to ""pass"". which *definitely* caused concerns with moralists of the time, and am more focused on vitiligo/albinism and the threat those conditions posed for ideas of race, but [I think it will be of interest!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6iekfb/what_happened_to_slaves_with_vitiligo_in_the_us/dj5wlk5/)"
Here’s the thing—you recognize mixed heritage appearance that is *visible*. You are not spotting the “mixed” persons who look light enough to pass and guaranteed there are some around you at any given time. They may not be “passing” in the old sense—they may identify as black or Mixed race but you don’t know it because they aren’t wearing a tee shirt proclaiming it or anything. Others may be the descendants of people who successfully passed for white—so successfully that their descendants have no idea they are not 100% white.   People like to say that mixed race is always “obvious” or they can always spot it but there is no telling how many people you assume are white are actually mixed.  [This ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2017/11/20/my-mother-spent-her-life-passing-as-white-discovering-her-secret-changed-my-view-of-race-and-myself/) is an excellent piece that was recently in the Washington Post that really made me think about this more than I had previously. It’s by a woman who discovered as an adult that her mother had been “passing” and her white father had never known it. Her mother refused to talk about it and after her death the author went on the PBS show “Genealogy Roadshow” to get help in tracking down her mon’s story and her unknown relatives. The author of the piece also has a book out and I am looking forward to reading it.  I mention this because you can see from the pictures in the article that the author herself, who has a “black” mother and has been reunited with clearly African American relatives, looks absolutely white and any casual observer would never even consider the possibility that she might be mixed race.
"Its pretty late so I need to turn in, but just a few very quick notes. I wouldn't want to give the impression that no one cared about it. *Certainly* people cared if it was a white woman with a black man (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6fy8j4/there_are_lots_of_stories_of_white_slaveowning/dimmofu/)), and there were social conventions, spoken and unspoken, that a white man would be expected to follow as well, and flouting them could have negative social consequences. So I think the way to put it is that people weren't too concerned with ""miscegenation"" as long as it was conducted in a way that didn't upset the social order. You certainly see times where this was not followed that it *was* an issue, especially when white men recognized their bi-racial children in ways that white society didn't approve.  As for the post-war period, unfortunately, my readings focus very much on the antebellum South. I can discuss bits and pieces beyond, but hopefully someone else can jump in here to discuss the approach in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. You may want to post it as its own question though for better results."
"Let's start with beef, since the patty is the easiest part here, and also the most important part of the burger. The romans absolutely had beef. There are dozens of references to beef throughout greek and roman literature. In the odyssey, Odysseus kills some sacred cattle, and cooks the meat. I'm sure that in a big city like rome, it would be easy to come across some beef. Grinding beef by hand might be hard, but I'm sure our McRoman can pull it off, considering his need for a delicious burger. You can do that with a decent knife, but it'll be an absolute pain.   Next, we need cheese. Pliny, in his *Natural History* (XI, 96-97) talks about cheese. In chapter 97, he lists off a bunch of kinds of cheese, but what sounds good to me is his comment that ""Goats also produce a cheese which has been of late held in the highest esteem, its flavour being heightened by smoking it."" Smoked goat cheese would be nice on a burger, if a little off from traditional McDonalds.   Our greens are next. Onion is also mentioned in Pliny's text. IN book XIX, chapter 32, Pliny talks about onions. He mentions a few varieties of onions. The onions of Crete are known for ""the sweetness of their flavour."" Sweet onion is my preferred burger onion, so let's hope our McRoman can find that. However, he can certainly find some kind of onion. We're doing good!  Now for Lettuce. Once again, we're in luck! The romans ate lots of lettuce, and once again, Pliny has us covered. Chapter 38 of the same book is all about lettuce. He describes a bunch of lettuces, including one so large it could be used for a small garden gate! The footnotes in the translation seem to indicate this might be Sessile, or romaine lettuce, so we'll go with that. However, any lettuce will do here, so let's not worry too much about that. We got lettuce!   Pliny disappoints here with pickles. Despite devoting Chapters 2 - 5 of Book 20 to cucumbers as a medicine, and chapter 23 of book XIX to cucumbers as something to grow in your garden, Pliny doesn't actually mention that you can pickle cucumbers anywhere I saw. Columella' *de re rustica* (on agriculture), however, does. He states that you mix up ""hard brine,"" which is heavily saturated saltwater, and vinegar (which was made from wine and spices), and then you add cucumbers and all kinds of other stuff. Your pickles will be giving your burger a real funky taste.   Mustard seed is also mentioned in Pliny. Apicus mentions mustard as well, and wants everyone to use it all the time. I didn't feel like crawling through more translations for all this, so I just went out and found someone else's adaptation of Apicus's mustard recipe. I linked it down below. The recipe is going to make a stone ground, strong flavored mustard. It's got some whole seeds, and is probably closest to modern brown mustard. This is strong artisanal stuff, so again with the funky taste and strong burger.   Bread is going to be expensive at the least. Modern flour is of great quality, historically speaking. Only the finest flour would have been fine and white. Off in Book XVIII, Chapter 26, Pliny talks about bread and risen bread. He says that ""At the present day, however, the leaven is prepared from the meal that is used for making the bread. For this purpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt, and is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left till it begins to turn sour."" That's sourdough - they have a starter culture, and then they would use it. It's not fed and kept like a modern sourdough culture, but it is decent starter yeast. The flavor from it will be inconsistent, and you'll probably have some grit from the grinding, but if your McRoman shills out all the cash he can, he'll get decent sourdough bread. This will not be a neutral flavored bun, and it's not going to look great. But you could buy some sort of small loaf at a bakery, so at least we have a bun.   Sesame seeds are also not the hardest. It's an old crop, and a quick search pulled up a JSTOR result on how the ""seed was well known to ancient greek and roman authors."" I'm sure our Ronald McRoman could walk on down to the market and buy a little thing of sesame seeds if needed. So he just needs to pay the baker to put a bunch of sesame seeds on the nicest small loaf he has before he bakes it. Easy peasy!  The romans would have had frying pans and griddles. The Royal Ontario museum of archeology has an article they published in the American Journal of Archaeology, which I found reproduced on The University of Chicago's website. It includes a number of illustrations of Frying pans and Griddles. They look not bad for frying.   In summary: Yes. we're going to burger town. But it's going to be gourmet, and not what we're used to. The biggest issue will be the beef, which is going to be a pain to butcher into ground beef. But it won't be that off from what you might get in a fancy hipster restaurant. I dunno how much this might all cost, sorry.

Oh snap, I'm late to the party on this one. Let's talk about some McCaesar's, shall we?   First, let's discuss the basic components of a cheeseburger and what those entail. Some of the modern stuff ([like heavily sugared buns](https://yourquestions.mcdonalds.ca/answer/how-much-sugar-in-a-bun/)), we'll obviously pass over, but we *will* be talking about what our ancient cheeseburger will taste like - and how it'd probably be pretty damn delicious, but with a bit of Roman flair.   So most basic of the basic ingredients:  * buns   * cheese  * beef patty (possibly two if you're like me and eat more than your body weight in a day I mean what)   * salt and pepper    However, if you just make a burger with those things, it's going to be a boring burger. What makes the burger delicious isn't just its beef and cheese, but its toppings. Today, those include ketchup, mustard, mayo, and, oftentimes, some sort of mystery sauce. The Romans didn't have access to tomatoes, so we'll go ahead and skip that one, but not only can we get everything else, I think we can replace the ketchup and still have things taste just fine. Some other toppings'n'stuff are tomato (again), lettuce, onion, butter, and garlic (powder, used for seasoning).   But we don't want any old McDonald's burger - [we want a *real* burger.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM_KMYulI_s). So can we make Gordon Ramsay happy with readily available ingredients in Rome? I'm gonna go ahead and say absolutely.   First off, I'm gonna go ahead and start with a quote from Cato the Elder who, among being a cantankerous old coot who liked hating on Carthage, [wrote an entire book about how great cabbage is](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/K*.html), as well as giving us this delightful quote:  > “Of this last kind of comparisons is that quoted from the elder Cato, who, when asked what was the most profitable thing to be done on an estate, replied, “To feed cattle well.” “What second best?” “To feed cattle moderately well.” “What third best?” “To feed cattle, though but poorly.” “What fourth best?” “To plough the land.” And when he who had made these inquiries asked, “What is to be said of making profit by usury?” Cato replied, “What is to be said of making profit by murder?”   (Cicero, *De Officiis*)  That is to say, the Romans loved beef and recognized the amount of money that could be made in the proper care and raising of cattle. While grain is what everyone talks about being mass produced for the Roman people, it was a poor man's food (as shown by the constant grain subsidies that were in place to feed the people of Rome, not to mention the actually massive shipments coming in from across the Mediterannean). But the beef was not only high quality ([I'll refer you to the non-cabbage related portions of Cato](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/home.html), written in the 2nd c. BCE), but it was certainly not a rare commodity. That being said, I'm not sure that the beef was particularly cheap - it's tough to nail down prices (and I'll see if I can do some side research into estimates for you, but since we don't even know for sure how much wheat cost....I'm digressing), but meat was meat, and the majority of Romans (the poor) did not have enough loose change to commit to it. That being said, other (more contemporary) authours talk about cows nonstop, and if you'd like to know more about cattle breeds, what they might have looked like, and what they were good for, I'd be happy to provide sources. For now, know that there were many, some were renowned for their meat, and some for their cheese.  And oh my, did the Romans love their cheeses. Cows are versatile creatures, and they offer a variety of substances that were useful for this endeavour - meat, cheese, and butter. Now, the Romans weren't themselves heavy users of butter (Apicius avoids it in all of his recipes, and the Romans themselves seem to have seen it as a weird German thing), preferring olive oil or other fats, but it was certainly theoretically available. If you can make a good cheese, you can make butter. So we can certainly check off the butter, the cheese (probably way better cheese than you'd get with most burgers, honestly), and the beef quite easily.  Salt is one of those things that everyone likes to misunderstand - there's a trope that the word *salary* came from the Roman soldiers being paid in salt, which has no real basis - but hey, the Romans themselves were unsure about where their word *salarium* came from. Either way, the Romans had salt, and they greedily held control over their salt supplies. One of those mines was at one of Rome's major ports in Ostia, giving easy access to the resource.   Pepper, on the other hand, is not a naturally occurring European resource. However, by 1 CE (thanks for that date, gives me the excuse to rant about Roman trade networks), trade with India was *booming*. After the subjugation of Egypt in 31 BCE, the Romans subsumed the Ptolemaic trade routes through the province, driving the previous levels of trade to a fever pitch, a trade explosion which continued for over 200 years. Where trade had previously been slow, with as few as twenty ships making the trip, the Romans used their military as a workforce to create the necessary infrastructure for intensifying trade with the East; over a hundred ships were soon making the annual journey to India.^1 Where enterprising merchants had previously only been able to travel at night, heavily stocked with water and in constant fear of banditry, the Romans built and fortified roads, water stations, and the trading cities themselves. Shipyards were built in an attempt to support the failed invasion of Arabia in 26 CE, which were easily converted to civilian use afterwards.^2 This large-scale rise in infrastructure created a fertile environment for a wave of consumerism to sweep the Roman world, with demand for Eastern luxuries and spices increasing dramatically among those with disposable income. Those imports ranged from places as far apart as Madagascar and Vietnam. The primary partner of Rome in this sea trade, however, was India. Trade ports ranged across the subcontinent, each one offering a different selection of trade goods, the most common of which was pepper.^3 Other imports included varied types of luxury wood, precious stones, frankincense and myrrh, and textiles such as cotton and silk. Indian imports quickly became central to Roman life, with recipes and medicines commonly using exotic spices, such as malabatrum or the especially unhelpfully described *“ispicam Indicam.”*  I've provided a few sources at the bottom for further reading on this, since there's honestly a vast wealth of information discussing Roman trade and how quickly and deeply it was tied to Rome - it quickly became *the* big business in the Roman empire, with individual shiploads being valued in the millions of *sestertii*. MacLaughlin's book is an excellent one, and Lytle is a magnificent researcher when it comes to near eastern trade (and ancient fishermen). But I digress.  By this time, pepper would have been readily available in multiple types, and wouldn't be too terrifically difficult to come by. Garlic, too, is a native herb to Europe, Asia, and beyond, and would not have been rare or even worth special commentary for its difficulty to find. Fear not, your beef patty will be perfectly seasoned, assuming that you're a decent chef and/or have access to YouTube so that you can do a quick search on Gordon Ramsay's burger. The onion, too, was incredibly popular in all sorts of things, from cooking to medicine, and your request to put onions on this concoction would have been met with approval from whomever you were commissioning. That and the fact that it wasn't hard to come by, so it would have been reasonably cheap. Overall, by the way, this burger probably would cost you a pretty penny. Probably not those 30 pieces of silver, but certainly something that you would see at an Epicurean feast.    
"A suitably motivated Roman could have cobbled together some approximation of the modern cheeseburger.  We must assume, first, that this Roman was wealthy enough to own a house with its own kitchen. The great majority of the city of Rome's inhabitants lived in insulae (apartment blocks) with rudimentary, if any, spaces for culinary preparation, and simply bought most of their hot food from the many ""fast food"" stalls lining the major streets.   But if our Roman had  a kitchen in which to prepare it, beef was available from butcher stalls in certain markets - an inscription mentions a *bubularius* (beef seller) near the Roman Forum (*AE* 1991, 287). It was probably customary for the butcher to have a few choice cuts prepared for customers (as seen in [this famous relief](http://romanancienthistory.blogspot.com/2016/02/famous-funerary-stele-of-roman-butcher.html)), and our hypothetical burger-loving Roman could easily purchase enough beef for a burger.   Since the Romans regularly ground meat for sausages, our Roman would have had no trouble grinding the beef and cooking it. In the collection of recipes traditionally attributed to Apicius, in fact, there actually is a recipe for *isicia omentata*, sometimes described as a proto-hamburger. The recipe, according to a rather antiquated online translation, is:  ""Finely cut pulp of pork is ground with the hearts of winter wheat and diluted with wine. Flavor lightly with pepper and broth and if you like add a moderate quantity of myrtle berries also crushed, and after you have added crushed nuts and pepper shape the forcemeat into small rolls, wrap these in caul \[that is, intestinal membrane\], fry, and serve with wine gravy.""  (2.1.7 - for a modern take on the recipe, see [this page](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/ethnic/historical/ant-rom-coll.html#3)).  Ground beef, in short, would have been no trouble.  Cheese was abundant, and sold from stalls throughout the city. Lettuce, grown in market gardens around Rome, was also easily available - Apicius has a whole chapter [devoted to lettuce-based recipes](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Apicius/3*.html#XVIII).   The Romans knew how to pickle vegetables (see [this chapter in Apicius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Apicius/1*.html#22)), but I'm not aware of any evidence that they regularly pickled cucumbers. Onions, however, were used in many dishes.   As for the bun - bread was of course widely available, and Apicius has a recipe for honey cookies with sesame seeds. I don't think, however, that the Romans regularly ate buns sprinkled with sesame seeds. "
It should be possible to procure all the major ingredients in some not-too-alien form. Beef, cheese, bread, sesames, salt, and lettuce were all available to a wealthy Roman. But there are some important economic considerations of this enterprise I’d like to address.   Price indexes are an attempt to characterize the price of many different goods into a single value. The reason why they are complex is that it is difficult to construct “reasonably” a relative weighting of many different things. Part of the reason the Economist proselytizes the virtues of its Big Mac Index is that it erases all the vagaries of finding compatible weights. It’s a way to cut the Gordian Knot of reconciling the differing index baskets of goods which are at least as plentiful as national statistics bureaus across the Earth.  When you inject 2000 years of economic transformation into this process, you strain the assumptions of this comparison strategy. The Roman Empire in 1AD was as highly monetized a society as existed on Earth, meaning a surprisingly large portion of economic transactions were conducted in money. But this was only a relative phenomenon. Large swaths of the population engaged in partial or total subsistence agriculture. Many transactions, especially among the poor, were conducted in barter or payment-in-kind. And a large portion of the labor force were slaves. So when you only watch “money” you are examining only a specific slice of total economic activity.   All these issues in the Roman Empire became much more serious after the inflationary problems of the Third Century and then the economic straight jacket of the Reforms of Diocletian. But even in 1AD looking at prices only tells you the cost weighting of only the relatively well off. (Especially if you consider that preferences really are not homothetic, but let’s not get too far gone into theory.) So while you could perhaps set your mind to constructing a Big Mac Index for the Roman Empire, you should keep in mind just how little it will tell you about their economic world.  Less important aside: the bun would be really hard to make. They had plenty of wheat, but modern refined flour is a fairly novel occurrence. They’d probably have to make something much more porous or much more dense.  If you want a relatively recent paper probing Roman prices, I’d suggest [this](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2011/retrieve.php?pdfid=219). It has a decent literature review, and covers many of the reason why this is such a hard question.
"Chef here. You've inspired me to make a from-scratch ""McRoman"" one day soon.  But to actually add something to this discussion, you could pretty easily make a close approximation to Big Mac sauce despite not having ""mayo"".   Using the ""funky"" pickles, Crete's sweet onions, Pliney's mustard, vinegar, garlic, and egg yolk you could absolutely make a sauce similar to McDonald's ""special sauce"". All ingredients that, as you detailed and sourced, are possibly obtainable in Rome in 1AD.   [Source for Garlic in Roman culture, specifically as food for the poor.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=allium)"
Great answer! But Odysseus DID NOT kill and eat the sacred cattle of Helios the sun god.  His men did, despite being ordered not to, because they choose to chance fate instead of starving while Odysseus was out scouting. All of them perish as a result, and the hero has to continue his Odyssey alone. 
The Romans had sausages right? How did they grind the meat for those?
"Anyway, there are a few things that we haven't covered yet, so I'll get to them right fast. Mayonnaise is easy as hell to whip together (and I highly recommend you make your own variants at home, it tastes *excellent*, assuming you have access to eggs and vinegar. Eggs were an extremely popular staple in the Roman world (In the above *De Agricultura*, Cato actually recommends them as medicine for cows at one point), so finding some eggs to not only bind your burger patty, but also make the mayo? No problem, that's just a quick trip to the marketplace. You got any preference for the type of eggs? Cause, assuming you're a fancypants Roman, you probably had many different preferences for egg types - quail, dove, ostrich....and yeah, chicken eggs were also available. But hey, you have options! The other main ingredient in mayo is oil which, as I mentioned before, the Romans (and Greeks) adored. Mustard's another major topping, and that one might be a little more fancy, but no less difficult to come by - it was so well known, in fact, [that some random illiterate peasant in a backwater Roman province is recorded as having used it as an illustration in an extended metaphor about morality.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Mustard_Seed) Mustard isn't too hard to make from the seed, and, since Rome had the aforementioned trade routes allowing the Spice to Flow, getting your hands on enough mustard seed would be reasonably unproblematic.   As a final sauce, the Romans, while not having ketchup, would probably default to *garum*, the fish sauce which they put on basically everything and had a ravenous appetite for. Now, while we're reasonably unsure as to what actually went *into* this sauce, we've got a couple of analogues. In the western world, one of the closest things you could probably use to approximate it would be the impossible-to-pronounce Worcestershire sauce - a substance which is often used with ubiquity, and which my own stepdad likes putting on his burgers. *Garum* would probably have been thicker, but again, we're not 100% on the details, other than the ""fermented fish sauce"" bit.  Let's finish off with that most basic ingredient that I definitely did not forget to cover! The buns! The Romans certainly knew how to make breads, both regular and sweet, and actually have a way to know the *exact* makeup of at least a cheap form of this bread. Archaeology.   Yep, you heard me, we have a legitimate loaf of bread that's survived since antiquity. Since 79 CE, to be precise. Probably sometime in October-November. How in the world can I date it so perfectly, you might ask? Why, dear reader, this loaf of bread was found at Pompeii. It's no longer edible, sure, but it's not so hard to sample the carbonized bread (not with your mouth, with a lab) and to figure out the exact makeup. [The British Museum even has a recipe and how-to video posted up](https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/pompeii_and_herculaneum/pompeii_live/live_event/bread_recipe.aspx). A sourdough bun doesn't sound half bad, and since the Romans definitely knew how to make smaller sizes of bread than large loafs, a bun wouldn't be extraordinary in the least.  The rest of your burger is just preparation, and considering that the Romans had dishes that haven't actually changed much in the past 2000 years ([here's a cast iron dutch oven](https://imgur.com/Qme5JVj)), the preparation wouldn't be a problem. I'm reasonably confident that, assuming you had the resources (i.e. wealth and a few slaves who knew where to shop), you could decide on a cheeseburger in the morning and have one for dinner. Hope that helps, and please let know if you have questions!  EDIT: forgot the pickles and the sesame seeds. The sesame seeds would be relatively easily imported from Egypt, while vinegar was a super common thing - it's just turned wine, and Roman soldiers basically drank wine that was all but vinegar. Add that to [cucumbers](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Natural_History_\(Rackham,_Jones,_%26_Eichholz\)/Book_20), and boom, pickles!   1: Strabo, Geography, 2.15.12.  2:  Strabo, Geography, 17.45.; MacLaughlin, R. *Rome and the Distant East: Trade Routes to the Ancient Lands of Arabia, India and China.* 28. 2011.   3: Lytle, E. “Early Greek and Latin Sources on the Indian Ocean and Eastern Africa,” in: G.

I know, I was just breezing through that because I was too focused on BURGER.
Wow this was a way better response than I could have ever hoped for! Thank you so much! I'm totally going to try making a McCaesar (as I'm now going to call it). Though I think instead of the garum I'll mix worchestershire sauce into the patties to get that deep flavor without having to try to make a thickened version. 
1492 happened - tomatoes are a New World crop and, as such, would have been completely unknown to the Romans, despite their desire to eat anything that they could get their hands on.
"The first week wasn't especially important but it was part of a very short arc that saw Hitler go from opposition political leader to absolute dictator in a series of steps.   The Depression in Germany splintered public opinion. This led to a very unstable legislature in where no one party could govern effectively. As a result, there was an increasing reliance on government by emergency decree by otherwise mainstream parties. This established norms for authoritarianism and anti-democratic behaviour but had little to do with the Nazis. They were just a growing opposition party at this point, seen as outside realistic voting options for most.   Hitler announced he would only seek power through elections in 1931, which helped solidify him as a viable political choice for the middle class, capitalists, military officers and other conservatives. Before that, Hitler and the Nazis were seen as ruffians outside the pale of good taste that appealed to angry violent yahoos.   Hitler came a strong second in the January 1932 Presidential election to Hindenburg, and remained leader of a large but not in any way dominant political party. The Nazis were one of numerous parties in a highly fractured legislature. More parliamentary elections were held in July and November of 1932 but there was no ability to form a majority government that was stable, and the minority administrations were rudderless.   After the November elections, a number of leading politicians and wealthy men appealed to President Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor in order to get stability. In January 1933, he came to power in a coalition with just three positions for the Nazis but critically, control of the police.   That first week wasn't especially profound. But Hitler quickly dissolved the legislature and called for new elections to be held in early March. I'm not sure if that was in the first week or not, but the calling of the elections wasn't especially crucial.   Feburary 27, 1933 was crucial: The Reichstag building was set on fire. A Communist was found inside in incriminating circumstances, accused of the crime by the Nazi policing minister and the resulting political crisis gave Hitler the excuse to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree. He suspended basic rights and allowed arrest without trial. Mass arrests of communists and political opponents were combined with political violence and intense anti-communist propaganda.   There is a near consensus that the fire was the work of that communist. There is a minority view that the Nazis had a role in setting the fire and framed the communists to give them the excuse to issue the decree and polarize the election against the communists. Either way, the fire gave Hitler the excuse to issue the decree and that was act that got him a dictatorship.   The Nazis came short of a majority in the election. To remedy this, they proposed legislation giving Hitler a 4 year temporary dictatorship. This required a super majority in the House, and they didn't have the votes. So the Nazis used the Reichstag Fire Decree powers and their control of the police to arrest the communist members of the legislature. They also detained some of the Social Democrats and physically intimidated others. They created so much chaos and intimidation, and took away so many opposition votes, that they made their bill viable.   On March 23, 1933, the Reichstag voted to grant Hitler those ""temporary"" powers to enact laws without the consent of the legislature. From here they expanded their campaign to outlawing the Social Democrats as well as the Communists, then dissolved all trade unions. Political opponents were sent to the concentration camps. By June, all other parties had been intimidated into disbanding.   The first week in power wasn't that important. But democracy was completely dissolved within five months of Hitler assuming office and Germany turned into a one-party state that jailed and murdered opponents.

"Eddie, I'd contend that what you should be paying attention to is an event that happened less than one month after Hitler was appointed chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933. I'm referring, of course, to [the Reichstag fire](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007657).  On Feb. 27, 1933, the German parliament building, the Reichstag, burned down.   This is a key moment in the rise of Nazi Germany and one of the points at which Germany shifts from the Weimar Republic to a totalitarian state.  The Reichstag had been the heart of democratic Germany, a representative body that ─ even in 1933 ─ still held the belief that it answered to the people, not the state. The Nazi party held a minority of seats in that body. It had even lost 34 seats in the November 1932 election while the Communist Party gained 11 (for a total of 100).   The Reichstag was by no means perfect. The Weimar government had shown its flaws, and the rise of Nazism had shown the Reichstag's conservative members to be willing to go along with the radical Nazis. The conservatives in the Reichstag believed Hitler was a buffoon, someone controllable even if he got into power as chancellor. They were not captivated by his speeches (in general) and believed he was less extreme than he actually was. With Hindenburg as president, the conservatives believed that Hitler would be checked, and the Nazis could be brought into the fold safely. Things worked out differently, of course.  When the fire took place, Hitler and his closest advisers saw that it was a golden opportunity. A young Dutch Communist had been arrested at the scene, and so they were quick to declare the fire an arson, a communist plot designed, as Goebbels wrote in his diary, ""to sow confusion in order, in the general panic, to grasp power for themselves.""  Many people have claimed in the years since the fire that it was entirely orchestrated by the Nazis as a pretext to seize power. Many others have claimed that there's little evidence of a conspiracy, and that the Nazi leadership was simply opportunistic. [Richard Evans' 2014 review of *Burning the Reichstag* is a wonderfully detailed breakdown of the arguments](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n09/richard-j-evans/the-conspiracists).   In the end, I'm not sure whether it matters all that much. In either case, the Nazis called the fire an act of terrorism, and in order to fight terrorism, they needed to improve security. In order to improve security, they needed new powers for the state, and they needed to make arrests. Nazi party members were enrolled as auxiliary policemen, and overnight they arrested hundreds ─ if not thousands ─ of communists and left-wing politicians and political organizers. Disregarding parliamentary immunity, the Nazis seized the leaders of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party.  The morning after the fire, the German cabinet ─ which, like the Reichstag, had a non-Nazi majority ─ drew up an emergency decree designed to ensure security. It abolished freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, legalized phone-tapping, suspended the freedom of some of the German states, and in general meant the end of free government in Germany.  Using the terrorist attack at the Reichstag as a pretext, the Nazis pushed through the emergency decree, which was signed by a wavering Hindenburg.   Now, with unprecedented power as Chancellor, Hitler was able to brow-beat his opponents. Less than a week after the emergency decree passed and the Nazis had been able to unleash a firestorm of violence against their opponents, a new federal election was held. The Nazis still tallied only 44 percent of the vote, despite their actions, but it was enough.  Two weeks after the election, the Nazis were able to gain enough votes from non-socialists to pass the Enabling Acts. These acts gave Hitler and his ministers exclusive legislative power. The president and the Reichstag were sidelined.  By the summer of 1933, all opposition was crushed. More than 100,000 people had been sent to concentration camps. Thousands more were murdered. All independent political parties were dissolved. Only the Nazis remained.  It happened that quickly. There were less than four months between Germany's last free elections, in November 1932, and the passage of the Enabling Acts in March 1933. If you want to learn more about this, read Richard Evans' *The Coming of the Third Reich.* It's widely published and easy to understand.  ***  Now that I've told you what I think, let me actually answer your question.  On the night that Hitler became Reich Chancellor, Goebbels organized a torchlight parade in Berlin with some 60,000 participants. Some observers noted in their journals that Goebbels had the marchers go in a circle, so as to pass the reviewing stand at least twice in order to create the impression of greater numbers. There were still plenty of cheers regardless.  Though the Nazis put on a show of force with the parade and other events, they were careful to stage the production as a show of support for Hindenburg, to say that the parades were a ""tribute to Hindenburg"" and that they were not truly disrupting the traditional order. There were marches in other cities as well, and occasional violent clashes with Communists. There was a shootout in Spandau, shots fired from a house in Charlottenburg at a march. Copies of the communist party newspaper were seized and burned.  Generally, however, the leftist parties and left-center parties tried to keep a low profile, fearing a government crackdown on their operations. There was local opposition, but nothing organized at a national level.  Four days after taking the Chancellorship, Hitler made moves to keep the leadership of the German Army neutral. He feared a coup, and to reduce the chance of that, he spoke to Army leaders and pledged to do many of the things they favored ─ fight the Treaty of Versailles, restore conscription, and destroy Marxism.  On Feb. 4, the cabinet issued a decree allowing the government to detain for up to three months (without trial) people who used weapons to breach the peace. It was targeted at people resisting Nazi stormtroopers.   Before Hitler became Chancellor, the Prussian police had been keeping an eye on Nazis and other paramilitaries who caused trouble. The police might not have been able to act against these armed groups because of political considerations, but they still investigated them. Hitler ordered those investigations to stop.  In the middle of February, Hitler also created an auxiliary police force made up of Nazi paramilitaries, in effect putting Nazi violence under the protection of the police.  In the beginning of February, the Nazi minister of the Interior, Wilhelm Frick, and Hermann Goring (the minister of the Interior for Prussia) began banning Social Democratic newspapers. The Social Democrats responded by suing, which had some success.  As the month went on, the Social Democrats began to join the Communists as targets of violence from Nazi paramilitaries. In response, the Social Democrats tried to stick to a legalistic defense. They did not want to respond to Nazi violence with violence of their own, an act that would encourage a heavy-handed response from the federal government.  In Wurttemberg State, the president, Eugen Bolz, declared the new government to be an enemy of freedom. Hitler responded that Bolz had no room to talk, since he hadn't protected the Nazi Party when it was persecuted in the 1920s.  ""Those who made no mention of our freedom for 14 years have no right to talk about it today. As Chancellor I need only use one law for the protection of the national state, just as they made a law for the protection of the Republic back then, and then they would realize that not everything they called freedom was worthy of the name,"" Hitler said in a speech.  While the Nazi paramilitaries were making enemies of the Social Democrats and the Communists (and to a lesser extent, the Centre Party), there were plenty of people in Germany who delighted in what he was doing. Remember, this was the Great Depression, and there were many in Germany who enjoyed his actions.  Evans quotes the diary of a woman named Louise Solmitz:  ""I’m delighted at Hitler’s lack of a programme, for a programme is either lies, weakness, or designed to catch silly birds. ─ The strongman acts from the necessity of a serious situation and can’t allow himself to be bound.""  "
"When I say the first week ""wasn't that important"" that's because it wasn't in the overall arc, compared to the Reichstag fire. The fire and decree is the crucial piece.   But there were definite actions that signaled the threat:  - Hitler dissolved the Reichstag on February 3 for elections. His main message was to urge the nation to ""end its humiliation by voting Nazi,"" and that he had a ""four year plan.""   - The government ordered the police to begin searches of the homes of Communist leaders, without obtaining a warrant.   - Twenty antifascists were killed in clashes with the Nazi para-military SA in the first week.   - A press gag law was introduced aimed at limiting criticism. Hitler justified this because he said they were failing to follow his orders to avoid threatening law and order. Several socialist and communist newspapers were outright banned.   This Spectator article from the era gives you some flavour. It is from early March, just after the Reichstag decree.    http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/3rd-march-1933/7/terror-in-germany  It references the press gag law from his first week, but even here, you can see that the real acceleration is the fire and the resulting decree. "
> The first week in power wasn't that important.   But did he do anything at all during his first couple of days as Chancellor or right after he was given autocratic powers? With all due respect, OP didn't ask for an explanation about how Hitler rose to power.
> Political opponents were sent to the concentration camps.  They already had concentration camps in 1933?! When were they created and what was their ostensible purpose early on?
Is there any evidence as to the popular appeal of communism in Germany at the time? With the soviet revolution less than 20 years beforehand presumably communism would have been thought a viable alternative system of government - certainly with the backdrop of the Great Depression and Weimar Republic seeming to highlight the failures of democratic capitalism? 
"Concentration camps were created soon after Hitler ascended to power in 1933. Himmler organized one of the first in Dachau, north of Munich, for political prisoners, i.e. communists and social democrats. (Himmler took charge of all concentration camps later.)  In 1935, Hitler claimed that as soon as the war started he would begin an ""euthanasia"" program to get rid off those ""lives that are not worth living"": psychotic delinquents, the mentally and physically challenged, and children with birth defects. The first case of euthanasia came in July of 1939 and was carried by Hitler's own private doctor, Karl Brandt.  (I include the second bit of information in this post because, like concentration camps, ""euthanasia"" is closely related to the Shoah but both were used before on other groups of people.)  Source: Anthony Beevor's ""The Second World War"""
The police primarily. The SA was more about political violence.   In fact the arrests came first on the night of the 27th and inspired the decree the next day as a way to legally justify the arrests and keep the communists in prison. The cabinet had discussed such a decree previously, but the execution was quite bold. They included a clause that allowed the central government to seize control of the state police forces.   The execution of the decree depended on the Lander (state) within Germany. Some just banned a few Communist newspapers and detained a few officials. Those were later taken over by Reich Commissars under the decree.   Prussia was already under a Nazi interior minister (Goring) and as many as 10,000 people were imprisoned by the police.   Keep in mind, Goring had been doing this during the election before the fire, but the courts kept ordering releases and restricting the ability of the police to detain. After the decree, the check of the courts was ended. 
"Happy to help. Within the Weimar Constitution was [Article 48](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008220), which states: ""If public security and order are seriously disturbed or endangered within the German Reich, the President of the Reich may take measures necessary for their restoration, intervening if need be with the assistance of the armed forces.""  That same article also allows the Reich president to ""temporarily suspend in whole or in part the fundamental rights"" including the rights I mentioned above.  Emergency articles like these are common in constitutions around the world, and they are frequently abused by authoritarian governments or governments en route to authoritarianism. Germany's inclusion of such an emergency article is understandable if you comprehend the situation in 1919, when the Weimar Constitution was enacted."
"The German Left was split between the Social Democrats, which had broad appeal, and more extreme factions. This radical-left went through a series of parties. First the Spartacus League formed soon after the end of the First World War. When one of their strike/demonstrations pulled more than half a million participants the more revolutionary among them launched an attempt to overthrow the government. The Spartacist Uprising in 1919 didn't go so well between the anti-communist paramilitary force known as the Freikorps (mostly great war veterans who'd walked off with their military equipment) and a government that was still more in charge than it seemed at the time.  Later, a Communist Party formed. But, it was torn between people who wanted violent overthrow of the government and those who wanted to democratically enact communism. There was constant infighting at the top, which led the party line to lurch unpredictably and damped the ability of the party to really recruit during the early 1920's. The most extreme left was badly undercut with Polish victory in the Polish-Soviet War, after which it was clear that military assistance from Russia wasn't coming.   But, just because the Soviets couldn't get troops to Germany didn't mean that they couldn't get money and experts there. With a bit of outside support and a definitive winner in the hierarchy of the allowed the party to be one of the largest and most influential non-Russian communist parties, often polling around 10%.  Still, the Communist Party won 13% of the vote in 1932. Added to the 18% won by the Social Democrats they outnumbered the Nazis in the Reichstag. But, the two parties never really worked out their issues to form the center of a coalition that could rule, in no small part that the Communist Party was following the line of ""Social Fascism"" which argued that the Social Democrats were secret Fascists because they didn't want to do away with the free market immediately. Though, that position was bolstered by the fact that the Social Democrats were often in power at the provincial level when the Communists launched their attempted revolutions and often were in charge of the police that suppressed revolutionary movements. There was even an attempt in Prussia (where Social Democrats were strongest) of coordination between Communists and Nazis to oust them by plebiscite, which convinced the leadership of the Social Democrats that there wasn't a lot of difference between Red and Brown."
"Concretely the KPD (German Communist Party) received 4.8 million votes (12.3 %) in the last federal election before Hitler's ascendancy.   There were a lot of limitations that meant the communists weren't able to properly cohere left-wing resistance throughout the late 20s and early 30s though. The most important of which was the comintern's policy during the ""third period"", which saw the KPD arguing that there was fundamentally no difference between the Social Democrats and the Nazis, and that Hitler's government would be just as unstable as the conservative governments that had preceded it, and that once it inevitably fell it would be the communists turn to take power.   Obviously they were wrong on all accounts, and this ultraleft sectarianism meant that they weren't able to provide any kind of effective leadership against fascism.

"There was a prominent 'yes' campaign in the 1967 referendum, run by the organisation Federal Council for the Advancement Of Aboriginals And Torres Strait Islanders, which had posters, advertisements in papers, and even advertising jingles on radio ([there are some examples of editorials and ads here](http://indigenousrights.net.au/civil_rights/the_referendum,_1957-67/campaigning_for_a_yes_vote)). In contrast, there was *no* significant 'no' campaign in the 1967 referendum - which made it unique amongst Australian referenda.   In parliament, all of the major parties supported a 'yes' vote, and so there was no published 'case' for a 'no' vote in the parliamentary record. And this was the point, in a way: the referendum to amend the references to indigenous people in the constitution was a surefire thing that the huge majority of people had agreed on by 1967 (successful referendums being necessary to change the Australian constitution). The government of the time hoped to get up another, more controversial, amendment to the constitution relating to Federal vs state powers, and were hoping that that amendment would piggyback its way to success on the more popular one.   It should be said that there's some controversy over the meaning of the constitutional amendment to omit the mentions of indigenous peoples in the constitutions; it's more complicated than 'recognising Aboriginals as Australian citizens'. Attwood and Markus in 1998 argued that its implications for the legal rights and status of indigenous peoples in Australia were slight, as in most states Aborigines had already had the rights of citizens, such as the right to vote (apart from, sort of, in Western Australia and Queensland). Attwood and Markus argue that the change was largely symbolic for this reason. Elsewhere, Taffe in 2007 argued that the real change that resulted from the constitutional amendment was that Aboriginal affairs was no longer a state but rather a Federal responsibility. Where, previously, Federal governments had argued that indigenous people were the responsibility of the states, they no longer had this particular excuse; as a result, for example, the Whitlam government set up a department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1972.   There are a few reasons why the 'yes' vote was popular, especially amongst the majority of the Australian population that lived in cities. By 1967, the advent of television in the 1950s had opened many eyes to how difficult conditions were for indigenous peoples. Additionally, the Australian public was aware of international opprobrium about the Apartheid of South Africa, and did not want to become an international pariah, and the referendum seemed a clear way to demonstrate that. And in the 1960s there was a new-found prominence for indigenous rights activists, such as organisations like FCAATSI. And as the change was in many ways symbolic, there were few real grounds for opposition to it, as nobody particularly felt they would lose out (which perhaps might have been different if the consitutional amendments clearly implied the land rights which came about after the Mabo decision in the 1990s, for example).  In general, advocacy for the 'no' vote was largely seen in public in letters to the editor, and was often quite racist; one letter to the editor of the *Adelaide Advertiser* claimed the vote would propel indigenous people ""into the turmoil of a civilization they probably do not understand and do not want"". More genteel arguments against the amendment revolved around arguments for states' rights, which would be undermined by the change to the constitution. However, even this was quite muted; the Premier of Queensland, Frank Nicklin, appears to have had assurances by Harold Holt that they would continue working with the states on Aboriginal Affairs. There's also some suggestion that state Premiers were happy to handball responsibility for a difficult portfolio - that they probably did not understand and did not want - to the Federal government.  The highest 'no' vote was in Western Australia, where there was a 20% no vote. Western Australia of course had a successful referendum to secede from Australia in 1933 (which was ignored by the Federal parliament), which is emblematic of Western Australians having less trust in the distant, Eastern-based Federal Government than the rest of Australia. There were also higher 'no' votes in country areas - the highest being in Kalgoorlie in country Western Australia, which almost hit 30% (and which still has some significant and highly publicised tensions between the indigenous and white parts of its community).

This response is absolutely unacceptable. We have a [zero-tolerance policy for racism or bigotry of any kind](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_civility) on /r/AskHistorians. You have been banned.
What did they do? I can't see anything other than a surface meaning there...
There's a quite detailed paper by Thomas Musgrave in the *Macquarie Law Journal* from 2003 which goes into some detail on this ([and which is freely available on the web](https://www.mq.edu.au/public/download/?id=16258)).   To pretty briefly summarise that paper, Western Australia's presence in the Australian federation is to some extent an accident of history. If there hadn't been a gold rush in the 1890s which brought in a large amount of people from the other colonies (who ended up voting in the 1900 referendum on whether to join), Western Australia would likely not have joined the federation. Previous to the gold rush, Western Australia had done well out of exports to the other colonies (for which the state charged tariffs), and those tariffs were phased out under federation. Further, federal tariffs on agricultural products, once Western Australia had signed up, harmed the predominantly agrarian Western Australian economy in comparison to the more industrialised East.   The perception that Western Australia getting a bum rap from the Federal government - [echoes of which are still around today](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/sep/05/waxit-beware-independence-western-australia-a-la-brexit-makes-no-sense) - culminated in a referendum of Western Australian voters in 1933, in which around two-thirds of the Western Australian public voted for secession. This was put to the British parliament, who said it could only lawfully happen with a referendum of all the other states on the matter - which never happened.
They quoted the racist letter to the editor, which claimed indigenous people didn't understand or want Western-style government, to refer to states, making the point that those governments struggled to understand or interact with indigeonous culture.
Hey! You look amazing and bad ass!! Life can be complete and utter ass sometimes but we stay for the small things. The silver linings of life, whether that is just seeing a sunset one more time, or eating a really really good dessert, idk whatever makes the overall meh feeling of existence just moldy more bearable. I do hope that you find some solver linings and maybe life lets up on you a bit! Best of luck!
"I saw your picture and planned on responding later, but the thought of it is distracting me from work. You are simply stunning, my dear, and I love your whole aesthetic. As to the college applications, let me say how much I loathe elitists and their self-serving ""acceptance policies."" I finished my degree 5 years ago give or take and it's benefited me sweet f-all. Don't stop trying to advance, but find your beauty and strength in what YOU find important and screw all the rest. You are beautiful and awesome."
Don't feel bad for posting here, we're all pleased as Punch you're still with us! Big hug, dm me anytime you need a friend.
Absolutely don't feel bad for posting this, you deserve to have your heart and soul tended to like anyone else.  Let's begin with this  *LOUD APPLAUSE*  Two years!! That's two years of being brave enough to stay alive a little longer, that is inner strength,courage and sheer determination to fight your demons and that is some serious warrior might right there.  As for College I know its heart wrenching and a feeling of failure....I say it's just a bunch of colleges not worth going to because they couldn't see your potential and that's their loss.  Friends will come in time but now is your time to grow, time to heal, time to master yourself.  I wish for your mental health I could say one day will be cured but I have it too and that would be a lie BUT... we can learn to fight it, master it and stop it from making us bow to it, instead in time we might make Mental issues our bitch, who knows but you are a fighter two years says so.  Keep fighting, keep battling because you survived and that is because you deserve to be here, you are stronger and better than what you think.  Stay strong, keep battling because you are an inspiration to others who feel like quitting.  You will win in the end.
Thank you so much for the reply! I‘m desperately trying to hold on to the little things at the moment. It keeps me going :)
Thank you for your kind words. I did tear up a bit when reading your comment, to be honest. I always thought that I could not succeed in life without a college education, and seeing old high school friends finding their dream university and getting accepted immediately, while failing at everything myself, just hurts. I guess I have to set my priorities right. I‘ve seen people succeed without a degree, but for some reason, I need some form of evidence that I‘m not in fact useless.
This is very sweet of you, thank you so much!
Oh stop it you‘re going to make me cry!! I‘m actually going to print this comment out and hang it above my bed or something. This made me feel so good about staying in this world. I never really thought about it, but I wouldn’t have seen so many beautiful things happen if I had left. Thank you for taking the time to write this, it means a lot. And you‘re right, we have to keep fighting these illnesses!
No way u are 49. You look a lot younger.
first of all Happy Birthday dude, great to see people helping out there parents and don't worry it's never to late to have a partner in your life
Much respect not many people would take care of their parents when they need it most keep going man you are the man
"/u/xologo you look great for 49!   I know it's hard having to care for someone, it's the hardest thing we do. Helping our loved ones run out the clock on life. And it's usually thankless work. So I want to say ""Thank you!"" For putting some good in this world. Goodness doesn't naturally exist, it's not a natural resource you can find just anywhere. We have to put it out, and sometimes we don't want to, sometimes we want to throw the world the bird and just close our eyes.  Thank you for putting good into the world my guy.  You need to look at yourself in the mirror and speak some truths to the person you're looking at.  We spend most of our lives looking at others, and often our phones, computers, or televisions get a good amount of attention too.  Walk into your bathroom, look into the mirror and say something nice to yourself. The trick here is you don't actually have to mean it!!! Your brain has a bunch of nifty little tricks up it's sleeve to appreciate you saying that to a reflection of yourself, even if you don't believe what you're saying.  We all need to love ourselves a little more, and you need to as well.  All things being equal, if you're a regular guy. Then you're worthy of love, you're worthy of friendship, you're worthy of good things. And while life might feel like it's taking the most epic, burrito fueled shit on you from time to time. I promise you, life has the capacity to get better. No matter how dark and shrouded your life may feel. There will be a break, things will change. And the change may hurt, but it will get better, the pain will subside.  You're never alone man... ever.  I want to frame this next moment for you properly. I'm a straight white guy, married, and living the life I can.  But if I could, buddy. I'd give you a hug, and tell you it's alright. We're always so rushed into things that we forget it's okay to stop, think, breath, and even cry. You look like you a need a judgement free hug.  No judgment here man. Not one ounce of it. Just a hug.  I don't know if you drink, get high, or use any intoxicant at all, but when I open my first beer this weekend to celebrate my birthday I'll cheer to you, and I'll drink to you.  You're never forgotten, and you're never alone."
Happy birthday, you don't look your age! Sorry to hear you're feeling lonely, I hope that changes. This is a great place to get talking to some new people. Good luck, enjoy your day! X
Happy birthday, friend! I hope you soon find yourself surrounded by loving people. You look like a kind man and you deserve to have wonderful people in your life, such as yourself! Don’t fret, its never too late to find people to be around. You’ll be ok!😀
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! It is extremely hard to be  caregiver & I just want to say I recognize the work you’re doing to care for her.  Life sucks so much sometimes and I am SO sorry that you’re dealing with mental illness... it’s such a bitch.  I am sending you so much love! And you look great in this picture!!
Typo: 39th birthday
Is this a dream? I can't believe people wrote such beautiful comments. Nothing like this has happened to me before, what with such kind words and accolades that made me feel super special. I don't even know anyone who commented or voted up, but I feel more loved than I have in years.   I love my mom so much, and we miss my dad immensely.   I feel better than I did 12 hours ago. Sure, it might partly be because of me being bipolar 1.  But I know it's primarily because of the kindness of everyone here. Thank you all. It means a lot. I can't emphasize this enough. Am I dreaming?  Edit : thank you for the gold. I'm humbled by your kindness.
And with that hair at 49? Dude is lucky
Agreed! My dad found the love of his life at 67 and has never been happier 💜
Grateful for your kind words. Thank you.
Right?! I'm his age and what's left of mine is gray.
Man do not let your past define your future. I know your family hurt you and your girlfriend's death must have been really tough, but think about the amazing things life can still offer you. You are so young and handsome and still have so much life out there for you. Don't give up!
Yesterday I saw my friends dad give him a hug and he genuinely said “I love you buddy” this really shocked me, just the idea that people act that way and it seems kinda silly looking back that it was a surprise but I think it can really make a difference to the world.   You could be just like that person, you can break the chain and make the world a genuinely better place just by sticking around when times seem tough. (Sorry if I went on a bit of a tangent)  I also think that you mean a whole lot more to people than you think. At times when I’m feeling really down I often think that everyone hates me but there are moments when I can tell that someone is happy that I’m there or that I’ve made their day slightly better just for a moment.   I don’t really know where I went with this but it’s really important that you try your very hardest to push through the moments when everything seems pointless because it can only go up from there. Also remember that you are worth more than you think, even if you struggle to genuinely believe this just try to remember it because it’s true.  I hope you do well in the future and if things seem really tough and you don’t think you can talk to anyone about it my inbox is always open to you!
My condolences for your loss. I’m proud of you for getting checked out at the mental health hospitals. It’s not easing coping with a loss and it’s ok to seek help from others. It took courage to go get checked out by providers and I am so proud of you. You have a inner strength in you that has kept you here on earth. Please keep that fire within you burning. You are needed here on earth. You are wanted. I care for you. I love you bro.  Your mothers passing was not in your control and your family clearly have an altered perception of the situation. Your are a precious gift left by your mother. She is apart of you. She left earth and wanted you to stay as a gift to the family and the world. Don’t take away your mothers gift by leaving earth.  You are precious. You are unique. You are an original. You are strong. You are worth everything in the whole world. You are priceless. You are courageous. You are strong. You are special. You are you.   Please don’t leave. Keep that fire burning in your belly that has kept you here. You are wanted, needed, and cared for. I care for you. I love you bro.  Please hang on. Please stay. Please feel free to message me anytime!
THAT'S AN AMAZING SWEATER. don't let your asshole family get to you. You're better than them.
Thanks mate, i proberly sadly have let it define me far too long but i go to two psycatrist a week trying to become better.
Thanks for real you made me tear up, i fucking need you to say this. Thanks alot i am truly greatfull for you and your words. Im gonna come back and read this whenever im feeling down ❤
Thanks lol this sweater is the first thing i bought for myself in months.
Getting help is already such a huge step forward man, that just shows how brave you really are :) also even though I'm not a professional, feel free to drop me a private message if you feel the need to talk to someone. Let's take you out from that hole of bad feelings, shall we? :)
Younger i can believe, but prettier seems hardly possible. What i’m about to say might sound a bit offensive, but in a year you’ll see the truth of it. 1/ him leaving you was his choice, and not your fault  2/ be glad he left you now, instead of dragging it out for a few years, leaving you worse off and probably scarred for life  3/ it’s a tough time now. But you need to realise it’s temporarily. Focus on yourself, do yourself. Look for the small things in life to lift you up, and they will make you happy again  4/ you’re a gorgeous woman. Once you’re back on your feet, you’ll find someone better.
Prettier than you? How? You're gorgeous! And you deserve better. 💜
Quite stunning how shallow society continues to be. Comment after comment jumping on the “younger prettier” thing you said, defending your looks vigilantly without any knowledge of what the other girl looks like.  Maybe she is prettier (which is subjective). Who cares. That’s one of thousands of characteristics and not the most important one by a long shot. She cheated with a married man.  Her character and her morals do not seem to be your match.  Looks always fade. Bodies always age.  Most people are piling on about your beauty, which sure is a nice asset right now, but when it does fade, you’ll know you lived honorably and with integrity unlike your ex and his fling, and those are the qualities that will lead to long term happiness anyway.
You're young, you're gorgeous. You have a goddamn pupper! Not having you and this pup is definitely your husband's loss. Chin up, this is probably good riddance. You've been saved from a lifetime of feeling insecure, possible infidelity, and gaslighting. Also, your eye makeup is bomb.
Less than one year? Bullet dodged even if you think like that.
Is the affair partner 17? You look quite young and pretty. Divorce is tough but just remember it's not the end of your old life, it's the beginning of your new life. Any future partner of yours is going to thank their lucky stars your husband cheated.
I don't want this to come across as flippant as I can't imagine the distress that moron has caused you, but my honest instant reaction to reading your post was - is this dude fucking blind??????
Came here to say this. You have plenty of time to heal and still have meaningful relationships, if that's what you choose to do. And if you enjoy schadenfreude, you can bet that she won't last very long either.
This comment.  You are stunning.  Also, how has no one pointed out the fact that she appears to be already moving on with that lovely mate in photo #2!!  You got this sweetheart.  grow from this experience and realize your true worth! =)
Thank you for this, truly.
I hope I look this good when I’m 33
Just because you love it doesn't mean it can't be practical. Making ceramics provides something useful to people, and you can make a business of it. Plus, it seems like you have a real talent for it.
That's one beautiful mug! And the coffee cup looks nice, too.
a.) That mug is pretty and I want it.  b.) I did a degree in something practical (politics). I went and worked a job in it, and was in a position to start a career in it, and I....saw what I was looking down the barrel of and noped the fuck out and went back to school for what I love (history), and am working on a doctorate. You're making the right choice. When you love something, you fight for it.
I hope you find all the success you want in ceramics! I know this is a Toast Me, but as a holder of a BFA in Ceramics who is now a successful oncology nurse, I just want you to know that there are nearly zero jobs in ceramics. Unless you are incredibly driven and resourceful, it will be very very difficult to make money, much less enough to have things like health insurance, a nice house, financial security, etc. I know 7 ppl from my ceramics class who are still trying to make it work after 8 years and none of them contribute a significant amount to their household income. The ones that are single are either scraping by with odd jobs or rely on their parents.  My wife and I met in art school (she did graphic design) and after graduation, I had no plan nor any means to make ceramics/money. I wound up bartending and seeing my mom go through breast cancer before deciding I needed to do something to provide for myself and my family. Now Im a registered nurse with an amazing career caring for other ppl, have exceptional health benefits that are essentially free and live a very comfortable happy life. My hope is to keep ceramics in my back pocket until later in life when it is practical.  I am proud of you for pursuing your dreams, but I encourage you to at least take courses in marketing and/or business to help increase your chances of success as an artist. The reality is that we all need money, but that doesn’t mean that we have to sacrifice our dreams. There is a middle ground and they likely won’t teach you that in art school. I remember when they told us that 80something % of art students end up not doing art after graduation, I scoffed. I was elected leader for our thesis class (The Merry Mullberries, I might add), “I’m pursuing my dreams!!”, I yelled at them in my head. But reality hit after graduation and I had to make something happen. Don’t get blindsided by having nothing to do after graduation.  I hope you find your success and I’m proud of you for pursuing your dreams! If you want to talk about it, PM me. As someone who has been exactly where you are now, I know the conflicted feelings you’re having and can totally relate. Have a great weekend!  Edit: Also that mug aint half bad. You have a good handle and the minor lip is nice. What level ceramics class are you in now?
Stupid sexy Flanders.
I would like to apologise on behalf of the only two replies you received being very nasty.   In case you haven't checked back, your comment was very well-received because it was very cute, and the two douchey comments were heavily downvoted. Ya did good 👍
You called?
Life may be a bitch, but you’re a badder one!   Your lashes are amazing! You’re gorgeous! You’re gonna keep kicking life’s ass!
No worries about the username.  I have a feeling it isn't your main account so we won't hold it against you!  :P   Also, great work staying positive, others will look to you for inspiration.  Gorgeous eyes too, they tell a story of staying strong through mire!
Mom had a miscarriage. Her sister-in-law too.  Aaaaand here I am, 21 years later, studying at the university, and with two awesome cousins.   Don't give up gurl, good things are worth waiting for! :)
May your mascara stay intact for the whole day with this new peace that you’ve hopefully found ❤️
I’m very proud you let your emotion be expressed and even though it was rough, I’m sure, you let yourself feel, and cry and heal! I’m really happy for you!  Why did you wanted to end your life if you weren’t pregnant by a certain age? I’m sorry if I’m not allowed to ask this type of questions in this sub, I don’t really know. I’m just really curious.
Thank you so much. You m gonna hold on to that bad bitch energy!
I love how ironic your username is, considering you are a moderator of the LEAST offensive subreddit
I just feel like I’ve failed or like I’m broken. I know it is considered a mature pregnancy after thirty and your chances become lesser. Also I was raised that becoming a mother is my only job and anything else is a sin. I was discouraged from going to school (I did it anyway, but it was made clear that is was ‘selfishness against god’) I was discouraged from having a career... sometimes it feels like I was raised my whole life for something I can’t even do. I know with counseling that my logic is flawed, but it still hit pretty close to home as I type it out.
The trolls who comment mean-spirited things here would agree my username checks out when I'm dealing with them.
Oh my gosh this just touched my heart! I dont know you but i’m proud of you! This is some REAL strength and courage right there!
Way to fuckin go my man ! Now time for a lap around the pool with those middle fingers held high.   Yes I know that will make it harder to swim but you’re a pro you got this.
Courage isn't the absence of fear.  It's being scared shitless and doing it anyway.  Well done!  And your handwriting makes by brain really, really happy.
Seriously. He almost died but he was able to overcome the very thing that nearly killed him. It’s like that hang glider guy that didn’t get strapped in and hung for his life but now wants to go again.
Genuinely looks more like 25
Excellent genes, girl! You’re older than my mom, but you look like you’re my age, damn! (And if you’re looking for love, here’s hoping it comes to you in every way that you deserve♥️ )
Happy birthday! 42 my ass!
You are crazy hot for 42, don’t look it at all
22 yr old male here and I would marry you in a heartbeat
Well, a lot of people already said it, but you look so young! It's incredible! If I'd meet you, I would think that you're maybe not even 30, to be honest!
The more half asleep I am, the younger I look. Up to a point. Then I just look like a sack of dirty socks.
Not even kidding i was questioning the age way too much
I'm not rushing love. But it would be nice to have someone other than my cat to cuddle.
No kids, no smoking. Lots of naps, chocolate, and cartoons.
Thank you. I can pass for 28, so that's something.
I hog the bed. Fair warning.
r/shittysuperpowers
Me pick me, pick me. Right here, pick me
No kids by choice or because 8 years single?  Naps chocolate and cartoons :) can’t go wrong with that!  And well done on not smoking! Non smoker lungs is enjoyable lol
It’s 10am on a Sunday and I’m crying laughing.
Forget about it. Pick the cat
None by choice. I love my naps too much. And my free time.
Legal age in Australia is 18. Let's play in slightly harder mode.
You go dude! Be an inspiration!
What a legend! I’m sorry about your trauma but you’ve come out of it like a beast. Keep at it man!
Wow you should be a motivational speaker or wrote a book or something that’s an amazing story 🙌🏼
Thank you for sharing hope!
Thanks!
Thank you!  I will *never* give up!
"Here's the story from Wikipedia. [The Riyadh Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_compound_bombings).  I've written a story of my account to post on another sub-reddit, but it always seems like a ""pity-party"" or a ""woe is me"" story.  I've rewritten it over a dozen times, but still not satisfied with it.  When I get a version I like, will post it on Reddit and see where it goes.  My story (so far) is about twelve thousand words..."
Oh my god, are you kidding me? GIANT toast to you, girl! I applaud you immensely for going clean, that a whole other level of strength and will power! I believe in you and there are so many people rooting for you, I really hope you can go & stay clean! You deserve it, I can tell you’re strong enough to!
"Mate, 36 days is 36 days. That's 3110400 seconds, 51840 minutes, 864 hours. That's no small feat. I can't commit to anything for 36 days.  Be proud of yourself and celebrate every day you take another step forward. If you happen to find yourself taking a step backwards, that's okay. You haven't failed, It's just a stumble. Pick yourself up and keep moving on.  Celebrate every second, minute, hour and day. Every moment that passes you move further and further away from what was keeping you down. Try not to focus on a goal months down the road, aim for 37 days. Then 38. You'll breeze past 39, and then 40+.  Every day is a big ""Fuck you"" to that addiction trying to keep you down."
\_clinks glass and then raises it\_  Hello everyone! We're here today to celebrate /u/wallflower-power and her 36 days of sobriety. While I do not have the details I am sure that they have been difficult and arduous. She has held strong for 36 days, which is to be commended! I mean not even the Spartans at Thermopylae held out for this long and they too fought an enemy against all odds.  You are a warrior, /u/wallflower-power, who has lasted 36 Days. It is clear you have much strength. Here is too thousands more days of conquering your enemies!   Cheers and congratulations!  \_clinks glass with closest toaster\_
Keep going and don’t let yourself fall back in that whole. Before you know it, 36 days will turn into 66 days, and then 100, 200, 300, and you’ll keep going. I believe in you.
 Joutney of  thousand days begins with  a single step. You are  36 steps into it. Steady on, you will get there. We all hve our struggles my wife and I are celebrating our 50th nniversary this month. Getting here took a lot, for both of us. We are rooting for you.
Firstly Happy Birthday lass.  Living with your parents isn't the worst thing, I was 28 when I finally moved out and that was 11 years ago now and looking back I don't regret it. I had no direction and no plan back then.  I think some of us in this world need to feel a little lost, because that's when we truly find ourselves.  Sometimes it's easier to just imagine where you want to be in 10 years time and start simply like that.  You can alter the details as you go along.or sometimes the universe might it for you.  As for dating when I was 25 I thought I would end up a lonely old man, here I am 39, married with two children and twins on the way. Again I really think that when you find that right person you will know but for now date, live your life doing whatever makes you smile.  Your future is coming and I think its going to bright and full of love and adventure just don't forget to enjoy the now because you deserve to be happy.
Your hair is BEAUTIFUL and I hope you have a great birthday!!! I believe in you, you can get through this rough patch and achieve anything you put your mind to :)
You know what you are doing with your life. Right now, you are living with your parents, searching for the next step. What a lucky person to have that luxury! Notice the wonderful things around you. Your path will reveal itself. Just live!   Oh, and travel. Travel a lot.   And dating sucks until it doesn’t.
This!!!! I'm only 25 and love with my parents still. Spend time with them and enjoy life. Love comes to us when we dont expect it!!! Stay positive and you will find it!!! Also, you have amazing hair!!
That's amazing news!!! You're doing so well :) I also love your nose piercing and tattoos, they look dope as fuck
That’s two big achievements right there! You must also be very talented with that sign!  Btw your hair looks effortlessly pretty :)
Dang girl! You are on a path of self love and self care! With all you said, it sounds like you're doing some incredible things in your life and if no one has said it already, I am very proud of you. Keep it up, school will be great!
thank you very much disturbed oranges <3
I hope you have some wonderful moments in your time left.
I took a look at your profile. You make some amazing cakes.
Dear sweet girl,  I’m sorry that you and your husband are going through this and all it entails. I hope the pain is not too bad, that you are surrounded by people you love and who love you, that you find ways to laugh more than you cry, that you get to eat all the foods you love, watch your favorite movies on repeat, and enjoy peace during these days. Sending you both warm vibes from Cali. 💜
Stay strong. Stay brave. Do whatever makes you happy. This time is all about you.
I truly hope that when you transcend from this plane on to the next it is with easy and without pain. That all of atoms, particles, very fiber of your being that somehow animates the clay golem we call the human body, reach out into the ether and far realms of the universe and just become love. Best of wishes my friend.
I know that this must be hard. Actually, I can't know how hard it is, but I hope you and your husband are happy.
Your cakes look incredible, and I love your hair color.  *Hug
You weren't lying, those are some beautiful fuckin cakes
y’all sparked my interest. i must say that the debby cake in my hand looks like crap after seeing hers. they’re awesome!
This is gonna sound like a roast but I mean it in a good way. You look like a cool hipster Santa claus. That's awesome.
Your face looks so so kind. Definitely someone I would feel at ease around. Your eyes and beard are actually out of this world and your rings look SO COOL! I hope you're being kind to yourself, both mentally and physically.   People who seem like they have it together are almost always hiding insecurities and pain and trauma under their facade. Please don't feel like you're alone in your pain. We are all here. 💚
Thank you everyone so much. I’m doing my best to be safe to myself and things like this are helping me greatly, I’m seeking all the help I can. You all are so fantastic thank you all so much. 💙
No that’s one of the most creative things I’ve ever heard thank you!😭
Not as sweet or as heartfelt as the rest of these comments but  Your eyebrows are on point and I'm jealous.
You could rock the bald look after recovery if you get attached to the look. 😀  Rooting for you!
Bless your heart. You are beautiful and strong & I’m so happy you are beating this awful disease. Keep fighting beautiful. ❤️
You have managed to keep at least 1 plant alive which is more than I can do! Cheers to you!
This actually made me laugh! I've always had the thickest brows and they've suffered quite a bit, seems like I shouldn't be so worries after all.   Thank you
You have a really cute smile! Happy birthday, keep smiling
Happy Birthday!!!  Wow been a while since I was 15 ....24 years ago infact 🤣  Seriously though enjoy your birthday, fill it with fun joy and smiles.
Happy birthday stranger! Have a wonderful birthday and keep that nice smile up haha :)
Thank you so much for your message! Have a great day :)
I am 100% here for this news! Congrats!!! Summer has passed and Autumn has greeted you, so embrace the new season and colors and keep that strength up because not only do you deserve it, but you are absolutely incredible for coming this far! Be proud of what you have accomplished, no matter what happens!
Some people have climbed everest, some people have have sailed the world, most of us try to overcome everyday struggles. We'll done and understand if you fall again just pick yourself up again and fight.  Don't judge anyone until you've swam in the waters they drowned in
WOW! That's amazing news, my friend!! YOU ARE AMAZING! And I'm extremely SUPER proud of you!! You're strong and resilient and awesome!! Keep going, okay? You're worth it. And you got this!! I'm rooting for you!!! 💯
I’m so proud of you! This is a huge accomplishment!
Who the F would stand you up?? They stupid!!
So sad to hear that as you look like a great girl to know, well done for not letting it get to you and good luck on finding someone who treats you wonderfully!
It's your date's loss, not yours!  You're very attractive, and your hair is amazing!
For real she a babe
Right?!? Girl is model  gorgeous!!!  Your face is slightly unusual but still classically beautiful.  You have such nice cheek bones and jaw line and gorgeous eyes.  What a dumb asssssss
Congrats 🎈🎉🎊 Keep on keeping on.
Hi, congrats on the milestone! You definitely look like you could be an up-and-coming actor haha. Take care of yourself! You will go on to do great things :)
And tomorrow will be 6 months and 1 day, you’ve got this!
That is one of my favorite hairstyles. It’s simple, sophisticated and timeless.   Your skin is flawless.   I’m sorry that you are getting bullied. It DOES get better after high school.
There’s nothing wrong with how you look and I’m sorry that’s happening. It sounds like you’re definitely better off without these people in your life. Nobody needs those kind of “friends”.
The haircut looks nice, your nose is fine, your lips are beautiful and I'm prepared to imagine that your eyes are even more amazing. Never be ashamed of who you are.
I absolutely love your haircut! It looks super cool and stylish. I just cut mine short too and I absolutely love it. It’s not a Karen haircut either your classmates are just dumb idiots.
fuck dem haters bro
That haircut is one of the most classic, elegant styles out there. It was stylish 100 years ago and will be stylish 100 years from now because it’s simple, flattering, and chic. Your ex-friends suck, and high school can certainly suck as well. You, however, are a beautiful young woman and life will get better!! There is nothing piglike about your nose AT ALL and I would commit felonies to have flawless skin and lips like yours. Chin up, sweetie. Do something nice for yourself today, and if you haven’t sought help for feeling sad and depressed yet, please reach out. You deserve that support and it can really make a difference. PM me if you need help with that.
I can confirm  All of these
"Awe... Thank you so much! I actually hate my own skin ^^"""
Can also confirm. Love that length and style and wish I had skin like that!
Yeah, the ringleader was such a dick towards me for some reason and pretty much made everyone else in the group a huuuge asshole. I'm ignoring them at this point!
Thank you <333!
Agreed... jealous b’s.
Your skin is a gorgeous tone and flawless. I'm very jealous of your complexion. Your hair looks amazing too.
Glad to hear things are going better for you, man. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, though. It’s great that you can take care of things yourself but everyone can benefit from some assistance sometimes and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. Love the beard and the shirt, by the way. All the best!
It wasn’t a pride issue because I have no problem asking for help, it’s just that I’m fresh out of college and on my own.  If I had reached out to my parents or a friend, I could’ve definitely gotten help from them, but I really wanted to prove myself and know that I could’ve done it if I have to again for some reason, especially if I have a chance to go full time freelance.  And thank you!  Beard still has some growth to do as the mustache hasn’t fully come in, and I got to see them in VA and it was one of the best concerts I’ve gotten to go to!
Happy 24th birthday. You are never alone while you got reddit.   I often went through birthdays alone, to me it's just another day, probably because i don't have anyone celebrate with. 😅
Happy birthday you extremely beautiful human being
Happy Birthday! I dont have any friends really either. I cant stand the small talk crap. You will find a friend when its the right one. ☺️  Btw you are very pretty
Happy Birthday fellow Reddit friend! I totally can relate! 🎁🎈🍰🎂🍿 P.S. you look like Emma Watson, so pretty I’m jelly lol
24 can be a really lonely year! Don’t forget about us, though-Reddit friends are real friends!! Happy birthday, I hope something you did today brought you some joy. I’m sending you a big hug from Texas!
Right?!  Is this a clothing or perfume ad?  She’s obviously a model.
You shouldn’t feel pretty. You should feel beautiful. Cos you are. You’re also stylish and fun and I am so proud of you! You got this
I'm proud of you. It's incredibly hard to overcome things like that (speaking from experience) and you've managed to get healthier in spite of it. It's a big accomplishment, and it shows how hard you have worked to come so far. You're an inspiration buddy.
Hey OP,be proud of what you're doing ! So amazing trying to get your life in order ! No rush, do it slowly,but surely, build the bases, solid, unbreakable.  I hope you are surrounded by love and support, otherwise we are here.  One day youll be able to look at yourself with love and kindness cause that's what you deserve !  Wish you the best.
First off, congratulations on ONE HUNDRED (!!!) and FIVE pounds! What an absolutely incredible accomplishment. Losing weight is not easy & you deserve to feel so deeply proud. I cannot articulate how greatly sorry and heartbroken I am to hear about your rape and your consequent mental struggles, not to mention your cruel roommates. I hope your living situation has since improved. I hope you are able to aspire to a place where you never let yourself be degraded or abused again. You are worth so much more than that. And I hope you are able to find a good therapist, who is able to help you find healing and peace. What happened to you will never be justified or fair, but I truly hope you will find a way to become whole again. Sending you courage, strength, and love xx
"Slight typo in first line.  Remove the word ""both"".  Sorry."
You’re good bro
Damn... Where's the Hunk Alert flair? Needless to say that I am mega jealous. Of your turnaround. Of your tenacity. Of your resolve. Of your success.  You are a role model for many of us. Keep at it, pal.
"I've been there, mate! I was 5'9"", 87 pounds, with a heart that was on the verge of giving up completely! I'm 9 years clean this month and I can tell you that even the darkest day now is dramatically better than where I was. So, so proud of you, internet stranger, and I hope you keep on rising above! Congrats, u/Philly_Cheese1!"
Did we all just get reverse toasted?
Thank you so much!! We are all role models on here! ❤️

“We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.” - Stephen Hawking  Rest In Peace to a man who in 1962 was only expected to live two more years. Thank you for giving me someone to look up to as a lost child and sharing your genius with the world.  
A sad day for scientists and science enthusiasts around the world. He was instrumental in inspiring so many with a love for science. Even as someone in a totally unrelated field, Hawking was one of the people that made me excited about science as a kid. I'm sure I'm not the only one. Rest in peace.
"""The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge."" RIP."
Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.  It matters that you don't just give up.
Woah. One of those deaths you always saw coming but still shocks you.
i guess he did outlive his life expectancy by 60 years 
Very sad. Let's celebrate his life though, he had a good run for someone in his condition.
An absolutely monumental mind. The world mourns his loss. 
pour one out for the OG wheelin and dealin, rubber pealin, physicist on the A-List. His body may be dismissed but his knowledge will persist
Legend. So sad to see him go
No other scientist is even half as popular as he was. No scientist has reached that level of popularity in pop culture since Carl Sagan and Albert Einstein. However, it is a miracle he was able to live this long with his disease and the fact that he embraced it and found a way to live with it is inspiring. The world is a better place because of him and that can't be said of many people.
Dust to dust. Ashes to ashes. His contributions will be remembered in the annals of History and the foundations of our Science.  Sic itur ad astra. 
Sad news for everyone, not just the science community. He leaves a lasting legacy behind him, both in terms of his scientific contributions but also his perseverance in the face of a debilitating disease. He was truly an inspiration.
Wow. Did this come out of nowhere? 
He died on Pi day. I find this comfortably poetic. 
It's a shame but, I think he lived a very fulfilling life. He got an illness that usually kills most people in an incredibly short time, and then he lived out to a pretty healthy and average lifespan. All while being one of the most famous scientists of all-time, a person that was an inspiration and got so many others interested in science.  I have nothing but respect for him, I don't think history will ever forget this man.
I cant remember the last time I was this devastated.
He was the person who got me interested is science. So sad to hear this news.
In 50 years he'll be seen in a similar way as we see Einstein today. What a legendary figurehead for science.
Damn. I guess I forgot he was a person who could die. I mean he's been in my life since Dexter's Lab.  It's so weird to thin about how I've never even come close to meeting this man but his life and death still have such an impact on mine.
Smartest man of his time.
This saddens me deeply. You were an inspiration for all, Stephen, and the memory of you will last forever alongside other brilliant minds that have gone before you.  I hope your body and your soul finally get the rest you deserve.
"[You Want a Physicist to Speak at Your Funeral](https://imgur.com/gallery/cC8sAOw), and I really hope there are a lot at his service/wake/whatever event occurs for him. I don't usually get bent out of shape about ""celebrity"" passings, but this one... this is a doozy."
Man, what a sad day for science
At least he saw a fair amount of the culmination of his work, he worked on black hole theory for a long time with their existence and properties. Only a few months ago did we receive images for the first time of an event horizon of a black hole. He got to see what he believed in his whole life  Edit: typo haha
RIP. Huge loss. 
Holy shit, at a emergency hospital for my cat, browsing waiting to here back from nurse. Jesus I can’t even process this.
“I wouldn’t compare it to sex, but it lasts longer,” - Stephen Hawking on the eureka moment of scientific discovery.
I wasn't ready for him to go. I can't believe it. The world still needs him to keep us moving forward. 
He accomplished so much with the time he had, I hope he passed with few regrets- he certainly should be proud of the generations of people he inspired and his contributions to the scientific community 
What a fantastic man.  We’re going to miss him.
It’s not often that scientists are known around the world like a movie star, but he’s a guy who deserved it. What a fantastic individual. Even took time out of his busy life to do a AMA on r/Science. What an inspirational person. Even though he might pass on, the people he inspired will live for a thousand years. 
How did he live so long after? I know a guy with ALS that was in top condition. He’s 6 years in. They don’t expect him to see Christmas. This is better than normal. How did Hawking live so much longer?
Watching him do what he did despite the obstacles he faced definitely inspired me to continue along my scientific career 
I'm actually not distraught about this.  In an odd way, the universe is giving an homage to the man who probably understood it most, by allowing him to exist, then cease to exist.  He wasn't, then he was, now he isn't.  I first read A Brief History of Time in the 7th or 8th grade, and understood about half of it (the *easy* half).  Read it again as a senior in high school and understood about 75% of it.  I'm now 31, and read it again earlier this year, and now realize that I never even understood 10% of it.  If I'm being honest, I'm just now beginning to hear even the lightest of whispers of what he tried to teach to us, what he understood.  **I'm just happy that we were privileged to live during a time where we learned and grew our understanding of the world *alongside* Dr. Hawking. He wasn't some figure from a history book, he was a fellow living, breathing human being.**  Thank you and godspeed, Dr. Hawking.
You've got the top comment on a thread that will be seen by millions  of people in the next 24 hours.  Would you consider editing your comment with a link to a worthy ALS charity for people to donate to in honor of Hawking?  The ASLA is a good one: http://www.alsa.org/donate/  Edit: it's now in the main post. Good on the mods!
Couldn't agree more. In a time when maintaining the public's trust in science is becoming more and more difficult, what we really need are more people like Hawking.
Hawking was as close to a superhero as we get in the real world. Unfortunately he was also as far away from a superhero as he was close.
I don’t even begin to understand the tip of the iceberg of his knowledge, but I recognize the priceless aspect of his knowledge, along with the fact that he is one of the last truly famous physicists of our generation. I really hope that there are folks who can carry his spirit and push us to the lengths he imagined. 
He was a true fighter who beat all odds to contribute heavily to science and humanity as a whole.. Will be dearly missed
In an extremely painful irony, [Hawking doesn't appear to have said that](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/20/knowledge/). 
(from Hawking's 70th birthday speech at Cambridge)
You have no idea how much I needed this quote right now. RIP to a revolutionary man. 
"And not to sound preachy but if someone with such a condition didn't give up then we should have no reason to give up either. This person and his work I didn't really know but his name and illness is quite known. To think he lived that long and achieved so much puts my ""I can't do it"" back into perspective. Not that from now on I'll be the overachiever but at least I shouldn't complain when I know I didn't try hard. RIP."
He died on Einstein's birthday, and was born on Galileo's deathday.
I think there’s no way to really prepare for death. The shock is always there no matter what you do.   I think it’s the inevitability that’s the scariest part. Like you know it’ll happen but not when and that’s where the shock comes from. It’s reality crashing through like the Kool-Aid man.   May Hawking rest in peace like he deserves. Bless that man. But I think he died a good death; he got to see his life’s work completed and he had his family with him. He died loved. 
Truly incredible that he lived as long as he did
He was the epitome of r/nevertellmetheodds
"""My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus.""   \- Stephen Hawking"
A good run? I dream of having a run approaching a minuscule percentage of Stephen Hawking’s run.
Will be watching The Theory of Everything again
One of the world's most brilliant and beautiful minds has passed.  
That was beautiful
I agree. Children of the future are going to read textbooks about Stephen Hawking as we did about Albert Einstein in school, and to know you where on the same ground as that amazing man. For it to be an honor is an understatement. 
"A friend of mine went to an open day years ago at Cambridge university (at least I assume it was Cambridge, what with Stephen Hawking teaching there), and at one point he and all the prospective students were standing in the hallway asking Stephen Hawking questions;  ""How does it feel being the smartest man alive?""  ""Did it feel strange being so famous so young?""  ""What else are you working on at the moment?""  And what did my friend ask?  ""Um... how fast can you chair go?""  ""... I'll show you.""  And Steve zoomed off down the corridor."
On pi day no less :\(
It's not a miracle, it's thanks to the NHS.  He said it himself.
He truly will be remembered. Not many scientists have been in the public conscious like he has, not to mention having an acclaimed movie based on them while they're still alive. What an incredible life with his condition, IIRC he was given 2 years to live in 1963.
He's up there with greats like Carl Sagan who captured the public eye and used their platform to help advance society's interest in science 
Same, I just decided to check Reddit for only a minute and see this at the top. I sat there for a minute, just staring at the title.
It did for me. I’m sitting on the couch in my underwear and now I’m in tears, I didn’t even know I cared.
Also Einstein's birth date
Also the birthday of Albert Einstein. It's like one book that was opened long ago finally closed. Of all of the days this could happen, I can't find a more fitting day. I know I will be remembering Dr. Hawkings on pi day from now on.
I hardly know *anything* about Stephen Hawking beyond what I've learned in schools and I'm absolutely mortified     He always seemed like the kind of person you wanted to cheer for, given he accomplished like so much in his life with an extremely debilitating illness.    We'll miss you S.H. :(
I'm pretty sure he's already seen that way. 
Not many people are considered capable of holding the same professorship as Sir Isaac Newton.  I mean, man, that's incredible.  I remember him saying that his biggest regret was that his computer voice spoke with an American accent.  Heh.
Best wishes to your kitty.
'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ - Stephen Hawking
I love this, and it seems so much funnier in contrast to this news...
when i was learning the maths of hawking radiation, it felt so different than learning newton's or einstein's work. those guys always seemed mythical, whereas stephen hawking has always been so real. i am sad that he has gone, but he left a lot of good in his wake. 
That's why your here bud.  Keep us going, you got this!
> The world still needs him to keep us moving forward.  No, he has done his part and shared his knowledge.  Now it's our turn.
He will go down as one of the most influential minds of the century. Overcoming every obstacle in his insatiable pursuit for knowledge.
"""It’s clearly possible for a something to acquire higher intelligence than its ancestors: we evolved to be smarter than our ape-like ancestors, and Einstein was smarter than his parents. The line you ask about is where an AI becomes better than humans at AI design, so that it can recursively improve itself without human help. If this happens, we may face an intelligence explosion that ultimately results in machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails.""  Holy balls that's scary to think about"
I’ve read some articles speculating that he didn’t have “typical” ALS, but some variant that didn’t have the same rapid decline. 
My uncle died from ALS about 2 years ago. My aunt had thought his alcoholism was getting the best of him and he want to in patient treatment. His motor skills got a bit better after that. But he was still having problems. They went to a doctor to figure out what was going on. They found out about it sometime in September I think it was. It was so sad to see such a strong willed man just deteriorate like that over the course of a few months. We knew he didn't have long and his daughter was getting married in the spring but we had a ceremony at his home before he passed. He didn't last much longer after that. I took a video of the ceremony and at one point he looks back at me in the video and I can see how far gone he is when you look into his eyes it still haunts me a bit and I'll probably never show that video to anyone just because of how empty he looked at that point. 
To live 55 years with als is amazing. 
I'm sure he will continue inspire people for generations to come. The contributions he made to science in this very explosive time in scientific progress is astounding

The ALSA and the Stephen Hawking Foundation donation links have been edited into the main post.
I feel the need to draw the comparison between your statement and Christopher Reeve’s legacy as the Superman who became paralyzed in a chair similar in broad strokes to Hawking’s disability. Reeve said “I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.” Clearly Hawking was not ordinary, but he did achieve quite a lot in spite of incredible obstructions to normal life function.
"From the man himself: >“My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus."""
No, it’s people who are a whole lot better at faking it than they are.
It's also Pi Day, 3/14 = 3.14   Rather apropos considering
Hoping today another great mind is born. 
And loved by the world, not many can say that.
When people want a miracle I use Hawking as an example. What are the odds someone who wasn't supposed to live past their 20s would live to be 76, and not only blow most people away with his intelligence but pretty much reinvent how we saw the trait and who can have it? If he was born before recorded history the sensible thing to do would be to disregard him as a folktale because obviously someone just made him up. 
In fact, he held the record for the longest that any person has ever lived after a diagnosis for ALS. In 1963, they have him two years to live. He took fifty-five.  Professor Hawking did so much to advance science, both at the frontiers of physics and in its popularity among common folk. Some of his achievements may never be equaled, and his name will go down in history alongside those of Newton and Einstein. But I think Professor Hawking would agree with me in hoping that this is one accomplishment which is surpassed *very* soon.
Seriously, especially with the condition he had.
Especially considering he was given 2 years to live in 1963. 
"Time to dust off ""A Brief History of Time"""
ut rotam incipit vertere et dies non requiescent
We already do
Did he not come back? Because if that was his exit, that's pretty amazing,.
Pi day is now Hawking day.  edit: or Time Dilation day.
It’s not just thanks to the NHS, by all accounts he should have died long ago even with the best treatment available . He had an extremely rare slow progression form of the disease that was unheard of before him afaik. 
Tyson, Cox, Kaku, Thorne, Susskind... there are many others to carry on the popularization work.  There are also plenty of creators (including many professors) on YouTube making content that would never have been possible on TV.  EDIT: Cox is doing work at CERN. Kaku helped invent string theory. Thorne is a Nobel laureate. Susskind worked with and argued with Hawking. Even Tyson is a published scientist. These guys may not be exactly the same mix of unique features as Hawking, but they definitely rate with him. Some in terms of scientific achievement, others in terms of popularization.

Same, I was about to go to sleep too and now I'm sitting in bed crying reading all these threads :(
I didn't know either, but man this did hurt. You had an amazing life Stephen, I hope the stars are a step up.
And Stephen Hawking was born on Gallileo's death date. 
Thought she had cyst on her belly or breast cancer, turns out she is pregnant. It looked worse than what it is because she is so small. So at least she isn’t dying.

He was a funny dude
Now he is mythical and I'm sure to kids growing up learning the maths,  he will be mythical to them too
He will be remembered like Einstein

Wow, he also died on Rusev Day.
Rest assured, there is already born and very likely to be born the greatest mind of our species.   Dr. Hawking has paved the way for someone somewhere to surpass his achievements.
I totally agree. His contributions, given his state, are insurmountable. RIP 
He was given 2-5 years and lived for 55, not bad. Sorry to see him go.
It's also Einstein's birthday.  ^^edit: ^^it's ^^my ^^birthday ^^too!
As much as I love them, they're personalities. Educators and entertainers. Stephen is renowned and respected simply because of his discoveries. None of them can replace him.  He is the giant upon whose shoulders they stand.  EDIT: I didn't mean to say that they aren't scientists.

I started with being excited for pi day. Opened reddit to check pi day post and this is the first thing. It sucks but he has already done so much and inspired a generation of scientists it feels lucky to live in same time he did. RIP. 
Wouldn't it be nice to think, that maybe he's part of some Avatar cycle, and on this day, the next great scientist has been born.
also Einstein's birthday.... 
"""I call it a Hawking Hole."""
The world was really dealt a shit hand when he got ALS. Imagine a walking, talking SH who could smile and laugh with us. That's how I'll remember him, because he was that person at heart, and he has inspired multiple generations of people.
Truly. I remember him showing up in the big bang theory once. The guy's not only a brilliant man, but also a humorous one. RIP.
What a coincidence that Hawking and Einstein both died at the age of 76. Hawking died the day of Einstein's birthday too.
Hawking died on Einsteins birthday. both lived to the exact same age too
I just wish someone showed up to his time travelers party
...and back to star dust you shall return, good professor.
>His contributions, given his state, are insurmountable.  His contributions can indeed be mounted for we already stand on them. He was one of the giants that let us reach so far and see so clearly.

Both lived to be 76.
Yes. Or wormholes.
So he was born on the date Galileo died and died on the date Einstein was born?   Fitting for an astrophysicist. 
I think ALS was part of what made him who he was. Sometimes what seems to be a hinderance is actually a propellant. 
Yet even with ALS, he has done so much more with his life than I have ever. He was an inspirational man.
[He kept a model of himself that was based on his appearance on the Simpson's on his desk.](http://www.culture24.org.uk/asset_arena/0/70/27/372070/v0_master.jpg) The man knew how to take a joke. I really am going to miss him...

He was also born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo’s death. 
People did show up, but he couldn't tell anyone.
*X-Files theme starts*
Very fitting. Funny how the chaos of the universe lines up sometimes.
Hey, maybe Galileo died and reincarnated as Hawking, then Hawking died and reincarnated as Einstein. Time travel confirmed!
"He said as much.    https://www.biography.com/people/stephen-hawking-9331710  >In a sense, Hawking's disease helped him become the noted scientist he is today. Before the diagnosis, Hawking hadn't always focused on his studies. ""Before my condition was diagnosed, I had been very bored with life,"" he said. ""There had not seemed to be anything worth doing."" With the sudden realization that he might not even live long enough to earn his PhD, Hawking poured himself into his work and research. "
Anyone got the over/under on how long it’ll be until this ends up on the front page of r/TodayILearned ?
We just have to keep an eye out for the next major physicist in the next 30-50 years when he reincarnates again.

A great day for science and scientists around the world. As one of the speakers said, today one of our most incredible mathematical concepts went from an equation on the blackboard to a real image for everyone to see. Congratulations to all of those incredibly smart and dedicated people for showing us this wonder.
"Einstein **CONFIRMED AGAIN** but this time, under *extreme conditions*   ""Overall, the observed image is consistent withexpectations for the shadow of a spinning Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity.""   https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0f43/pdf    Einstein did it **AGAIN!**"
"Radio astronomer here!  This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it's one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!  Now what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can't escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the ""point of no return"" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn't actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can't escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it's estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).  Now, on a more fundamental level than ""it's cool to have a picture of a black hole,"" there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don't think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don't understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn't understand, and that we can't test in a lab on Earth because it's so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It's priceless!  Third, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one's data (after it's shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet's too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I'm frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I'm not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)  A final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at ""only"" 25,000 light years away.  M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years).  The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!  Anyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It's amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!  TL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.  Edit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn't also revealed today.  Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract.  It's not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it."
I remember how vague the information about black holes was when I was at school, 20 to 25 years ago. To be able to take a photo of this clarity a quarter of a century later is astounding!   I am very excited to read the implications of what this means for astrophysics, and what discoveries it may lead to.

May someone please ELI5 what we're seeing and the signifance?
While I was hoping it'd be Sag A, I really can't complain. It's a stunning image.
Interstellar got it right!
So is it right to say that the image is 54 million years old? (around the beginning of evolution of primates)
Neat that the Doppler shift on one side is so clear. What an image
Why does it have an accretion disk rather than an accretion shell? Does the angle of the accretion disk tell you something about the angular momentum inside the black hole or something?
Sad Stephen Hawking isn't alive to see this.
"""But the new EHT measurements show that its mass is about 6.5 billion solar masses.""  Let that sink in for a moment.  The sun is the ever present, dominant feature of our solar system.  Now take 6.5 billion more of them, roughly one for every person living on the earth, and cram them all into one spot.  Really puts into perspective our relative insignificance."
If only Hawking was still alive.
I can't begin to understand how he could come up with general relativity. It's just insane.
Is anyone able to ELI5 this for those of us who are interested, but are overall troglodytes when it comes to astrophysics? The PDF isn't loading for me for some reason.  Edit: I guess my question is pertaining to how this confirms the theory of relativity.
Is there some chart or list of all of Einstein’s predictions and which of them were true?
Was M87 chosen because the SMBH accretion disk is positioned in a plane that allows us to see it this way?
"You know it's a big day when /u/Andromeda321 says ""friggin'"""

It's the shadow of a supermassive black hole in a galaxy known as M87 on its accretion disk, the matter that swirls around a black hole  The significance: It's the first time we've ever seen this. It took a network of telescopes that spanned the globe to capture this. To reiterate: *It's the first actual picture, not a simulation, of a black hole*.
> “We’ve been studying black holes so long, sometimes it’s easy to forget that none of us have actually seen one,” France Cordova, director of the National Science Foundation, said in the Washington, D.C., news conference. Seeing one “is a Herculean task,” she said.   The significance is that we just took a picture of something 50 million light-years away that also absorbs light, and as such is essentially invisible to us. Every depiction of a black hole you've ever seen so far (film, media, digital renders, etc.) was someone's interpretation of what one would look like, whereas this is the real deal.
Congratulations on your contribution.
They just announced on the EU stream that they're currently in the process of analysing Sgr A*'s data, if I was paying the attention I think I was.
They had a lot of very smart people to consult on the science in that movie. If I recall correctly Dr. Brian Cox was even involved. The Black hole Gargantua was not an artists rendering but was actually a model characterization with as much real physics plugged in as they could manage.
How sad he did not get to see this.
If light doesn't change relative velocity, space and/or time must change to make it work
Einstein proposed the theory of General Relativity in 1915, which aimed to explain a lot of things about how gravity works, but was so ahead of its time, we're still confirming things that the equations describe. For the last 104 years, physicists all over the world have been conducting experiments to prove or disprove General Relativity.   Right now it's considered the accepted model of how gravity works in our universe, so you could say the experiments have gone in Einstein's favor (except for quantum gravity, where observations don't match what Einstein's equations predict. It's one of the reasons why, despite all the confirmations of General Relativity throughout the decades, people are still working on finding a unified quantum gravity theory: we're still missing the link between GR and quantum gravity). Using General Relativity, physicists have been able to predict how a black hole would look, and some indirect observations had matched these predictions, but nobody until today has been able to actually *see* a black hole. Turns out, this photo matches what Einstein's math says a black hole is supposed to look like.  I'm no historian, so I don't know what the knowledge of black holes was in 1915, but I do know that they were nothing more than a theoretical curiosity until the 1960s, and we still don't know much about them today. And Einstein *included black holes in his 1915 mathematical model.* Today's photo proves yet another aspect of Einstein's theory. He was right about something that would be impossible to prove until more than 100 years later!  Edit: added a bit more nuance, based on the comments below.  Edit 2: thanks for the gold, stranger!
This is the first ever 'real' image of a black hole ever taken. Real meaning not a simulation or an artist rendering. This image was taken using radio telescopes positioned across the entire earth and formed by stitching together petabytes of data until an accurate and coherent image of the black hole was formed. The redish yellow in the image is the light surrounding the event horizon and the black dot in the middle is the actual black hole.
Your GPS  http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html  is one big one.   Off the top of my head I forget. There have been so many. The entire field of Cosmology is pretty hinged on Einstein. Once you get past Mars, Einstein takes over.
No, they didn't know the orientation of the black hole, it was pure speculation.  The reason it was chosen is besides our own supermassive black hole in the Milky Way, Sag A*, it's literally the only other one close and massive enough to be imaged from Earth.
I hope someone will correct me because this is just a semi-educated guess, but due to the bending of space-time around the hole, isn't the disk \*always\* positioned in such a way that we can see it? i.e. the black hole would look like that from any angle
Mea culpa, I'll edit it!
Gal. :)  But, they are (probably) not holes!  It's a name because it's a hole of information from which information and light cannot escape.
Thank you kindly.
Do we know if this photo would match what we'd see in person? Like would we actually see this blurriness look in real life, or is it just because it's a still photo of the gas that's moving so fast?  Thanks for the responses! Love how I can get so many different ways of explaining things.

Thanks!   What are we hoping to learn from this?
This comment is cracking me up. I get the home reference, and I'm with you.   It's just hilarious to me. It's 25,000 light years away. And when I break that down to something I can grasp it's so astronomically far.  That means that if we got in a spaceship that was fast enough to go the speed of light. Fast enough to go around the planet 7.5 times in one second. It would take 25,000 years to get there.  The average life span is ~ 70 years.   It would require ~ 356 life spans going as fast as theoretically possible to get there.  It's so far away. And you just called it home.  Space is ridiculous.
Kip Thorne worked on Interstellar as part of the imaging if I remember correctly -- he was also on the team with LIGO that detected the gravity waves.
Brian Cox may have participated as well, but the most notable science advisor on the movie would be Kip Thorne, who [literally wrote the book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Holes_and_Time_Warps) on black holes.  The Gargantua image in the movie was modified a bit to remove the red/blue shifting of the accretion disc and to smooth out the disc a bit. (As well as, apparently, adding some light bloom and lens flare effects.)
r/ForbiddenSnacks
Man, that’s sad. We were so close while he was alive, but we just missed it.  Edit: We as in “humanity” I suppose. Also yes, it’s possible he saw a photo like this before any of us. He would have liked to see a picture like this being shared though I’m sure.
In a way, he saw it before any of us could even begin to wrap our head around the concept. He was able to visualize something so complex, something that most of us will never experience in our own minds.  So in a way, he was the one living in the light, while all of us were in the dark. We’re only seeing an image – *a glimpse* – of what he understood and envisioned.  Truly inspiring.
Imagine having the revelation that the speed of light is constant in this universe. It's an idea that we accept now a days, but you had to be complete badass to come to that conclusion and not just assume its complete nonsense. It's an assumption that is 100% counter intuitive to our understanding of physics up until that time...
"> I'm no historian, so I don't know what the knowledge of black holes was in 1915  I recently discovered that the first notion of black holes dates back actually to 1784! John Michell wrote in a letter:  ""If there should really exist in nature any bodies, whose density is not less than that of the sun, and whose diameters are more than 500 times the diameter of the sun, since their light could not arrive at us; or if there should exist any other bodies of a somewhat smaller size, which are not naturally luminous; of the existence of bodies under either of these circumstances, we could have no information from sight; yet, if any other luminous bodies should happen to revolve about them we might still perhaps from the motions of these revolving bodies infer the existence of the central ones with some degree of probability, as this might afford a clue to some of the apparent irregularities of the revolving bodies, which would not be easily explicable on any other hypothesis; but as the consequences of such a supposition are very obvious, and the consideration of them somewhat beside my present purpose, I shall not prosecute them any further.""  So there you go, one more for the ""he would have been really happy to see this"" list."
I don't think I was clear in my question.  How does this confirm the theory of relativity again is what I meant to ask.
Wouldn't we know the orientation of the black hole from the direction of the jet it spits out? Isn't M87 the one with the huge ass relativistic jet? I would've thought that would have came from one of the rotational poles.
Based on the veritasium video I watched about this yesterday yeah you should always be able to see it. It was a great video, he demonstrated how it should look really well.
>  If an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible, he is almost certainly right; but if he says that it is impossible, he is very probably wrong.   Arthur C. Clarke
Neither. In person, it would look like a sharp ring. The blurriness is due to limitations on the angular resolution we can get with this number of telescopes, this far away, looking at this specific wavelength of light.
We confirmed Einsteins predictions about general relativity, and we hope to find study these black holes to see where general relativity breaks down (because GR isn't consistent with quantum mechanics, for example)
The observation was made in 2017 (if i have understood the articles correctly), so he may very well have seen it. He surely must have had the connections required to get an early look.
"[**Michelson–Morley experiment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment#Special_relativity)  An experiment being conducted to detect the speed of earth relative to the ""aether"", by detecting the difference in the speed of lights in different directions. But the experiment failed. The speed of light came out to be constant and independent of direction.  They found that there was, in fact, no substantial difference in the measurements.  RESULT: SPEED OF LIGHT IS SAME IN EVERY FRAME OF REFERENCE.  This is what could have led Einstein to think that speed of light is constant. But some people say that Einstein was never really aware of the Michelson-Morley experiment   Einstein could have taken this as the starting point for relativity."
Hell, it's still counterintuitive based on normal day to day life. A car coming at you at 60 mph looks like it approaches you at 120 mph if you're driving towards it at 60 mph too, and if it's driving away from you and you're driving in the same direction at 50 mph, it looks like it's driving away from you at 10 mph.  The idea that light doesn't follow that same fundamental, commonplace rule is weird af.

Relativity dictates what an image of a black hole should look like.  This image matches predictions.
Until we observed one, we had no way of knowing if the jet does, in fact, orient that way.  Simulations said they did, but that's no equivalent for direct observation.
Why/how does this image confirm the relativity theory?

"Neil Gaiman of all people has supposed that the style of writing ""pre-typewriter"" is due in part to the implement most often used to write at the time (i.e., a dip pen or quill pen). The idea is that you'd have to re-wet your pen constantly, and pausing would cause it to dry out.

If you do the math/physics around a black hole you should get a cloud of gas near the black hole, and that's exactly what we see.
The situation around a black hole is WAAAAY more extreme -- any deviations from GR should be way more obvious.

The math is hard.  But it seems easy enough to ELI5.  Look at the picture.  Two things should stick out as very strange:  * The black circle in the middle * The fact that the ring is much brighter on one side  There are possibly more mundane explanations for the dark area.  I mean... who knows... Maybe it's a gigantic umbrella.  But what in the world explains the ring?  And that ring is very, ***very*** large, by the way.  Well... that's part of what relativity predicted.  A very simplified version is that the stuff spinning around the black hole is going very, very fast.  So fast that the light from it does the same weird thing that a train horn does when it zooms towards you, passes you and goes away from you.  Beyond that it gets very weird very quickly.  For example, that ring isn't spinning around like a record that you're looking down on.  It's a sphere spinning around and one side is spinning towards you and the other side is spinning back around again.  But if that's the case... why can you only see the fringe of that sphere?!?  To answer that is to move beyond ELI5, but that also was what was predicted.
So that picture in the middle, now that we've seen the actual photo, is almost 100% exactly what a black hole looks like?
in my town they recently decriminalized marijuana, one of the benefits has been that now they don't have to test marijuana they have seized and it is clearing up lab time for rape kits, which had been backing up.
And more criminals relaxing and eating instead of... being criminals?
Well considering one of the reason marijuana was made illegal was to persecute the black and Hispanic populations, I don't think you're too far off from the mark
There are a lot of industries that could potentially stand to lose sales/customers with the legalization of weed: alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, religion, just to name a few. 
sadly Not in CO... Denver, Co has a horrible track record there..     since legalization.. they actually removed the civilian oversight from the ability to investigate officers.   the ~~Chief~~ mayor likes to sext his Police subordinates, *the chief fires them for reporting it*. *EDited for correctness*  they ignore the health and safety in denver county jail,  let people die in custody constantly, hell they made some lady give birth in her cell and refused medical attention.   denver pd/sheriffs is about as scummy as you can get..   cant harass kids for pot anymore? time to sexually harass, beat or shoot someone instead, and if all else fails, we'll let them literally rot to death in jail.  of course .. Internal investigations clear them .. until the lawsuit the following year reveals all, meanwhile the AG will pay to defend it ofc.   
Decriminalization keeps the black market alive. Legalize it and tax it. Take that money and invest in its infrastructure. Rehabs. Healthcare. And education.   Decriminalization does not work.   Edit: I added “and education”, which may be the most important part of legalization. 
Who's to say that the marijuana lobby won't grow big enough to throw its own influence around?  Not that that's a turn of events that should be necessary, but still. 
"I don't know which is worst:  - testing marijuana is not a lower priority than potential rape  - that they test to confirm it's marijuana in the first place  - there are enough rapes in your home town to get ""backed up"" at the lab"

Don't forget about those evil, commie hippies.
I also heard it was made illegal because the opposite gender of marijuana (male or female I'm not sure, but the one that doesn't get you high) is used to make hemp, a fat cheaper and quicker variety of paper, and basically, loggers and paper making companies (not the real name I know, paper press? I dunno) bribed the government into banning because they were already well established and hemp would destroy the logging business, the government then accepted under the condition that they pay a higher tax on logging to keep the bribe beneficial for both parties.      I can't remember where or when I saw this, but I swear I heard it somewhere.      There seems to be a lot I don't remember in this post, blame the government!       Where's my tinfoil hat gone? oh yeah, I'm wearing it
While I'd prefer that, for the US decriminalization would be a baby step in the right direction.
Eh, more money in practice almost always means more candidates; more candidates, so you can be more discretionary in hiring, and more comfortable with dismissals for bad behavior or mistakes.  Also, police are ubiquitous. A high salary job where you can live pretty much anywhere...  Well, some police forces already have very high salaries. Incidentally the best funded forces tend to be in high income areas, right? . . .so the crime rates are naturally lower . . . and the candidates are better . . . which pushes the worse police candidates to the lower paying, worse areas . . .where all the problems are . . .

the reason they were targeted was because they were/are antiwar. vietnam was pushed for almost entirely by the military industrial complex. 
This is it. It was targeted because you can make anything out of hemp and the tree/cotton industries did not like that. Cheap, easy to grow and very easy to manufacture goods with. It just so happens that you can get a buzz from it so they targeted that. Blacks and hispanics just tended to use it more than any other race.

Your post describes my situation, I am a graduate student who came back to the US for my studies.

"Student loan debt is the next bubble we are sitting on and it's going to screw over an entire generation of kids. These loans are worth more than mortgages for some kids. I understand that they should be going into majors where they can make that money back, but it's unrealistic to assume every single person wants to be a doctor or engineer. People should be smart about the loans they take out, but the loans shouldn't be 200k for a 4 year bachelors degree.      Add the fuel to the fire that is the inability to write off grad loans and it's absolutely going to pop that bubble sooner than later. It's inexplicable.         EDIT: So I posted this at work and didn't have time to really check on it after a few replies and it suddenly became my highest upvoted comment to date. I just wanna thank my mom, my brothers, and my pet cat Dexter. But I also wanna say a few things. One, I am in absolutely **no way** specialized in this field of talk. I have rudimentary understandings of virtually everything I know in life so I apologize if anything in the original post was misinformed aka my terminology of this being a ""bubble"". Basically this cannot by definition be a bubble because the goods being bought with these loans cannot be traded and or refunded (I think? did I get that right guys?).     As far as the idea that people should be more responsible when taking out loans: I agree *to an extent*. I think parents and teachers of this generation (one which gets bashed at every possible moment) need to step the fuck up and teach their kids proper financing. I'm lucky that my mother did this for me. We weren't born into money but my mother worked her ass off with 4 kids to get her Masters in medicine to become a nurse practitioner, but that didn't happen until I was about 14 so she taught us good money habits from a super young age. BUT, even she didn't understand this college loan shit. Not until she started paying for some of it to help us out did she really understand what was happening. So, I think parents with kids that are 13-17 at the moment should be talking to their kids about student loans **right the fuck now**. Not about what they wanna be when they grow up. Not about what school they want to go to. But about how much money this entire system drains you of.     That's all from me for the night I might try replying to some more of you but I really didn't expect this comment to blow the fuck up. Make good choices and do good things y'all!  "
I'm a PhD student in the bay area. My University tuition is ~$45K/year.  I pay $2.1K/mo on rent for myself and my wife (who makes about ~$25K per year). This rent is *very* reasonable for a couples studio.  If this bill passes as written, our household taxable income will be about $90K, which is absolutely insane for the money we bring home.   EDIT:   In case others did not know, I also have my own graduate stipend.
Why is nobody talking about the educational institutions part in this equation?  The PhD folks on here are acting like they are powerless because now they'll have to pay taxes on the actual value of the income the receive in the form of reduced / subsidized education when all the while the University you attend is making PROFIT off of the student's teaching other students.  The university is foregoing paying tons of money on their employees by using a form of indentured servitude to fill their staffing needs.  As an employer, they aren't paying their matched part of the tax equation, no social security benefits, unemployment insurance, etc, because they're using the PhD candidates to do work for them.  All of this from a FOR PROFIT company, the University.  I would LOVE to have a business where I could pretend that I charge $50k / year to 'teach' my employees the tools of the trade for several years and flat out not pay them (or any of my tax burden) all the while my 'employees' are earning me profit...
"""...will leave USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia.""  Uhh, did we forget about Canada? Could use you guys over here, honestly. "

Hey guys, I am not familiar with US tax laws, however my sister is pursuing her PhD in the US (NY to he exact), and I'm planning to go there for my masters degree next fall as well.  Terribly sorry to bother y'all with this, but can someone please ELI5 what this new tax proposal means for grad students (masters and PhD's)?   Thank you, and again, really sorry, but I don't understand a lot of the technicalities here. :)
"this is going to get buried but another issue that many miss is that PhD students often don't take classes after about 2 years and are forced to register for a 0 credit ""class"" that shows the university they are still a student. During this time they are teaching classes (for a salary of 20k/year) and working on research projects under grants. Oh and by the way, when these big grants come in, the university takes half of that money in the form of ""overhead rate"".   Last year I took zero classes and was charged ~$30,000 in tuition (which of course was waived). This means I will be taxed on an additional 30k without ever taking a course at the university during that year. "
There’s a GOP push right now to cut taxes for the wealthiest corporations, but increase taxes specifically for individual democrat-leaning voters. That why they’re going after grad students and states with higher state taxes (making those higher taxes no longer deductible).
"This whole thing highlights the absurdity of the shell game that Universities play with PhD. students.  In the first 1-2 years I could see where they have a point. The student takes real classes from real professors. Your tuition waiver as a PhD student gives you those classes for free. So you can say you did receive something of value you weren't taxed on.  However, once these class requirements are fulfilled, the PhD. student is now a full time research a assistant. A reasonable person might expect that the student now gets the money that used to go to their classes. Nope! They get a small pay bump of a few thousand a year when they make this status change.  In effect, once the ""student"" becomes a full research assistant their pay is cut massively because they aren't getting the full benefit of their tuition waiver anymore. However, the ""student"" needs to keep their student status so they make the ""student"" register for ""thesis/research credits"" which are billed at the same rate as real classes. But there is no classroom, no curriculum no homework, no exams. It's just there to keep student status but they charge for this and then waive it! The student is no longer receiving any value, in fact they are receiving negative value! And now they want to tax this negative value? This is insane."
It is worth noting the Senate version of the tax bill does not include a plan to tax tuition waivers.  Further, it is worth remembering that the tuition waivers are largely a trick of financial accounting. PhD students get their tuition paid for in exchange for TA-ing or some similar activity. The colleges and universities like this arrangement because it is tax advantageous for them. But they could just as easily award the PhD students a scholarship instead of a tuition waiver. Or - gasp - they could pay them a fair wage for the work they do.  That’s why I’m not too up in arms about this bill.  1. I doubt that the final bill will tax tuition waivers.  2. The real problem here is universities exploiting cheap, graduate labor. I’d rather we focus on that problem.
Is there a political subreddit that people actually discuss important issues like tax reform rather than lobbing character accusations? I consider myself a left leaning independent and am in a pretty much all blue district. I would love to hear from a conservative who thinks that this plan is a good idea and why. 
"I don't think it is fair to just throw the ""300% "" in the room without even mentioning HOW the increase works.  The taxhike is done by taxing graduate students who get their tuition as gift from the university.  Universities get around paying higher wages by basically deducting the tuition fee from the wage, but not calling it that. They just ""forgive"" the tuition fee, thus allowing them to pay lower wages, because students don't have to require wages to pay that tuition out of.  For the system that means basically the tuition gets removed from the system twice. As part of the wage, and as part of the revenue of the universities.  **The outrage**: Taxing things that you DIDN'T pay. If that logic was broadly applied, homeless people would have to pay taxes for meals received at the soup kitchen. If you get anything for free as promotion, or gift. that would all have to be declared as income. Which is on one level ludicrous. (even more absurdly: Technically if you get a tax deduction, it would have to be counted as taxable income, which is the outcome of taxing things you DIDN'T earn.....). It creates a giant question mark in terms of ""perks of a job"". What kind of benefits to you by having a certain job should be quantified and taxed? How about a company car? Do you have to declare that? Do you apply ""common leasing rates""?  **The justification**: You can't just remove ANY gift from taxation, because it allows for massive tax evasion. There is a difference for the system whether you get peanuts as wages but board and food as ""gift"", or getting a proper wage that gets taxed and have to PAY for accommodation and for your food (each being taxed as income for the provider)  In this case the universities basically are skirting their dues by artificially reducing their revenue (tuition fees not taken in) but compensating it with lower wages, thus reducing the payroll tax on the students side.  **The flaw**: THe flaw is that this AGAIN is  putting the pressure on the weakest people IN this situation, by now taxing the forgiven tuition as income, as IF they had received it as income and then paid it, thus making receiving the waiver unattractive, thus forcing the students to demand wages that allows them to PAY the tuition, which then gets taxed as revenue on the universities side.   edit: Additional flaw: It doesn't work. The workaround for the university is to increase the wages by JUST the amount the students have to pay as taxes, this STILL doesn't force them to pay taxes on their forgiven revenue (basically implying that universities are lobbying hard enough to skirt THAT part of the problem)  **Solution**: If the goal is to prevent universities to apply this trick, but not want to punish the students, the tuition would have to be tax deductible. Basically the whole problem only arises because of for-profit education to begin with.  **Additional observation**: The above is independent from observations or disagreement of how the actual tax burden is distributed in the US. It doesn't address how the worst offenders against the common good get the most lenient tax deductions and lowest taxes, or why specifically for profit education is under the microscope here, rather than other ways to avoid contributing to society.  **Tl;dr** :  Just calling it a 300% increase is dishonest and misses the issue in an effort to foster outrage."
"Dumb question...  couldn't the schools fight back and claim tuition is super cheap, so the students don't pay taxes on ""income?""  There has to be a way around this nonsense. "
I wonder how this affects student athletes with tuition waivers. We might get more traction pointing out the damage this will do to college football programs than getting congress to sympathize with PhD students. 
Isn’t this a problem with the system and not graduate students? The issue is Grad students have their own loophole. Shouldn’t ideally we close the loophole, tax grad students, and also address why the education they are getting is valued so highly? Through some combination of lowering education costs and paying grad students more?
This is a marginalization of academics and our country will pay for it for years to come. 
You describe my situation seven years ago perfectly. If I could do it again, I'd do my grad school in Germany for free instead of going into dollar-denominated debt, but hindsight is 20/20.
Are PhDs in Germany free for international students.
You're welcome here in Germany. Europe has many great science opportunities. We're not going to make your life harder, and, most importantly, we respect you and your work.
The good news is that the Senate version of this bill does not tax tuition waivers. It is unlikely that the final bill will either, since it is more likely to conform to the Senate version (since the GOP has a smaller majority in that chamber).  That said, the real villains here are the universities. They are benefit from this arrangement. They are enormously tax advantages to ‘pay’ grad students with tuition waivers (no social security, no unemployment etc.) and they get to pay the principle salary in fake tuition money.
And we would lose the competitive edge that creative people like you give us.

My school pays relatively well but when we last hired, we had shit candidates. Making a master's cost more is just another way to slowly erode public education.
People are already pushed away from being educators by all of the ridiculous hoops you have to jump through. Like I wanted to be a math teacher. But that means 2 more years of school, $60k+ more of debt, and half the salary that I'd made as an engineer. It's just not practical.
Teachers will also no longer be able to deduct expenses for purchasing classroom supplies in the new bill.
i realize we're in r/science here, but STEM people need to not talk about this as though it's only a problem for them. this is an issue for all grad students, from law to humanities to education to business to STEM and beyond. this should be a time to look outside our disciplines and band together, not become tribal or have blinders on. i've heard people say that the fact this is affecting STEM will somehow make people outside academia react since the tune is usually that engineering, etc. is the sacred cow of jobs and humanities are a joke, but dismissing by omission such a significant part of higher ed is a bad tactic. /u/nate I think you should revise your post to reflect this. more than just scientists are shocked by this.
It won't likely affect them because masters students rarely get tuition wavers.

> Student loan debt is the next bubble we are sitting on and it's going to screw over an entire generation of kids.   It’s a bubble. Also a bubble: [the schools themselves have billions in outstanding debt](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/10/07/with-low-interest-universities-turn-to-bonds/). There’s a weird situation where you are taking out loans to pay a school who has taken out loans.   I’ve often thought that the student loan bubble would be a long painful deflation, not a pop. But if the tax bill causes a drop in admissions which prevents schools from keeping up with the interest in those bonds, that will hurt. Add that to the [tax on endowments](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/453545/university-endowments-tax-terrible-idea), and you have the recipe for a pop within the next few years. 
>it's unrealistic to assume every single person wants to be a doctor or engineer.   It is also unrealistic to assume that every college student could become a doctor or engineer and for those professions to continue to provide well-paying careers. 
Actually, this bill will worsen the situation for undergraduates. Many classes in most disciplines at large state universities are staffed by graduate students who depend on the tuition waivers. No tuition waivers will mean no grad students to teach those classes, so we'll have a severe shortage of teachers at the college level. Class sizes will increase, classes will disappear, it will take longer to get the courses students need to graduate, costs to undergraduates will rise significantly. This bill is going to majorly, and negatively, impact many people who want an *undergraduate* degree.
The debt is over 1.5 trillion. 1,500,000,000,000!   That's not a bubble that will burst. It's not dischargeable. That is going to be a long term anchor on the US economy.   And not everyone wants to go into STEM, sure, but even those hat do are in trouble. There are far more STEM grads every year than there are jobs.

Not to mention you can't write of state income taxes anymore with this bill
Federal income tax for a couple making $90K is about $20K.  For a couple taking home $45K in cash that's 44.4% which is higher than the highest tax bracket which starts at $400K and is 39.6% Waved tuition is not income.  You can't pay buy bread with waived tuition, you can't pay rent with waived tuition, and treating it like income is the same as treating scholarships that pay for tuition like income.
When I was working on my masters, my stipend was about $20k/yr, and my tuition benefit worth about $35k. *Total* tax (federal income, state income, and FICA) on the $20k is right now around $2,500, leaving me with $17,500. If I was taxed based on the tuition benefit, that would be $11,000, leaving me with $9,000. Tax rate goes from 12.5% to 55%.
I feel like I am missing something.  You household income is about ~70k but under the new bill they can tax you as if you were making ~90k?   How does that make any sense? That's insane, please tell me I am missing something.
Do you mind if I borrow this comment and adapt it to send to congressmen? It's very well stated and explains the situation very clearly.

THANK YOU FOR POSTING RESIST BOT!!!!!!!!!!!  I am usually a very busy person and this is my perfect alternative to make sure I can send letters to senate. Wow!
So why don't legislators come up with something that pointedly addresses that issue, rather than doubling the tax burden on graduate students and hoping that the universities pick up the slack? I agree with you for what it's worth, but I don't think this legislation is meant to fix that issue at all...and I don't think these legislators actually care about that.   It's all about political expediency...graduate students are too busy and too poor to lobby, universities aren't. 
Yeah the tuition waiver is kind of a joke. The university charges me tuition and then pays it. The money is not “income” for me, and is basically just circulating within the university. They are paying themselves. 
Immigration to Canada is said to be very difficult
Elections have consequences.  Voting matters.
And at the same time, at the other end of the GOP platform, they're yelling and screaming about all those immigrants coming in and taking Americans' jobs. So let's fix that by exponentially reducing the number of qualified American candidates graduating with higher degrees so that if any company wants to fill any job that requires more than an undergrad, they'll have to hire in from out of the country. 
PhDs will be charged taxes on their tuition waivers. So if you make a 30k stipend and have 40k in tuition waived you will pay taxes as though you made 70k. This means you are looking at a total tax bill (after state/fica) ~50% of your stipend.
Grad students get paid almost nothing but one thing they do get is free or reduced tuition. That tuition discount will be treated as income in the proposed tax plan. This will greatly increase student's taxes. But treating tuition discounts as income won't accurately represent how much money students get paid, so they won't be able to easily afford their taxes.
Conversely, the protests that ADAPT put on were completely instrumental in stopping the healthcare bills they wanted to pass this year. I'm not sure I trust the lobbyist to actually tell us what effective forms of resistance are.
Unfortunately, cutting tuition isn't that simple, as it would financially ruin many universities, or their undergraduate students.  The reason is that the university **is** being paid tuition even when it's waived. Instead of the money coming from the student, it comes from either their professor's research grant, or from endowment foundation, who can only use money for specific reasons (one of which is paying these waived tuitions).  So in a large state school with ~15k graduate students, assuming around 10k have their tuition waived, the university would lose $200M that they'd have to cover somehow else. They could increase undergraduate tuition by $5-10k each, or drastically cut TA staff, or sell the library to Walmart, or something like that, but the end result is that it would all be pretty terrible for the undergraduate population who will inevitably foot the bill.
This is one of the most despicable things that the GOP has ever tried to do.  At least in the case of their ACA repeal it would have fucked people regardless of party.   But this is pure political patronage. This is how unstable tribalistic governments work, when one tribe gains power they lavish benefits on their fellow tribesmen at the direct expense of the out tribes. This kind of behaviour has been what has lead to so much turmoil in the middle east and many African countries.  This is how a country devolves into civil war. When it becomes a winner take all attitude.   The Democrats have been very careful to avoid doing things like this. There is a reason why the ACA disproportionately benefits rural areas and older people. They felt they had to do this in order to avoid the perception that they were trying to hurt Republicans.

Yes, you can try r/NeutralPolitics. But this is a huge overhaul being pushed through Congress very quickly, with significant disparities even between the House and tentative Senate versions, so there are going to be a lot of details like this that just don't have time to get much attention outside the affected groups and might not have fully fleshed out discussions. It's entirely plausible that this problem didn't even occur to the authors of the bill.
"They could, but they probably won't. The way that universities manage tuition waivers now is that they ""waive"" tuition for the student but are still receiving that money from grants or other sources. So it would be a financial hit for the universities to just lower tuition."
Right now I'm not going into debt for graduate school,  I'm lucky enough to be funded by the university but that is **just barely** enough to survive.   In fact it isn't. I'm only able to make it work with the help of family and my amazing girlfriend. If my income gets cut by any amount, not to mention a tax burden increase of possibly 300%, I just won't be able to continue .
Fees are negligibly small, but you need to see how you afford living. Many (but not all) PhD positions come with an employment at the faculty and you're allowed to use part of your working hours for your research.
I honestly couldn't tell you, I left because the post grad system for the Humanities in Germany was abysmal. I didn't even think about the finances because all the (german) faculty told me I would have to look at England or a few schools elsewhere if I wanted to pursue Graduate work in Europe.  I loved living in Germany so if I couldn't stay I decided to just go home, now it appears I may lose that option too.
it is so sad to see you guys over the ocean being screwed so hard by your own people. as a german grad student, i sincerely hope that this  trend of anti-scientism will not become a global issue, but as long as things are still good here in germany or the EU in its whole, feel welcome to come and stay here. for science!

"It's so then they can point to the ""failing public schools"" as an excuse to privatize it."
Isn’t eroding public education kind of this administration’s agenda? Pushing charter schools etc?
It'll erode public education which is what these politicians want, but private schools are going to hurt as well when they don't have qualified teachers. What are these people thinking? 
"As an engineer who tried education, I completely agree. It was the biggest mistake I've ever made.  I spent $20k on a teaching degree (that I was told would be forgiven if I taught, but later found that I still had to make payments for the first 5 years). After taking classes for 2 semesters, I had to go through student teaching. Unlike in industry, where I was paid for my internship (more take-home than when I taught actually), I had to pay *full tuition* while student teaching, was forbidden by my university to get a job on the side, and couldn't even get sub pay when my mentor teacher was out for a day.  It's so completely disconnected from reality. The whole time I was in it, everybody from teachers, professors, administrators, etc. bitched about the ""massive shortage of STEM teachers"", but nobody seemed to get how the world works. If engineers made $40k per year after getting (required) masters degrees, had to buy all their supplies (down to the point of buying paper, pens, etc.), and were expected to take work home, there would be a massive engineer shortage too. That's why engineers get paid pretty well. Same with doctors, lawyers, and really anybody else in a highly paid white collar job. But with teachers, it is clearly the fault of the training programs.   The school where I got my teacher training recently announced a program where you a 5 year (ba+ma) program called ""teacher residency"" to fix the problem. Instead of making it remotely financially viable for STEM majors to go into teaching, it now takes 5 years to get a teaching degree (meaning 5 years of tuition), a year-long ""teacher residency"" which is an unpaid internship, and a masters degree. The problem is that the difference between BA and MA pay is like $3 grand. Since tuition is roughly $15 grand (let's assume 6% student loan interest) and you lose a year of $32k pay while you do it, your total lost income is $52k. Since your income difference is about $3k per year, it will take 17 years to *break even*.   Needless to say, after suffering through a year of teaching, I dropped it like a hot rock and went back into industry."
I wonder where all that money goes to. Here in Germany education is (mostly) free and it's not lacking major things.
The fact that teachers have to do this in the first place is a national embarrassment. 
Was already sad that is was only $250. Average teachers spend $500, and not uncommon to be $1000. Actually it's more sad that they even need to spend out of pocket money for stuff like glue and books. 
"> There’s a weird situation where you are taking out loans to pay a school who has taken out loans.  I'd just like to clarify that you are misunderstanding the article. The schools they cite are not ""in debt"" in that they have net negative assets or in financial trouble.   Schools like Harvard and Yale are flush with cash. What is happening is that the schools are using a common finance techniques to create leverage for their investments. Companies like Apple, Wall Street investment banks, etc. all have billions of outstanding debt. (Apple has $89 billion in long term debt based on their Q-10 filing.)   This does not mean that they have net negative assets or are in financial trouble. They are taking advantage of low interest rates, currency exchange rates, or dodging taxes. It is analogous to a person with $1 million dollars in his bank account taking a $500,000 loan.   Big name universities like Harvard and Yale operate exactly the same as big Wall Street banks in terms of investment. They have fund managers being paid millions of dollars per year and everything. It actually really bothers me how universities get a free pass from criticism (such as for overcharging tuition) simply because they are universities.  "
"ELI5: What will happen when it ""pops"".  But a pragmatic guess, not a fear mongering answer that says ""riots, massive recession ect.."""
If you want to make engineering lower-paying, graduate 3x the engineers your society needs.
"The biggest issue isn't that everyone wants to be a STEM major, or there's a surplus (or not) of people trained in these high-paying fields, it's that there are so few ""high paying"" fields.    There's only a few career choices for someone that wants to make a slightly above-average wage and live the middle American dream of a house, 2.5 kids, and a dog, and we've come to a place where, barring extraordinary circumstances, you **must** have at least a bachelor's degree to get those jobs.    But jobs are limited and those fields are notoriously competitive.    We could take so much pressure off those ""high paying"" career choices by figuring out some way that **everyone** can make a livable wage, even without a college degree.  I don't know the answer, but I think a combination of an inflation-indexed minimum wage and some sort of basic income is heading in the right direction.  Unfortunately, I'm not an economist, nor I am truly qualified to have an opinion on the solution."
My university is panicking because we've already pre-enrolled thousands of undergrads in next year's lab courses - i.e. for the 2018-19 academic year. We've got 5000+ students signed up for the intro bio labs already and we were counting on grad students teaching all of those labs. Every last pre med, pre dental, pre nursing, pre vet, occupational therapy, exercise science undergrad and about 40 other majors have ALL of their labs taught by PhD students who are dependent on tuition waivers. But about half the grad students will have to drop out of grad school if tuition waivers become taxable. In that event I don't see any way we can keep the 2018-19 labs running. It'll be a real crisis; we'll either have to drop labs entirely (which massively screws the undergrads because med school, dental school etc. require labs) or refund tuition to thousands of undergrads. The same problem will play out at every large state university - essentially a near-complete collapse of ability to train the next generation of doctors, nurses, dentists, veterinarians, PTs, you name it. Just about every health-related career will be affected.  We've also got major federal grants running - NSF's, NIH's, more - that all have grad students written into the budget at a certain rate, but those grad students are going to disappear and then god only knows how we'll get the research done (hint: we won't). Such a clusterfuck on so many levels.
Can confirm. Graduated with a STEM degree only to get an entry level industry job that pays $31,000 a year. That would be enough to live comfortably except for the $300 a month student loan payment, and the fact that I didn’t want to get a cheap apartment in the hood. 
If you go read any college related thread these days, most people seem to think that education and college are a scam and you should just go learn a trade because your 'philosophy degree won't get you anything'.   There are a bunch of benefits to college but it's pretty clear a significant amount of people view it as some kind of political tool now.
Yuck...If you're a PhD student in a blue state who adopted a child, this bill is going to hit you from a few angles... 
Fuck, they're gonna start taxing scholarships now too. All those kids who get a full ride to an ivy league are gonna start getting taxed more than the total combined income of their parents. 
the long and the short of it is that they want to tax the tuition being waived as though it were your income. So his stipend is 20K (working backwards), and his wife takes in 25K, so as a couple they actually make 45K. But this bill would tax the 45K of his waived tuition as though it were income, and put them into the tax bracket for a 90K income even though they've only actually got $45K for income. 
Sure. :)
"They're using it as a write-off by doing it this way. They get to show a bunch of ""loss"" by giving you that tuition waiver. It helps them maintain not for profit status (which allows some profits, but has specific requirements on it). "
Get accepted to a post grad school in Canada. Graduate. Then you are eligible for a 3 year open work permit in Canada. Use your time and work experience towards getting your PR (Canada’s green card.) Stay a while.. stay forever!
"I'm from the Midwest and let me tell you, the people who vote this way often think education is overrated, that academics are oblivious jerks who live in ivory towers, and that all we need for a ""good life"" is the Bible and a plot of land to grow food on.   For a sizable chunk of the Republican voter base, destroying academia would be a good thing."
Wow that is waaaay worse that I expected.
"I'm a grad student at the UofM. can't the U just increase the stipend by the same amount as the tax or convert my tuition waiver into a ""fellowship"" or a ""gift"" so that it's not considered tax anymore ?"
"Yeah, I'm not sure I buy the, ""Do not picket/protest"" part of this. My rep could care less what I think, but might care about negative news coverage in his district."
I was on a knife edge myself, then I found out that my compensation package was...I will be charitable...somewhat confusingly worded. So I found myself scrambling to cover a 10,000 dollar shortfall. So shit happens and I'll be paying for it until...let's see...2027.
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope it works out for you. Do you know what really feels like a kick in the nuts, though? [The fact that the same bill creates a tax break for owners and leasers of private jets!](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/360785-senate-tax-bill-includes-tax-break-for-private-jets) If nothing else drives home where Republican priorities are, this should.
As far as I know PhD student positions come with salary(or stipend, call it what you want) in Germany. They are funded from research grants of your professor, so all position advertisements come with a description of a topic you will have to work on. At least in STEM disciplines. The payment is small though, I heard from some folks it is around 800-1000 eur.   EDIT apparently people reporting 2000 eur phd salary, so it's better. The numbers I heard were coming from biology students.
America isn't anti-science, we're anti-education. We fuck all students equally.
Starve the beast and so it will die. 
Probably. Then get former businessmen to teach, since running a business prepares you for literally anything.
How would charter and private schools benefit from a dwindling pool of new teachers?
Uneducated people are easier to control. 
I can't answer that question :(  There appears to be no long-term plan at all.
Uh oh I feel a rant coming on. Nooooo!  Wow that sounds great. Both of my parents are teachers in the same district and things are much different. Starting pay is abysmal and there is a massive shortage of teachers so I actually have a good number of friends (~25 years old) with full time teaching positions that don't have teaching degrees, teaching credentials, or even relevant degrees. One friend just got hired as a junior high biology teacher with zero credentials, no experience, and an architecture degree.  My mother has been teaching for 30 years, won awards for her curriculums, but never got her master's because of money issues (my dad did though.) My ex-girlfriend and my sister were both making $10K more than my mom's highest ever salary only 2-3 years out of college, and my ex works for the government too. They throw money at her because she got her master's, but her job is insanely boring and I could be in her same position with my graphic design bachelors if I'd have gone for it right after graduation.  Both parents moved their retirement up because things are so bad in the district. No money, no support, no respect. Our legislators gave them a COLA for the first time in 15 years and then cut it in half the next year, also destroyed their insurance (basically the only thing that makes teaching worth it.)   This is their last year and my mom moved to a non-teaching position because it's not worth the crushing stress anymore. Really too bad we don't live in an area where teachers are compensated fairly and allowed to flourish and really teach their students. Not sure if there is freedom to truly teach anywhere anymore though. There are tight curriculums now and standardized testing for everything. My mother's amazing award winning salmon spawning curriculum is not used anymore.
That already is a crisis and the bill is not responsible. The same problem exists in the UK. A student told me recently that the dropout rate is 80% within the first few years. Positions are going unfilled entirely because nobody applies.  Truth is, teachers have gone from society's respected elders to society's doormat. People don't want to do the job, even those who have specifically been training to do so. They find out what the reality of the job is like and realise, correctly, that the punishment is not worth the compensation.  Teacher shortage is not a crisis, it's a catastrophe, and it's offensive to the country and the employees. I can think of little greater long term sacrifice than crippling education. But it's an easy pocket for governments to pick and difficult to assess results either way. You can squeeze the budget and replace it with a new plan of action every 6 months and nobody knows what's what. Tell the public there's no problem, job done.
I'm about to finish student teaching, and I get a whopping 5 days of substituting for the whole semester! WHooo! I think the way people become teachers is ridiculous, so the training programs are partially  to blame, but the system teacher candidates go through is a reflection of what society expects from teachers. No one wants their baby to be taught by someone unqualified, and no school system has the money to pay for internships for teacher-candidates.
Giant administrator salaries, shiny new buildings (when the old ones are fine), giant sports complexes, advertising, etc.  It's what happens when public funding and government-guaranteed loans are given to institutions who are mostly privately managed and have everything contracted out to private companies.
My sister is a teacher. It's pretty common for her and her coworkers to offer extra credit for things like kleenexes. 
My argument isn’t that the schools are underwater right now. It’s that they’ve taken on debt obligations that are based on assumptions about admissions & endowments. GOP tax plan targets both assumptions, which could cause long-simmering debt problems to boil over.   Harvard & Yale will be fine. But lots of state schools have followed the same playbook, and are much more exposed to declining enrollment and state bonds. 
Similar to what happened when the housing bubble popped.  A whole host of assets will fall radically in value, since student loans are chopped up and sold like any other debt, a very large group of people will be holding onto assets that are suddenly worth significantly less.  Navient and Sallie Mae will go under and anyone who owns a stake in them will see that money disappear.    Whether or not we see an economy wide recession like we saw with housing is dependent on how wide it spreads.  The dot com bubble burst without a giant long term recession.  Something to bear in mind is that it's unlikely to burst in rapid succession like housing did though.  These debts won't devalue in large chunks at a time, it's more of a slow rot that bursts once the scale hits a certain point.
Weird, we have a teacher shortage and I still make shit. :p
Precisely what happened to Engineers in India
It doesn't take an economist to compare productivity figures to wages and see that productivity is up 170% from 45 years ago while inflation adjusted income is up 15%. People make more stuff for cheaper and get paid the same, and all that surplus capital goes somewhere that is not their pockets.
Same boat different river. I make way more than my friends who did not go to college, but they have a new car and I have a student loan payment. 
That's actually a good point.  I've seen these type of comments everywhere. Just because trades can pay decently with less debt doesn't mean they're for everyone, just like college isn't for everyone. I would hate working in a trade, and it could really break down your body over time.
"> view it as some kind of political tool now.  This only makes sense because there is a clear trend of people being more liberal as they encounter more people from different backgrounds (often at college) and becoming more educated.  I came from a part of the country that is pretty solidly red, and while I was apathetic about politics while I was there, I mostly identified with more conservative values. That changed when I went to college, but not because of any ""brainwashing."" I don't recall ever talking about politics in the classroom. I simply met people who were different from me and learned how to think critically, which in my case made me trend more liberal than conservative."
"One of the best things I learned from going to college is how to research a topic.  I've gotten into many arguments on Facebook about recent events and I always bring a few articles or studies to back up my position. Most of them disregard them completely and tell me that they're not true or ""why don't you tell me what *you* think not not some biased article."" and it's amazing how easy it was for them.   I got into an argument about raising minimum wage (his initial argument was that people who wanted a raise in minimum wage have never worked a *real* job before) and I brought up how it has affected Seattle. How prices rose an insignificant amount, but it was offset by the increase of wages. Also how wages have stagnated compared to productivity the past 40 years. Despite all the data, I was written off and I was told that I didn't understand how economics worked. I'd like to think I know a little about economics, I won't claim to know everything, but I've taken a few courses on macro and micro.   So I just deleted him and said fuck it because it wasn't worth being talked down to by the guy who got chaptered out of the army after basic training and works part time as a call-in at the post office. "
What's funny is that I'm not sure philosophy is even a good example of a useless degree. I've got a philosophy minor for shits and giggles, but the philosophy majors do very well getting into law school,  since there's compositional logic, ethics (haha), and reasoning involved in their degree. At my school, the phil department boasts about having the highest LSAT scores.
Yeah but rich people don't have to pay taxes on their estates so it's worth it
So as a student you can now be taxed on something you don't even earn, whereas the very wealthy aren't even taxed on income they *do* earn (I.E carried interest loophole)  insanity.
Most of the Americans who applied to be PR during their PhD in my program were denied.

I'm not sure about U of M, because it's a public university. But I've heard some talk about private universities just setting a rate of $0 for their fully-funded PhD programs and then giving their normal stipend.  State laws might not allow for difference in tuition rates in some states, so I'm not sure how feasible this is for the public system. 
Sincerely, I am so sorry. Just reading that made me anxious.  Been through something similar, and it made me feel completely and utterly awful. Like, shameful. I'm financially literate enough that people come to me with questions! That was a slap in the face. 
Not for nothin', but you're referencing a tax break introduced by Sherrod Brown, Democrat from Ohio. It even says so in the article you linked. 
800-1000€ is pretty much enough to live a good student life here in Germany. Many of us have a little bit less per month by working minimum wage part time. I'd say 800-1000€ is enough for most cities, maybe except major cities which are far more expensive to live in. I'm a German Computer Science student myself.
Then spend more than they would have after their model fails.
This is Conservative tax policy at work.

It won't be a pop, it will be a dragged out stagnation as people can't walk away from their student debt.
Same thing with entry level pilots. It’s not that there’s a shortage of pilots, there’s a shortage of pilots willing to work crap shifts for crap pay for the first few years. 
There's a large subset of the population that would dismiss that last sentence as simple laziness. 
The irony is that these tuition waivers are super common in engineering fields which are probably one of the best choices for a grad program that leads to a job.  The most ridiculous thing is that they are not taxing money you earn, they are taxing money that the university decided not to charge you. Depending on the value of other stipends you could actually end up owing more money than you were paid in a given year.
Of course, I mean it will trickle down to grad students and magically all grad students will suddenly earn more money. That's how the tax plan works, right?
In a similar vein, teachers can no longer deduct supplies they purchase for their classrooms, but businesses can deduct capital expenses.
people oversimplify it, Surprisingly few actually get in. I have looked heavily in to this and it is MUCH more expensive than people let on, and approval for the programs alone can take years.
Somewhere along the way that generation that inherited vast some of money began to think that only money makes more money. There was zero awareness or appreciation for people that do things. Creators. Inventors. Researchers. Designers.  And now with each successive money making money generation, they feel threatened by those that can do.   Eventually it will slowly dawn on the money babies that there are no more consumers left. No one is buying their shitty condo at inflated prices.   Which is all the money babies seem to do as a career. Invest in shitty condos. 
This is why I dont care of youre Democrat or Republican in government, you just need to make decisions that benefit the majority in the US, not the 1%.
> My field, Middle Eastern studies, doesn't have much of a presence  To be fair, your field being not very well represented in Germany doesn't equate to the post grad system in Germany being abysmal. There are many specialised fields that are essentially confined to a handfull of universities world-wide.
its not about the government spending less, its about the people who are wealthy enough to influence government making more profit. As long as THEY see an improvement in their lives, it doesnt matter whether it works for everyone else.
It's too bad conservative tax policy is raising the deficit and crushing middle class hopes of higher education.
you mean $4000. even that is pocket change to the oligarchs. they can spend $400 on a meal for one. daily.
Teachers in America don’t make 3x that. Most teachers k-12 stay at under 40k/yr until they’ve broken 10+ years of experience. And depending on the district they may never top 90k ever even with 30+ years.  No one teaches for money.
Why would someone teach kids and deal with all the bureaucratic stuff that comes with a teaching environment for 13 bucks? I'd rather work retail tbh. At least I don't have to bring work at home, and I can be promoted to management. Oh, and I can leave the job anytime I want.
"This. The education corporations are vile entities that are destroying education more than politicians. They create problems, ""Look at these test scores! They are horrible! Our entire education system is failing!"" But of course, *they* have the solution. ""Just subscribe to XYZ textbook services! Only $400 a student! It will surely help with those test scores.""  Only, the tests are created by *those same companies!* So essentially, we are testing students on knowledge, crafted by education corporations, to test how well our students are doing, all so those same corporations can sell our schools their own textbooks and materials that teach to those same freaking tests! It's beyond stupid and parents and politicians eat it up hook, line, and sinker.  That's not saying our education system is perfect. There are a ton of problems. But these education corporations are *not* our friends and they certainly don't hold the solutions to those problems."

Yep, but it's still willful ignorance.  I'm a tradesman:  Nobody wants to be doing field work when they're 60 because we all realize that you're  pretty well physically used up by age 50.  Unwillingness to sacrifice your health for a paycheck does not indicate laziness, especially when as a nation we just sorta kick the sickly to the curb.
That's what I don't get, the populations that are more heavily taxed in this proposal are usually the higher percentage spenders of their income. Taxing them more immediately inhibits the economy and the flow of money.    The overly affluent usually don't spend frivolously and aren't gonna take their new untaxed percentage and spurn the economy forward.
True. And then only their children are rich enough to afford the expensive private school. Which only have to money to hire the rare remaining teachers. Keeping knowledge, money and even privilege in the family. Mission accomplished.
That's what makes it intense and unpredictable  - where will he spend his one meal? Is it 9 course or only 5?
Exactly. Teaching in the U.S. used to be a good job; respected and paid fairly well. Now in some places, they are struggling to stay afloat financially and working for years for the same low salary. It's a serious shame.
teacher salaries are public. I looked up my favorite teacher, 20 years experience and he even switched grade levels to make more money.  my starting salary out of college (CompSci) was higher than his salary.
In my experience, most teachers won't top 50-60k, let alone 90k. My mom's just about ready to retire, after working in the same district for 30+ years, and she's only making 52k a year.
"Honestly, this is why I have always felt that people need more education on property tax and state taxes rather than more federal taxes. I say that, because when I pay my property tax and state tax, I get an itemized breakdown of where every penny went. States administer their education and healthcare programs to include budgeting. When the federal government takes their large cut of your income they purposely make it difficult to track where specifically the money goes.   When I pay said property tax, I see that most of it goes to the school system, county hospital system, and to a lesser extent police, fire, and county road maintenance. Literally broken down by every penny. State tax is the same way, but a large sum goes to servicing state bonds/debt plus the guard in contrast to my property tax.   Having always lived in relatively conservative communities, there is rarely much issue with property taxes - once again, there's accountability. Plus, we know that much of our money goes into schools and such and people are all about that. People do get iffy about sales tax hikes - perhaps because much of that goes to the state and of course it has a much broader reaching impact.   When Uncle Sam takes so much of your income concurrently with all the politics involved in ""national debt"" and such, it is easy to see why rural and conservative voters in general are less than enthused. Are they wrong? No. But it helps if we start to understand other point of views rather than writing them off because we don't live the way they do. "
That is so sad that our schools don't even have enough tissues in the classroom and teachers have to ask students to bring them in. This is incredibly embarrassing for our country.
Yeah, well, by now, we should know that logic is not a driving mechanism behind their actions. 
Give tax breaks to the poor and they spend it at the grocery store, or on services like furnace replacements, haircuts, movie dates. Give tax breaks to the rich and you get billionaires who have more money than they can spend in a lifetime. 
Like modern-day slavery. Keep the laborers uneducated so that they stay poor, and the rich can continue to exploit them because they don't know how to do anything else except manual labor. And the more there are, the less they have to pay them because of supply and demand economics.
Not to mention most, if not all of these teachers buy supplies out of their own pocket because public education funding is a joke. 
Our schools; crippled with low funding, lunches lobbied by food conglomerates, and weighing the pros and cons of teaching the controversies of evolution and birth control. Is there any saving us?
And this tax plan even does away with the small deduction teachers can use for buying their own supplies...
It's embarrassing as a country.
Jesus Christ, I forgot about the food issues. Evolution and reproductive health/birth control as a controversy are breaking my heart. We take 1 step forward and 2 steps back as a country when it comes to education. We should be embarrassed. 
If we learned anything from the anti-vaccination movement it's that scientific evidence against an already cemented opinion will do nothing to sway that opinion. At best it will be ignored, at worst it will be twisted out of context and used to support their position.

Entertainment Computing, 2018; 24: 21   DOI: 10.1016/j.entcom.2017.10.003  Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952117300113?via%3Dihub  Highlights  • Two large scale online game experiments (total n = 2778).  • Behavioural realism does not increase the activation of aggressive concepts in VVGs.  • Challenges theories which assert that more VVG realism leads to greater VVG effects.  Abstract  > A common argument in the violent video game (VVG) literature is that the greater the realism of a game, the more it activates aggressive concepts, and the greater antisocial effects it will have on its players.  > Several experiments have therefore looked into whether the graphical realism of VVGs might influence their effects. These experiments have returned mixed results. However, there are other ways that a VVG can be realistic besides looking like the real world. More specifically, things in VVGs can not only look realistic, they can also behave realistically. It may be the case that this kind of realism leads to increases in the activation of aggressive concepts, rather than increases in graphical realism.  > In this paper, we therefore present two large-scale online experiments (n = 898 and n = 1880) which investigate the effects of two different manipulations of behavioural realism on the activation of aggressive concepts in VVGs. In neither experiment did increasing realism increase the activation of aggressive concepts.  > Realism is often described as increasing the effects of VVGs. These results contradict this perspective, and instead suggest that realism may not lead to increases in aggression-related variables.
Unlike in the case of the anti-vaccine movement, the research on the relationship between violence and video game play is a lot more conflicted. For example, [this APA paper](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/technical-violent-games.pdf) found a link between video game play and aggression (but not criminal delinquency), and [this longitudinal study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026046) found a long-term link between competitive video game play and aggression. Those kinds of papers don't get talked about much on sites like reddit, so it's easy to get the impression that there's no data out there against your opinion. (That said, even if there *is* a link between violence and video games, which I'm not convinced exists, the relationship is pretty weak.)
You can find details on the various studies that have been done [here](http://www.apa.org/pi/families/review-video-games.pdf).
More competitive players are going to be drawn to video games anyway...  To truly test this, you would need to do a very lengthy study, to see whether people who haven't already been playing video games change or not after a long period, which costs a lot money.  And is it really worth investing all that just to see that you have a +15% chance of not being in a stable relationship if you play 4 hours everyday ? I mean each person does whatever he wants, is the bottom line.
"A couple key things:  - The outcome measure for aggression was not observed aggressive behavior but rather the Anderson word fragment completion task  - This experiment explored the specific impact of a specific type of in-game realism and its relation to activation of aggressive concepts. It isn't quite exploring a broad link between video game violence and actual violence or aggressive behavior  -It's a bit disengenuous to say that this study determines that there is ""no evidence to support link between violent video games and behavior."" They included no measure of behavior at all. It's not a meta-analysis of previous evidence.   This is a GREAT experiment with good methodology and controls. But it's generalizability has limits   "
There was a Horizon special on one of the BBC  Channels about video games and violence. iirc it came to the conclusion that *violent* video games can desensitize you to violence, but don't really make you more aggressive. They also said that video games do more good than bad, using the example of video games being used to help treat Alzheimer's patients, and video games being used to help train surgeons.  I'll see if I can find a source for it.  Edit: Link to it on BBC Two Website, the main video is unavailable, but there should still be some clips - http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06cjypk  ~~Link to the video on Dailymotion, but it's sped up by quite a bit, but I'll post it anyway - http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x38qzq8~~  ~~Link to the video on ihavenotv, it's got ads though - https://ihavenotv.com/are-video-games-really-that-bad-horizon~~  Edit Edit: According to u/TwoDevTheHero, this Dailymotion video is a better version than the ihavenotv one and the first Dailymotion one -  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x377csv
I remember doing my own paper in school related to links between video games and violence, and one paper really stood out to me (I can't seem to find the link to it at the moment, but once I get home I can check my sources again in my paper...if I can find that too).  Basically, the paper did notice a link between video games and aggression. *However*, they noticed that the aggression is very similar to the aggression one gets from playing sports, or anything competitive really. This is most noticeable in multiplayer games as the competitive environment creates this, but can happen in single player games as well (like trying to beat a level). So in the end, the paper concluded that while it does increase aggression, *it does not necessarily mean it makes a person more violent as a whole. Rather, it's more closely linked to sports players or fans who become more aggressive in a competitive environment due to the nature of wanting to win.*  I haven't had the chance to read the papers you linked though because, again, I'm not home atm, but if it makes those same points as well, I apologize for re-iterating, but I just wanted to share what a paper I read for my own reports has found that I agreed with the most.
No, actually. The results have *not* been consistent. It's only the results that get posted to reddit that are consistent.  See [here](http://www.apa.org/pi/families/review-video-games.pdf) for a report on how different studies have different results.
Interesting.  I literally only read the bolded statements in the conclusion, but it sounds like they're saying that the literature links video games to increased aggression and decreased social abilities, but does not link to violence?
Competitive games*  Many games aren't competitive and I know many that have zero desire to even play multiplayer casually.
"That being said, the word fragmentation completion task has about 30 years of history now in testing state aggression (how aggressive you are at that moment), which places it pretty securely into the ""accepted methodology"" status. (Bassili & Smith, 1986 is the earliest reference I'm aware of). It's been pretty consistently confirmed over that time frame as a useful measure. It's been used to study state aggression in a number of other scenarios as well (following theft, listening to violent music, etc).  TL;DR - While they do not have a measure of *enacted* behavior, they do have a measure of *state aggression* which has been shown to predict behavior. The Anderson word fragment completion test was developed in 1999, but the same methodology has existed in some form since ~1986. It's a pretty solid study honestly.  EDIT: This measures **state** aggression, which is to say, how aggressive you are at the moment. I'm not aware of any study linking fragment completion to **trait** aggression, which is how aggressive you are in general."
I’ve actually written an essay and used that report as a source. The increased aggression only lasted a short amount of time after playing the video games, and was not a significant increase.  The decreased social abilities is only a large effect if a person is addicted to video games, and therefore isolates themselves from social activities. 
"Completely agree! The measure is valid and reliable for measuring state aggression, but the extension of state aggression to aggressive behavior, or even trait aggression, is not well-studied. Like I said, the study itself very successfully does what it sets out to do and has solid methodology, but the ""headline title"" is misrepresentative of what researchers themselves were studying. "
Does  watching tv and it's endless news cycle of war, lies, murder also desensitize us to those behaviors? 
*According to a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems by researchers at The University of Notre Dame, some 73 percent of posts on Reddit are voted on by users that haven’t actually clicked through to view the content being rated.*  Hopefully this information allows 3 out of 4 people to not have to read through the article.
This reminds me of the “conveyer belt” theory of reddit. That content that is instantly recognizable as either something someone agrees with on its face via a headline or title or a repost someone has already seen are the most upvoted content on reddit. Content that requires more careful consideration or to be read is stuff that never really gets traction on reddit. I think it’s sort of daft to think reddit is somehow above people who are headline parrots. 
I actually wrote an opinion article about this. People will vote on, like things, without getting invested into it and it leads to a culture of armchair activism. In other words, more talk less action.
Redditor demonstrated that even without a click-through, redditors may get the details of an article from quotes in thread or even a TL;DR summary.  Which they didn't control for as demonstrated in the article. Study on redditors not reading didn't actually read Reddit threads.
And the introduction from the IEEE paper itself:  >We frequently rely on online ratings contributed by anonymous users as an important source of information to make decisions about which products to buy, movies to watch, news to read, or even political candidates to support. These online ratings are gradually replacing traditional word-of-mouth communication about an object or idea’s quality. The sheer volume of new information being produced and consumed only increases the reliance that individuals place on the ability of anonymous others to curate and sort massive amounts of information. Because of the economic and intrinsic value involved, it is important to understand how individuals consume anonymously curated information and contribute to the wisdom of the crowd.
I much prefer reading about the discussion about the content rather than the content itself. Eventually the discussion creates the context given by the article anyways, whether through summaries or the different comments. 
It probably results in their woefully high number of non-readers being *lower* than the population as a whole.  Their sample consisted of people who browse the (non-default?) subreddits they advertised in, **clicked on the post to view either the link or comments**, and cared enough about the topic to participate in the study. *That* self-selected group doesn't read articles 73% of the time. The percent of regular users who vote on headlines alone would almost certainly be even higher than that.
It's likely that there are even more headline browsers than the study suggests.
Often, especially if there is a paywall, someone will post most if not all of the article text.
Don’t forget that not all content needs analyzed.  Much of Reddit is about entertainment.
I went straight to the comments section like I always do and now I've gotten the gist. (I almost rarely vote though). But usually I can get the tldr or atleast view an argument from multiple comments and get both sides of the point pretty well. Something I've heard before was that if you want the answer to something, post an incorrect answer and 9/10 times someone will correct you,  and probably link sources just to prove you wrong. 
"I was thinking this same thing. Though with that said that still isn't as good as actually reading the article, has a lot of potential for humdiggery from pesky rapscallions spreading misinformation.  I've seen it countless times as I mod /r/worldnews, it's not uncommon at all for the top voted up comment to be talking about something that isn't in the article at all, or the exact opposite merely based on context of the title. Thats made worse by the fact that (Obviously) a writer isn't above making absolute claims (""X said This is going to happen soon!"") when the truth is more speculation  or potential situation (""X said Y could potentially lead to Z"")  for the sake of a catchy headline or title. "
But that opens up a lot of room for anonymous posters to control the discussion away from the actual source (astroturfing). One of the biggest problems with online discourse at this time.
Also, there will very often be a comment near the top either discrediting the article or separating the kernel of truth from the hyperbole. It's very nearly always more informative to check the comments first, unless you're one of the first people to find the submission (no comments yet) or the comments make you want to read the article for yourself. Most of the time though, that's just not necessary.
"the top comments that ""discredit"" an article (thank god reddit is here to peer review already published articles) are often written by people who obviously didn't read it either. they polish their BS by poo-pooing sample sizes and making assumptions about selection biases and whatever else without understanding the research methods in the respective field, and they clearly aren't bothering to read what the authors write in the requisite Discussion section about the limitations of their study. they also don't seem to understand what makes something statistically significant. this is especially true when a study finds something that offends reddit's sensibilities, e.g. some papers in the social sciences. it's important to be skeptical, but people talking fancifully out of their ass get upvoted heavily."
"> the top comments that ""discredit"" an article (thank god reddit is here to peer review already published articles) are often written by people who obviously didn't read it either  For example, the study tracked *all* reddit activity for selected users, not just their activity in /r/science. In other words, a lot of this was in subreddits where ""published articles"" is an exceptionally weak standard - essentially ""content published on a website that isn't reddit.""  I'll also note from a long history on reddit that very often the ""debunking"" comments are from people who are experts in the field and often obviously smarter than the author of the original article. Also, they are frequently couched as interrogatories, not assertions. (i.e. ""Why didn't the author mention [x]?"")"
"""Better click through to a high res version of this low effort meme so I can make a careful analysis of whether to upvote..."""
"Also really cool from the article:  ""The cattle industry commonly sprays pesticides to combat biting flies, but the researchers say that painting stripes with non-toxic materials could be cheaper, healthier for livestock, and better for the  environment."""
This is great but sadly just a 6 cow study. They still need to test on bigger samples and also see if the insects eventually learn how to handle stripes.
Could that have anything to do with the paint covering 50% of their skin?
Would painting the cow with stripes affect their well being, especially the way they relate and communicate with each other?
"huh. i thought this was common knowledge. there is a wide range of ""anti-fly"" blankets in germany you can buy for horses: [https://www.fedimax.de/zebra-fliegendecke/a-1174/](https://www.fedimax.de/zebra-fliegendecke/a-1174/)  edit: for all non-germans. the product pages links to a source [http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/iii](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/iii) and also references swedish and hungarian studies which are unfortunately not linked.  edit2: found it [https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/215/5/736.full.pdf](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/215/5/736.full.pdf)"
Ok, so when the human testing starts?
Couldn't it also be that whatever they used for the stripes actually repelled the bugs?
"Wouldn't it be more accurate to say ""One of the functions of a Zebra's stripes?"" Since another function is that it works as razzle dazzle camoflage in herds to confuse predators into where one animal begins and ends as well as confusing depth perception."
I was curious to see if the ~~mosquitoes~~ insects tended to bite one color more than the other, but the article didn't mention that.
You really think the cattle industry is going to take the time to paint stripes on all of their cattle rather than do a sweeping spray of pesticides? Unfortunately less time is more $$.  (Edit: I know it can be done with mass production style machines just not anytime soon.)
I wonder how effective the pesticides are. If stripes reduce by 50%, and pesticide reduces by 98%. Then this result isn't as promising as it initially appeared.  Sorry to be the wet blanket but I just don't see painted cows in our future.
Also, not mentioned in the article, do the chemicals in the paint deter flies or is it the pattern?  Edit: As many have pointed out, a group of cattle were painted a single color and had a similar fly ratio to that of the unpainted cattle. I did not flex my deductive reasoning muscles enough when reading the article!
>and also see if the insects eventually learn how to handle stripes.  Stripes have been pretty successful for zebras for quite a while.  Why would cattle be any different?
They painted black cows with the same material and insects didnt reduce there
Control cows were painted, just not with stripes.
I think the answer to your question is likely yes it would cause distress.   [Temple Grandin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Grandin) has looked into this type of thing. She's a fascinating person. Definitely worth checking out if you want to understand simple things that can cause distress (to cattle). Youtube has tons of videos of her lectures and there is a movie about her.
A big portion of science is putting hard numbers to speculation and intuition that has been around for thousands of years. Just knowing something works isn't enough. The magnitude and mechanics of it's efficacy is also important, which isn't covered by ancestral knowledge
There has already been at least one study. Some tribes in Africa, Australia, and Papua New Guinea paint light colored stripes on their dark skin to similar effect.  https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181325
Yes. While the study tried to control for this by testing black cows with black stripes (which produced no reduction in biting) they did not test the effects of painting a cow all white. This seems strange as it is an obvious control. There could be a non obvious reason for not including them but they don't discuss the possibility at all.
"Many biting insects ( including mosquitoes), use heat to find their hosts. So the stripes heating differently in the sun could confuse the parasite  edit: the study is mainly for tabanid blood-feeding flies, which prioritize visual cues. The cows were black naturally and painted with either white stripes or brown stripes. The white worked much better than the brown, which almost didn't work at all. So, while my initial thought may be still be somewhat true (the white stripes are cooler and tabanids do also use heat to find hosts), the primary effect is most likely visual!  Exploring [one of their references](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938413001996?via%3Dihub) was explanatory where striped sphere blood-feeding fly lures outperformed all white lures  (25 vs 52), and both greatly outperforming all black (622). This means that all-white protects about as much as stripes... we can't know if it's all down to visual cues, temperature, or most likely a combination of both. Interestingly, they go on to discuss: ""ungulates can avoid \[host-seeking flies\] by moving into shade, or by tail swishing, grazing during cool times of the day, or using a mixed strategy of grazing in the sun and periodically retreating into shade [\[18\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938413001996?via%3Dihub#bb0090), [\[24\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938413001996?via%3Dihub#bb0120)."""
Article doesn't mention mosquitoes specifically and I don't know if mosquitoes even use sight to move about.
Depends on delivery, I could imagine a low tech, cattle blanket template type deployment system with an overhead spray that could probably get the cost down, especially if instead of paint they used some kind of dust like material.  Pesticides aren’t totally trivial to deploy either and the cost of the material is likely far higher so this could be feasible
That would depend on other factors too.   50% reduction at $1 a cow might be better than 98% reduction at $10 a cow, especially if it has side benefits (reducing harmful chemical use, ease of use, etc.)  It depends on more factors than simple efficacy.
First thing I thought of too. They should examine the effects of different paints for a better idea
It's the pattern. There are earlier papers on this. Stripes beat flat color coats. In fact they even know the minimum and optimal width of the stripes (in the case of the flies that target Zebra).   And it's not just the pattern of brightness- it's that black and white bits of the zebra coat polarize light differently and this disrupts the fly vision somehow.
Not sure about the extent of this difference in practice, but for one their population is vaaaaastly larger than the zebra population, and spread over a much larger and varied area, so there's a much larger and varied set for the random process of evolution to work with. So intuitively or from a statistical perspective we'd expect some success to happen sooner with cattle.
Mosquitos track CO2 from exhalation, don't they?  I'd previously read that the stripe pattern makes it difficult for the insect to make its final approach, because the stripes make the animal blend in with the tall grass.  Also, it seems tribal communities already knew this.  https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.181325
Wow. Good info. Is there any benefit to striped clothing or is it just skin?
"""Why Do Mosquitoes Bite Some People More Than Others?  Blood type, metabolism, exercise, shirt color and even drinking beer can make individuals especially delicious to mosquitoes""   https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-mosquitoes-bite-some-people-more-than-others-10255934/"
They already go through a cattle run for vaccinations and tagging etc. It wouldn't be hard to just spray them as they are held for the procedure.
Cows already do this. When we milk cows, all of them file into the milking parlor and wait their turn. This would be a great place add the paint system. If would be off for most of the year. Only need to use it mid June through early September.   We also have robotic milking systems where the cows also take turns getting milked. We could easily install this there too. The system tracks each cow so the system could also track which cow was painted when.   Cows don’t mind rain, they get wet. Any colorant would need to be water resistant.
"I think this is what the ""black stripes only"" group was about.  It had only slightly lower bites."
I don't think you understand?    They painted black cows with the same paint to see if it was really just the chemical repelling them away and not the stripes. Except it didn't work, the flies came back, which implies it really is the visual stripes that's shooing them off.
> Mosquitos track CO2 from exhalation, don't they?  They do for initial tracking, but that doesn't help them find a location to bite once they find a host.  I'm not sure what they use to locate a suitable shallow blood vessel.
All they have to do is stab, they are pretty much guaranteed to sever blood vessels/capillaries when they insert their proboscis.
Ummm ok where do I start with this....  If the reduced temperature is the cause of the stripes confusing insects, then the theory it evolved to protect zebras is functionally identical to if it was the color pattern of the stripes confusing the insects.  Because the actual zebras?  They have white stripes that reflect at lower temperatures too.
Just wiggle that proboscis and you’ll find something https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/alalmg/mosquito_finding_a_blood_vessel/
Then you'll have a bunch of cows looking like old timey cartoon bank robbers
You say this like it's a bad thing
Well, elephants can bend and control their dicks. Nature be like that sometimes.
I really expected you to say trunks, especially with the whole proboscis connection, but nope. Dicks.
>A 2016 study of 22 countries found that parents with children at home were actually [slightly happier than their child-free peers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222535/) if they lived in places like Norway, Portugal and Sweden that have paid parental leave, generous childcare subsidies and holiday and sick leave.  I think this last point can't be ~~understated~~ overstated. Parents don't need to be stressed and miserable if appropriate support structures are in place.  Edit: oops, I meant the other word.
I wonder how the parents feel if the kids never move out though..
This also means the couple would have to sustain a somewhat happy marriage with the kids and not get divorced in order to reap the benefits later in life.
I wonder what the happiness value of an adult, working child who still lives at home is.
I wonder if they controlled for the presence of grandchildren. Grandchildren do seem to provide a great deal of happiness, I envy my friends who have them. I seems hardwired too: I never cared about babies and toddlers until I reached grandparent age, and now they are as compelling as puppies.
I would like to see a study that compares happy healthy marriages of couples that planned their child compared to those that aren’t.
That’s an 18+ year investment that I’m not sure the ROI makes up for.
Yes this, if you have “enough” money in the USA, and by enough I mean a lot, the stresses of having and maintaining your life with children are lessened. You basically need enough money to afford day care, a night nanny for the first few months of life, enough to easily cover health care for everyone, a big enough car, and have money left over to travel and vacation. That’s a ton of money and most people don’t like to admit that you really do need a lot of money to stay sane with kids in the USA at least.
Not just the structure but the culture as well. Parenting in America has become an obsessive, 24/7, child centered affair, often removing any shot at social interaction without children being there or involved. This is not sustainable for sane, stable adults and relationships.
Yeah, here in Canada a parent gets 12-18months and the father gets 7 weeks use it or lose it. It makes having a child so much easier. Being home with my wife for those first few months was so incredibly nice. Our son is 14 months and so far it’s pretty fun. I think the key to not being miserable as a parent is to get all the partying out of your system in your 20’s until you’re sick of it. At 32 nothing beats waking up at 6am on a Saturday and walking with my child to get a coffee. However I have only lived with a 0-14 month old. Maybe the next 18 years are hell. We will see.   Edit: the 12-18 months is for either parent and there are some other details...but it’s something along those lines.
And then, there's opposite where their kids want to move out and parent don't let them do it.
Depends on culture I guess. As a first generation Asian American my parents want me to stay with them, both financially and since they don't really speak English. however, I wouldn't want my kids to stay with me.
Exactly. Unfortunately, many people don't realize that marriage can be a tremendous struggle. Especially with children!  My wife and I enjoy the analogy that marriage means that we are permanently shackled together, regardless of how crazy our children make us. Anything worthwhile is worth fighting for.
Why exactly does it mean that? I'll still get joy out of my adult children even though I am not still married to their father.
Depends I think. When this was my situation, my parents genuinely did not want me to leave.   Retired people are often very lonely. They don’t have any friends and rarely see people whom they care about...so they may actually value their kids and other family members living at home.  Also worth noting that in many cultures around the world (Japan is an example I believe), it is very normal for adult kids to live with their parents.
Right? If you read the full study the data actually doesn’t point to any actual percentage of people with kids happier than those without, only empty nesters happen than those with kids living at home. It actually has a graph that shows those with zero children are the same level of happiness as the happiest empty nester (39%).   Not to mention this study is a very small sample size of a narrow age range that doesn’t even look at happiness of parents while the children are younger, it seems to only hypothesize that they were unhappy in early age ranges? Or is stating this from a previous study it doesn’t cite?  A much more interesting and well done study over the period of a few decades actually does back up parts of this study but are missing huge chunks of data. It analyzed people from the ages of teenage to 70’s+ and found that those who had kids did indeed have higher “highs” of happiness than those without, but also lower lows than those without, the only age that is guaranteed more happiness is at the same age everyone’s happiness already start going up, after age 70,  they attributed that to grandchildren, which does slightly correlate to this study. But it was a very slight amount, and in the end childless adults will still be more stably happy across their lifespan, just with fewer high peaks.  Also fun fact from that study, men who are married will have higher reports of happiness across their entire lifespan regardless of who they marry. (Versus unmarried men, single or no). Women on the other hand can actually end up MORE unhappy than single women if they have an unhappy marriage. (Still reap the benefits from a happy marriage though in their happiness index)
Let alone confusing correlation with causation with that word “make”.
We've got a 4 month old and older people (50+) FLOCK to her wherever we go (and especially at work).  You might be on to something.
Agreed.   People who are constipated are way happier after a healthy poop than people who have regular bowel movements. I'd rather not be constipated though.
>Yes this, if you have “enough” money in the USA, and by enough I mean a lot, the stresses of having and maintaining your life with children are lessened.

That’s a ton of money and most people don’t like to admit that you really do need a lot of money to stay sane with kids in the USA at least.  As a Scandinavian I believe you’ve got this wrong. You need enough money, but not so you can pay other people to raise your children. Rather, it’s about you and your partner being able to take time off to focus on raising your children.  Putting kids in daycare and having a night nanny look after them after-hours is, from my cultural perspective, not the solution if you want a positive and healthy relationship with well adjusted and happy children. What Denmark, Sweden, Norway do well is they empower parents to be exactly that; parents to their children. Long parental leaves, (relatively) generous holidays, working hours that end at 4pm etc. makes for happy children and happy parents.
I’m laying next to my 3mo right now while my wife is down stairs with our 3yo. We love them more than anything in the world. There are definitely stressors though. We’re sleep training our youngest because we didn’t sleep for a year with our oldest. We both teach, so we’ll be paying for daycare very soon. Who knew that we have an extra $1600 a month just lying around?  When I read child care subsidies up above, I shed a wishful tear. How in a country like the United States do we not have those?! Everyone agrees that we need to take care of our children and early intervention is key to later success, but helping pay for Daycare is just a no no, I guess.  Edit: I didn’t mean for this comment to be taken as “America sucks.” I love this damn country and it’s done a lot of good in the world. Hell it still is, but these social programs that just seem common sense to me shouldn’t be a political talking point. It should be a reality. America’s amazing, it should be the world leader in things like this again.
So it's basically; have enough money so someone else can do the annoying chores that come with having children. OR.... Have a social plan that gives you enough free time so you can also do fun things with your children besides the annoying chores that would take up your free time otherwise.  Nah... it's not for me I suppose. The only thing I love more than children is doing anything I want whenever I want. ;-)
My cousin is in graduate school, bright and capable person, her parents can NOT let her grow up, they are moving to near her out of state college and want her to live with them, pay rent to them instead of getting her own place. I think that’s really unhealthy tbh, especially bc most of her school was paid through scholarship so I don’t think she exactly “owes” them anything.
"So it seems like when it comes to parenting, America is becoming Asia.   As someone who grew up there, don't. America can do better than that.   It's toxic, overcontrolling, micromanaging, heartless, mechanical, result-oriented, almost a child abuse. Asian parenting is something suitable for corporate HR management, not for household.   It's also how silent sociopaths are made. They can't learn what's right or wrong from their parents. They learn it from a hypercompetitive free-for-all arena where parental control is missing. Those kids end up becoming ruthless, perverted, broken, antisocial, manipulative, selfish, etc. They don't hesitate to destroy every single potential competitors at all costs.   They are blocked from normal social life for their ages so they flee to perversion like sick porns(such as rape porn, violent hardcore porn or illegal peep cam in the wild), twisted fetish(such as pedophilic obsession to feel dominant), violent hobbies, game addiction or misdemeanors. I witnessed a lot of those. One of my classmates went to juvenile detention center for sexual assault, because he thought he is allowed to ""own"" a girl like porn.  Americans used to pity Asian parenting, saying ""damn, that's merciless and horrible, thank god we don't do that here"". How the turntables... Now Korea is giving up hope on upward mobility therefore people are trying to leave the country instead of playing a domestic competition, and Japan became less competitive thanks to massive Boomer retirement. What an irony. Well, countries like Mainland China, India, Singapore are still survivalist as hell.  EDIT: ""Egomaniac"" is something I should say for those kids from all-praise-no-scolding ""You are so special"" American parenting.   Inappropriately-raised Asians are not really egomaniac, they are just two-faced, insecure, low self-esteem sociopaths."
"I think these studies don't take into account the cultural differences where some families outside the US or other western nations usually live all together under the same roof, or share family life much closely than what would be ""normal"" for others."
What worked for me was telling my parents that I’d never get married if I didn’t get a place of my own. “Girls in America don’t like guys that live at home with their parents.”  They would much rather see me married asap than helping them out at the house. 😂
That’s what my family is like. I live 3hrs away, but if I don’t make it “home” to see my mom every other weekend she’ll throw a fit
Been living at home to save money for grad school, I’m counting down the hours until I move out and my dad is visibly upset every time it comes up.
Our deal was whoever initiates the divorce gets the kids. Neither of us was willing to take that on.   Also, no one ever admits that kids are the worst thing you can do for your relationship - at least early on.   My husband and I did manage it though it wasn’t pretty at times. It’s been close to 25 years now and I agree - kids moving out was the start of our happiest times.
"Yes, it is why they say ""Hold on to love"", because it is a bumpy ride"
In Mexico parents don't really expect you to move out right after college.   Maybe once you get married. But i have never heard of any of my friends being told to get their own place after college.  Its probably very different depending to culture and nationality.
As a spaniard I think the same. More important than money is time itself. Time to be with your kids. Doesn't matter if we are so poor that we cant go on vacation or stuff like that.
What we do in the USA is insane. Often, both parents need to work full time to make ends meet. That means the kid is shuffled off into daycare as soon as they are able (at a year old or less sometimes) which is itself an astronomical cost. The parents are exhausted and anxious by the time they get home and have to do actual parenting in the evening.  Miserable parents. Miserable kids, raised by underpaid and miserable employees.  Yeah we're not about positive and healthy relationships with well adjusted happy people here. We're about squeezing workers like trying to get blood out of a stone.
While I agree with you, the American way of life seems to be “Whatever keeps you in the office”, not “whatever allows you to spend time with your kids/raise well adjusted citizens”. It’s sad, because I’m totally in your camp. I hate a lot of American things.
> How in a country like the United States do we not have those?!   Capitalism run amok. As you may have heard, the rich have been getting richer for over 3 decades while real wages stagnate.
Growing up I remember having to go with my parents to boring dinners with their friends a lot. No toys, no video games, and sometimes no other kids my age. If we were lucky, my brother and I could be excused to play in the backyard.   I also remember when we were on family vacations, we would spend several full days touring boring museums, historical homes, or famous battlefields. We weren't allowed to complain. All we could do was just try to find creative ways to have fun and hope that by day three they would take us to a playground or swimming pool for a few hours.
Either they’re broke or they’re struggling with the fact she’s grown up
I taught esl in Asia in the early aughts. I was dismayed to see how rigidly controlled the kids were. Then I came back to the US and realized that we are becoming like Asia teaching to tests, everything about the university, over scheduled kids. I agree with you it's not good.
"This.   In many cultures children don't move out until they are married. And even if they do get married, it is normal in *some* cultures for both families to live under the same roof.   It's a very western idea for kids to move out immediately after graduating high school/turning 18, and it's western to hold that expectation over the kid. I've knows friends in the USA who literally became homeless as soon as they turned 18 (if they couldn't afford to pay for college) because the parents kicked them out.   I think it's important for a young adult to move out and develop their own social life. Parent's ""not letting"" their adult children move out by using emotional manipulation or other unhealthy/emotionally abusive tactics stunts their emotional development and the child can result in being psychologically fucked up or unable to maintain healthy relationships because of it."
This was my mother-in-law until my wife and I moved and declined to share our new address with her or anyone else in the family who might give it to her.
I’ve seen lots of those kind of posts where people discuss the coming of age “moving out” stuff. Seems like America is the only country where it’s not uncommon for parents to kick you out when your 18 or view it as weird to be living with your parents still.   But we can’t just give the manager at Walmart a strong handshake, work there and get a wife, car, 2 kids and a house and have life be fuckin dandy. Jobs and wages are fucked, this is the new norm for people without rich families that pay there own kids schooling so they can drink all day in a dorm.
Exactly. The park is free. We have too many people that actually spend more time watching TV in a day than they work. Me and my wife sacrificed a lavish house and new cars so she could spend time with our children and they are quite well adjusted and top of their classes because we sacrificed financial wealth and flashy objects for our children.
The latter, they’re pretty well off. They originally sold their second vacation home just to get one closer to her college and now they’re just straight up moving there. She isn’t excited about it :(
It's not even a western thing, it's an American (and maybe north European) thing. In southern Europe kids move out when they marry, and even then they usually live under the same roof. Usually living far away is considered a bad thing and something that happens for necessity.
As someone who lives in the UK, but is of Indian heritage, I u understand both ways.   I wont ever want to be back permanently to my parents house, but at the same time I'm jealous of my brothers and cousins who all have shot loads of money because they dont have or pay bill's and stuff and can afford to by a house.   It does make  a lot of sense to daty at home until a little later, but that level of independence you get moving out is pretty great too.  However, when it comes to parents becoming old, it seems better to have them live with families as opposed to being stuck in an old people's home, which must just suck.
"Exactly.   I'm Vietnamese and first gen in the U.S. in my family. Having not only the usual generational difference, but also the cultural difference can weigh heavily on you, because there are parts of both cultures I like and dislike.   I'm 25, recently graduated, and want to move out. But my parents aren't ""letting"" me. I can already easily see my stunted emotional growth with my peers and I haven't had the best relationships - it's a big reason why I want to move out, but my parents don't see that at all. They tell me that I don't ""act"" 25, but don't want to recognize that they have played a big role in that."
>always interested in parents opinions.  Ok, I'm 70, my partner 65, 2 kids 26 & 31, both kids out of the house, through school, working full time. I/we were saddened when the kids left -- although it was our goal (their independence). We had so much fun -- at really all stages/ages. Not terribly excited about grandkids, should they happen. I'm sure we'll love them, but childcare was like a great memorable meal, and I feel kind of full and ready to do something else.  We scrimped and sacrificed a bit, especially with school expenses, but we were constantly reminding ourselves how lucky we were (and felt). If we had a do-over we wouldn't change a thing really. I realize that maybe we had a better than average experience, lucky in love, lucky with kid's health (& our own), at least a bit lucky with jobs/careers, but at least some of it had to do with our preparations, decisions, and expectations.
ye im from north europe where if you live with your parents at 20 you are complete loser, but now i live in spain and here people live together only separating if necesary for a job or bad relations.
So what do you personally prefer? What are the ups and downs of each model? I think I’d go crazy if I had to live with my family for my whole life.
i was embeded in spanish family, cause my ex was spanish, so i really saw both models intimately.   i would say family forever together model only works if all members of family are into happy flappy lifestyle which most southerners are, because as soon as you introduce burning ambition to be most powerful possible as north people have, all that becomes a nuisance and burden and you want only people you carefully select to be in your life and cut all ties with anyone who even remotly bothers u.
> and in general you have an easier time.  That really depends on the dynamics of your family home. I have to carry the burden of caring for myself in every capacity, yes, but now I don't have to deal with 24/7 drama, lack of privacy, lack of food choices, long ass commute.
Healing without scarring actually seems even more interesting to study. Even some basic studies could reveal the purpose of scarring. Does she regenerate nerves and sweat glands?  Does it take longer to heal?
This could also be bad right? Like breaking something and walking on it ending up not healing right because too much damage. 
Not feeling pain has been documented many times, and for different reasons. That isn't necessarily a good thing either, we feel pain for a reason.  Healing without scarring? that seems much more interesting to me.
People who don’t feel pain or feel minimal pain have been known of for a while. Is this case special because of the quick healing or no scar thing?
The post title is a copy and paste from the title, subtitle and first paragraph of the linked popular press article here:   > Woman with ‘mutant’ gene who feels no pain and heals without scarring discovered by scientists   > ‘She reported numerous burns and cuts without pain, often smelling her burning flesh before noticing any injury’   > The case, published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, could open the door for a host of new treatments to help people recover from surgery, manage chronic pain and anxiety disorders.   Journal Reference:   Microdeletion in a FAAH pseudogene identified in a patient with high anandamide concentrations and pain insensitivity  Habib, Abdella M. et al.  British Journal of Anaesthesia , 2019  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2019.02.019  Link: https://bjanaesthesia.org/article/S0007-0912(19)30138-2/fulltext  Abstract  The study of rare families with inherited pain insensitivity can identify new human-validated analgesic drug targets. Here, a 66-yr-old female presented with nil requirement for postoperative analgesia after a normally painful orthopaedic hand surgery (trapeziectomy). Further investigations revealed a lifelong history of painless injuries, such as frequent cuts and burns, which were observed to heal quickly. We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder: the co-inheritance of (i) a microdeletion in dorsal root ganglia and brain-expressed pseudogene, FAAH-OUT, which we cloned from the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) chromosomal region; and (ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in FAAH conferring reduced expression and activity. Circulating concentrations of anandamide and related fatty-acid amides (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism. The genetic findings and elevated circulating fatty-acid amides are consistent with a phenotype resulting from enhanced endocannabinoid signalling and a loss of function of FAAH. Our results highlight previously unknown complexity at the FAAH genomic locus involving the expression of FAAH-OUT, a novel pseudogene and long non-coding RNA. These data suggest new routes to develop FAAH-based analgesia by targeting of FAAH-OUT, which could significantly improve the treatment of postoperative pain and potentially chronic pain and anxiety disorders.  
"We seem to find interesting ""mutants"" every now and then... but rarely seem to be able to replicate the results of their reported mutation. "
It's definitely the more interesting part to study. There have been plenty of people with fucked up pain receptors. I hope the article states that but it's 6am and I'm not down for that hunt.
> On clinical examination, she had multiple scars around the arms and on the back of her hands.   It's not that she didn't scar at all, she just had reduced scarring.
Yeah the feeling no pain part is no advantage. There are [know genetic disorders](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6379795/ns/health-childrens_health/t/rare-disease-makes-girl-unable-feel-pain/#.XJzQekjANaQ) that make people feel no pain and they need constant supervision as children because they end up hurting themselves without noticing. Not knowing that you are damaging your body is actually quite bad.
> She also had no emotional pain though  Curiouser and curiouser.
Whoa. That latter part is kinda scary. 
So... never scared and don't feel pain? It's actually quite impressive that she survived for that long without accidentally dying.  How does she judge whether a situation might be dangerous or how much is too much when it comes to sports, stretching, etc.? Did she just never get into a potentially dangerous situation? When if you fall down your your bike in an awkward manner and simply injure yourself internally and suddenly you die?   What about injured parts of your body like bones, tendons or muscles that still work but will get worse and eventually start getting permanently harmed/destroyed if you don't rest them?
Correct. Lack of pain often results in a premature death as you won’t feel a potentially fatal injury that needs to be treated. I think the big discovery here is the lack of scarring however.
"I thought this too. I even found this:  ""CIPA Disease: When a Person Can't Feel Pain. Congenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis (CIPA) is a rare hereditary disease that causes affected individuals to be unable to feel pain and unable to sweat (anhydrosis). It is also calledhereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN IV).Nov 1, 2017""  I think the no scarring is like super human..."
Sounds like the lack of scarring is the big discovery here. 
Ok. I understood maybe 5% of those words... can someone please ELI5 this..
I'm not exactly a scientist, but I think that's because often mutations are often caused by multiple genes switching on or off, and not a single one, and turning one gene on or off can have unexpected results.  Currently, I believe it is safety concerns which is holding us back in gene therapy, rather than a lack of procedures to do so.  
superficial scarring is protective, like giving yourself rhino hide in a survival / fight sense.
>  I hope the article states that but it's 6am and I'm not down for that hunt.  It's dissapointing how few people in this chain didn't appear to read the article - not to pick on this particular comment, but it's at the top.  What's unique about this woman is she helped researchers identify an otherwise 'junk piece of DNA' that actually ties in with the FAAH gene, having the effect of naturally reducing her pain, and perhaps anxiety as well.   She isn't just another person with 'fucked up pain receptors' and other junk that people are saying here. she's genetically unique. read, please. 
It's a good thing she has reduced scarring considering how she's more likely to have more scars or at least larger injuries due to not feeling pain and knowing when she had been injured.
Maybe in lacking pain, her autonomic nervous system doesn't cause standard response to injury like with inflammation and signaling. 
So the title is a lie...   Some people are more prone to scarring than others. Whats new about this study?
Or knowing something is wrong internally...that'd be the part that terrified me. 
Or more prone. Unscheduled proliferation of cells.
Imagine an army of soldiers that are pretty much fearless rambo's that don't feel pain. If anything this discovery will probably find its way to some obscure 'defense research project'
But not to her.
Kind of points to a brain anomaly in the region where pain is processed. Emotional pain is processed in the same region as physical.  Edit 2: while the emotional and physical pain holds, some people think the brain plays no role in the healing process. It’s true there are signaling cells at the site of the injury that kick off a cascade of healing although it’s still a highly researched topic because there’s a ton more to learn. If the issue is with the local signaling cells then I’d guess she has a genetic defect that renders signaling cells and pain receptors useless. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that pain receptors and emotional pain are hitting the same brain region.   Edit: also, if the brain is unaware of pain (injury) the normal repair response may not happen, meaning instead of sending out the troops to build scar tissue as quickly as possible it goes about just growing and sloughing cells like normal, which over time would fill in any injuries with normal tissue albeit slowly. That would be life threatening though if she had a major injury.
Kind of reminds me of that guy who can technically workout forever without feeling the burn, his muscles don't produce lactic acid, [he can run forever.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/aug/30/dean-karnazes-man-run-forever)
Probably more of a psychological connection, implying that anxiety and fear has some link to physical origins, so without the original physical pain, she never developed emotional fear.
"> lack of scarring however.  Title is click bait. ""On clinical examination, she had multiple scars around the arms and on the back of her hands"".  She has ""reduced scarring"" because of how fast she heals. "
Except she still gets scars just a reduced rate. This article is extremely click baity.
"A lady had a surgery that's usually pretty painful, but after the surgery she didn't need any pain meds. The docs must have thought ""hmm, that's weird."" Then she said that she had many injuries that didn't hurt in the past, and healed quickly.  They tested her genes (DNA code which is unique to each individual) and found several mutations (alterations in the typical code that people have).  Then they measured the levels of several substances in her blood which were significantly higher than normal.  They think maybe drugs can be developed based on these findings to help people with difficult-to-control pain issues.  Hope this helps a bit!"
Imagine if her heart doesn't scar after a myocardial infarction though.
Operative Nurse here - this is a common misconception.   I was taught in nursing school and re-taught by multiple surgeons that the rule of thumb is that scarring reduces tissue integrity by 1/3.   This is obviously case dependent (size of the scar (length and depth), quality of wound edge approximation, duration of healing time, level of mobility required by the wound, vascularity at the site of injury, etc etc).   This  one of the many reasons that surgeons are loathe to re-operate on a patient for the same issue multiple times, and also why athletes commonly suffer multiple re-injuries for things like rotator cuff repairs and ACL repairs: even after surgical repair, the affected tissues are now reliant on scar tissue to provide structural integrity, and it is weaker than undisrupted tissues. The more times that tissue is operated on, the weaker it gets as the scar tissue will never be able to fully replicate the original structure. 
Indeed, but, it's a function that is being made redundant by things like bandages and armour. If we can find out why her body has stopped producing scar tissue, we can potentially apply it to people so that things such as scar tissue build up is no longer a problem.
Yeah, I know someone who cant feel pain and they have LOADS of scars. 
"I get why you'd think this, but pain isn't the signal for inflammation and scarring at all. In this scenario, damage to cells and cell death is the cause of inflammation and repair (which is what scarring is). Pain is never a ""signal"" to induce these things, and the autonomic nervous system doesn't cause the response to injury in the first place."
There was a guy on here a while back who had a burst appendix with only mild discomfort and almost died.  Docs told him to get a checkup anytime he felt anything at all.
Can she have orgasms? 
Imagine trying to raise an army of toddlers that don't care that fire is hot or that bleeding is bad. Or that try to play with their broken bones.   Most people who don't feel pain die at a young age because they do things like stand in a campfire until they're dead. 
Clearly you never watched First Blood. 
*Title:* Scientists make shocking discovery that A = B!  *Reddit comments:* A ≠ B
Yeah, why is no one mentioning the fast healing?? That's the cool part! Not to mention being immune to anxiety and depression.
Does that mean that part would be weaker? 
I'm feel pain but it's far reduced compared to others and lots of times delayed. I get injured more than anyone I know. Even bone injuries haven't been a big problem(I've broken my thumb, toe and tailbone and just went on like normal) and they don't even feel like I should get them checked, I just do because I know that it's a possibility and that I can't tell between a sprain and a fracture. I have a wrist injury right now that I don't plan to get checked because I feel stupid for going to the hospital just for it to be a bad sprain again.   I feel like I'm super fragile though. I bruise easily, get dizzy or lethargic easy, I'm prone to anemia and I get sick ALL THE TIME. I'm also allergic to dust.  Irrelevant but interesting. Did you know you can cut a freckle in half and end up scarring with stripes instead?
I wonder how her body responds as far as adrenaline is concerned. The thought of pain or anticipating the feeling of an injury before it happens always gives me a high from adrenaline. 
Finally getting down to business
Yeah, Leprosy has a similar effect on nerves and they often have severely deformed hands because they don’t feel injuries. 
Or taken PCP
I love that about Reddit though. I'm super thankful that people here often take the time to explain the logistics of a solution and potential drawbacks and future options.
It would mean that after a possibly slower healing, there would be no long lasting damage to the heart which is common after heart attacks. 
You're most definitely at higher risk for a second heart attack after your first one, \[edit, I have been corrected, thanks u/DoctorBelay\]. But if this woman also doesn't form scar tissue on her heart after an event like that, it would be game changing for heart attack survivors.
I once had it explained to me as it's like patching a wall in a building.  You can't tear down the entire side of the building, and you don't want the elements getting inside, so you put up a tarp (the scab/clotting), then fill in the hole with bricks.  But it's obviously not a perfect reconstruction, since you don't have the time, resources, or ability to redo the entire wall without the building falling down.  There are imperfections, the job was a bit rushed, and it's not as seamless or strong as the original, but as long as no one hits the wall too hard again it'll hold.
She said she's never experienced an adrenaline rush. If you actually injected her with it though... Who knows
Babies, and even toddlers, are **very** bad at avoiding injury. I would assume that anticipation of pain is a learned response, otherwise young children spend a great deal of time ignoring their body freaking out and trying to get them to stop doing almost everything they do.
to defeat THE HUNS
More common issue is Diabetes. Diabetic Neuropathy is one of several reason why diabetics have such bad foot problems. Not only do they have far worse wound healing, they don't feel the wounds, so they continue to bump into things/walk on them/etc.
This is why I mainly get my information from Reddit threads nowadays. Obviously, every sub has its biases, but in almost every case there is some guy coming along screaming ‚incorrect!‘, starting a discussion.   It’s funny how most of the internet has realised that there is basically no objective news reporting and that only the extended discussion in the comments gives an actual idea about the concept. 
I'm wondering where the idea of a slower heal comes from. Did I miss something in the article about how it takes her longer to heal?
The Parks committee of Pawnee 
They expect us to take the title at face value, but little did they know, some of us actually read the content and others have actual knowledge on the subject at hand.
The idea that there has to be a trade off and there's no gain without loss, so ya it was made up based on how earlier people felt.
Better to have perfusion issues you can fix with stents than infarcted tissue that is unsalvageable, reduces blood flow out of the heart, and may cause an arrhythmia and future heart attacks
Thst isn't always true. Sometimes there are gains that are all gain which provide an evolutionary advantage. 
"For those not familiar with concrete, it typically is made from gravel, sand, cement, and water.  The water turns the cement powder into interlocking crystals that bind the other ingredients together.  There are a lot of recipes for concete, but the typical ""ordinary Portland Cement"" concrete is made with a cement that starts with about 5 parts limestone to 1 part shale.  These are burned in a high temperature kiln, which converts them chemically to a product that reacts with water.  Lots of other materials will do this too.  The ancient Romans dug up rock that had been burned by a volcano near Pozzolana, Italy.  The general category is thus called ""Pozzolans"". Coal furnace ash and blast furnace slag are also rocks that have been burned.  They have long been used as partial replacements for Portland Cement.  Rich husk ash and brick dust are other, less common, alternative cements.  Note: Natural coal isn't pure carbon.  It has varying amounts of rock mixed in with it. That's partly because the coal seams formed that way, and partly because the mining process sometimes gets some of the surrounding bedrock by accident.  Portland Cement got its name because the concrete it makes resembled  the natural stone quarried in Portland, England at the time."
Could be very useful in poor earthquake prone environments that often underuse rebar. This may offer some of that needed tensile strength. However, it would need to be specially tested for it.
How is the compressive strength compared to traditional concrete mix?
How does it hold up to extreme winters though?
How does this behave in a fire?
Worth noting that the process of burning the limestone and shale to make clinker is a bigger contributor to carbon dioxide emissions than any single country in the world except China or the US ([source](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-why-cement-emissions-matter-for-climate-change)). The construction industry, via the creation of cement, is killing the planet. [more](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46455844)
I did a paper in undergrad about Roman concrete. Their recipe was no joke. It’s a big reason why their stuff is still standing to this day.   Coliseum? Yup. Roman concrete. Oh and you know how some of the walls collapsed after an earthquake in 1500 something? Yeah those were the sections that were built by a different architect and he didn’t use the same materials.
It’s also worth noting that we cannot make concrete without sand (including the newest kind of concrete described in the post), and the process of gathering sand is terrible for the environment. Humans use more sand than any other resource except for air and water. The sand in concrete has to be water-derived sand, like the kind found on the bottom of the ocean or the banks of rivers. We can’t use desert sand to make concrete, as the edges of each grain are too smooth to be useful. So, in order to build new modern buildings and cities, countries are decimating their environments to access water-derived sand. We are destroying riverbanks, causing terrible flooding and decimating fish populations. We are digging up entire islands that are uninhabited by humans and mining beaches until erosion becomes problematic in the surrounding areas. You can probably guess that these issues are especially unregulated in countries like India and China that are constructing new buildings at dizzying rates.   There’s no easy solution. Cities are not possible without concrete. Concrete makes human lives safer and better, and currently, concrete isn’t physically possible without sand. Enforced regulations in all countries are essential, but that is easier said than done. People in affluent counties can renovate instead of building new homes form scratch and can get used to living in smaller homes/hotels/offices rather than trying to make every space a maximum luxury.   Here’s a summary of the book that describes this whole sand issue in depressing and fascinating detail: https://www.npr.org/2018/08/05/635748605/the-story-of-sand-in-the-world-in-a-grain
Could be usefull here in sweden where the roads look like they have been in an earthquake
This is the real question. Concrete has incredible load bearing ability, especially for its cost and weight. Sure the new stuff might be less brittle, but if it cannot hold up to compressive forces, it might not be an adequate replacement.
Right? This night be fine for a sidewalk, but the real question is, can you pour a foundation with it.
Yeah, sounds like it would be good road material.
Correct.  Concrete is the single most used solid product on Earth, and about 1/6 of the mass is cement.  Burning rock to make cement is done at *very* high temperatures, and usually by burning fossil fuels.  In theory, a solar furnace could be used, but nobody has developed an economical way to do it yet.  Tests have been run with small amounts in solar furnaces, so we know it works, but not on an industrial scale.
"I'm just gonna say this as a fully bought in climate change believer or knower..  every damn time I hear about ""biggest contributor"" it's some new thing."
For the  Pantheon they used different grades of concrete made with different additives depending on the qualities they required. The dome has pumice included to make it light for example. It has stood for around 2000 years without being rebuilt.  Edit:  Pantheon
Concrete as a road surface shouldn't be used in areas where there are extreme differences in temperatures in the first place.  Given Sweden regularly has warm summers and cold winters, it could be argued in some parts there's a difference of 50°c between hot and cold periods, which will definitely ruin the concrete.
I didnt research this particular cement mixture but I was part of a team that was researching something similar. Its compressive strength was pretty much the same while it's tensile force was 100-500x stronger. The last time I was apart of it we were testing it for roads. Our test was a 200meter solid concrete pad that was road tested. 200 meters of solid concrete with no joints. Because of its strength, joints were no longer needed. If any cracks did show it was able to heal itself when exposed to water.   I do not know if it is economically feasible. The material costs were over 2x that of regular concrete. The cost savings come in to play because no joints have to be cut. I'm no longer apart of the team but I would love to see this come to our roads and bridges.
it's not just the fuel use that dumps out CO2 - limestone is calcium carbonate, and the process of making cement releases the carbonate as CO2 as the limestone converts into calcium oxide.  A cool thing that happens though is that the curing process with concrete involves carbon dioxide reforming carbonates within the crystalline structure, however i don't think it ever captures as much CO2 as it releases during manufacture.
It's how you contextualize the data.  By country, by industry, by product, by process etc. Statistics say different things based on how you compare them.
Yes, but that rate is very slow. So for a building designed for 50 years, the concrete will still be co2-positive.  As a side note, buildings are a necessity, just like food and clothing. It also takes up volumes, as it should be bigger than us. Thus it is no wonder that the construction industry is a big contributor. Whatever our economic standard, buildings will always be a big contributor.  Concrete has some very qualities that make it an efficient material, like insulation, production and installation. I don't have the numbers now, but due to its efficiency it could still be a better alternative than using steel or timber for all our construction works.
Yup. It’s quite amazing the amount of knowledge they had. A lot of that knowledge was lost when the empire fell.   They think the secret to the quality was the volcanic rock used, and if I recall, it was especially good at setting underwater even.
In Southern Canada we get tempretures that swing between -40c in  the winter and +40c in the summer. Concrete on structures is constantly being touched up and any roads made of it are often in pretty rough shape. Most of them are asphalt.
Using waste products is somewhat unreliable too.  Quality varies greatly between batches.  Not a reason not to do it, but it adds some cost.
Common sense dictates that if it were that pliable, your wheels would also experience tremendous rolling resistance with all your weight digging into such a small footprint.
It captures 43% of the CO2 created during conversion per https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161121130957.htm
Limestone does scrub and capture massive amounts of SO2, so there’s that.
Yes and no. They had an amazing depth of institutional empirical knowledge but that shouldn’t be confused with theoretical knowledge.  So they knew that crushing up rocks from a specific quarry produced a certain result. But extremely limited understanding of why. When people say “the secret of concrete was lost after the Roman Empire fell” its not about a bunch of people suddenly forgetting the recipe. They literally lost track of the particular hole in the ground that concrete came out of.
There's a bit more to it than that, salt plays a big part in it:   https://www.nature.com/news/seawater-is-the-secret-to-long-lasting-roman-concrete-1.22231
Asphalt, tarmac or even compressed hard core are far better surfaces than concrete in many countries.  Concrete is a wonder material until weather is a factor.  Edit: not everyone will know what hardcore means in this context; it's typically gravel/crushed concrete around 40mm in diameter used as a sub-base for roads, blinding in trenches and is the large aggregate used in concrete. In the UK it's typically called hardcore or MOT Type 1.
Because crummy roads destroy tires
cheers, wasn't sure of the exact numbers so i just left a generalized statement.
This thread is a literal TIL  Thank you all for this information
Also, a lot of the reason these ancient concrete structures stand for so long is because everything is built in compression.  Modern construction uses reinforced concrete, which allows for more efficient building techniques, but the steel reinforcement can rust and decay, causing failure of the member.
How could the Romans study crystallization and determine the best recipe with the technology they had?
There's also simple survivorship bias.  We only see the remarkable structures that survived. We don't see all the crappy structures that didn't.
Obviously they didn't and either came up with their recipe through trial and error or it was a lucky coincidence.
Too late. Just finished writing my thesis on SO2 and CO2 capture, using this thread as my source.
I wouldn't really count that. It isn't like there were hundreds of pantheons and only one survived. There was only one 2000 years ago and one today.  It held the record for the largest dome ever constructed for well over 1000 years and only beaten by a significant amount in the 1900s.  Edit: It wasn't a dumb comment though. It was good of you to look out for this type of bias.
"The article said: ""The Romans may have got their ideas from studying how ash from volcanic eruptions crystallized into durable rock, Jackson says.""  I was curious how they studied it. Pliny also was quoted as saying it got stronger by the day. Was wondering how they measured that."
They hit it with a pickaxe and saw how much chipped off each day. 10/10
This probably isn't a million miles from the truth to be honest.
Mental health nurse here; I have had to explain Wakefield's fraudulent study and the compelling evidence in favour of vaccine safety to a family very recently in order to assure them they did the right thing in vaccinating their child.  It's important to remain professional and to not belittle families' experiences or concerns - and I've found that if I explain the evidence and the natural history of autism (ie, that it often first becomes apparent at the age that MMR is given) sensitively, folk will listen and understand. 
At this point, is there any real medical ambiguity?  This whole thing started with a study that the author admitted was untrue, and retracted.   Feels like we're in a state of *To one who understands, no more evidence is necessary. To one who decides not to, no explanation is possible.*
[Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism: A Nationwide Cohort Study](https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2727726/measles-mumps-rubella-vaccination-autism-nationwide-cohort-study)  Published: Ann Intern Med. 2019.  DOI: 10.7326/M18-2101  >**Abstract**  >**Background:**  The hypothesized link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism continues to cause concern and challenge vaccine uptake.  >**Objective:**  To evaluate whether the MMR vaccine increases the risk for autism in children, subgroups of children, or time periods after vaccination.  >**Design:**  Nationwide cohort study.  >**Setting:**  Denmark.  >**Participants:**  657 461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 31 December 2010, with follow-up from 1 year of age and through 31 August 2013.  >**Measurements:**  Danish population registries were used to link information on MMR vaccination, autism diagnoses, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors to children in the cohort. Survival analysis of the time to autism diagnosis with Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of autism according to MMR vaccination status, with adjustment for age, birth year, sex, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score).  >**Results:**  During 5 025 754 person-years of follow-up, 6517 children were diagnosed with autism (incidence rate, 129.7 per 100,000 person-years). Comparing MMR-vaccinated with MMR-unvaccinated children yielded a fully adjusted autism hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.02). Similarly, no increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination was consistently observed in subgroups of children defined according to sibling history of autism, autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score) or other childhood vaccinations, or during specified time periods after vaccination.  >**Limitation:**  No individual medical chart review was performed.  >**Conclusion:**  The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.  >**Primary Funding Source:**  Novo Nordisk Foundation and Danish Ministry of Health.  
"People keep asking ""well then what *does* cause autism?  Lots of things can. One such cause: infection with rubella (preventable by the MMR vaccine) during pregnancy causes congenital rubella syndrome.  Among other effects, it also causes autism.  https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/pregnancy.html"
Exactly. The best way to change someone's mind is to use friendly and neutral language. Insulting someone will simply turn them off from listening to you.  Edit: a word
I also find it interesting that autism is seen as a far worse outcome than other diseases. 
Thank you for taking the time to do this and explaining the timing.  My child was diagnosed Autistic at 23 months.  Received MMR at 24 months.  I guess Autism causes vaccines?
"No. We've studied this exact question at least 10 times, and every time it comes up negative. There is no reason to suspect that there is any connection between vaccination and autism, and it has been thoroughly studied.  Additionally, we have a more plausible explanation for the apparent rise in autism cases. One is increased vigilance. Many autism diagnoses that happen today would not have been diagnosed that way 20 or 30 years ago, and would've been diagnosed as something else, or the person would've simply be considered a little abnormal but with no official diagnosis, or simply would've never been sent to a mental health professional in the first place. And a widening of the autistic spectrum, where more conditions/behaviors fall under the autism umbrella. Those factors alone explain the apparent rise in autism.  Additionally, I don't have the cite handy but there was a study about 3-4 years ago that tried to analyze people with records of mental problems from a wide group of ages. It was found that if you apply the new methods for diagnosing autism, and use the new, wider autistic spectrum, there's no decrease in rate for autism diagnosis (under modern standards) for older people.  If autism actually were on the rise - if more people have what we consider autism now than they did 20, 30, 40 years ago - then you would expect young people to be diagnosed with autism at a greater rate than older people, *using the same criteria*. But adjusting for modern classifications and diagnostic methods, that didn't happen - young and old people had the same expected rates of autism diagnosis.   What this means is that autism is not actually on the rise, only the diagnosis of autism, and what falls into the autistic spectrum. There is no ""autism epidemic"" that needs to be explained, and vaccines definitively do not cause autism. The whole thing is a manufactured conspiracy theory."
Pretty interesting to me that despite the hazard ratio being nonsignificant, the point estimate actually suggests a 7% lower risk of autism with MMR vaccination. Makes me wonder if anti-vax sentiment is stronger in people with other risk factors for autism, such as a previous child with the diagnosis. 
They act like the diseases the vaccines prevent don’t have a chance of giving the child autism through brain damage. Yeah, he can get measles and never have it again. He’ll never have it again because he died from having a 105 degree temperature. 
I thought autism is a genetic disorder. 
With people who are combative I frequently use questions about their own theories to encourage critical thinking. It’s a lot more effective than just telling someone they are wrong. 
Correct. Another piece of advice I can give in that regard is to always think of another as a potential information output instead of just focusing on their flaws. If you can bother to be around someone use their output to find a fitting construct of words and also acknowledge knowledge. 
It's because they've simply not lived in an era when those diseases were killing and crippling people.
"It can be. Saying ""autism"" is like saying ""cancer"" - its a way of grouping a common set of outcomes that can be caused by any one or more of a wide number of factors. In some people, they have a gene that predisposes them to it. In others, its a random mutation or the effect of an outside influence like a virus.  Genetics can be a cause, and honestly, are probably a factor in the majority, but in some it may be that they wouldn't have had it manifest without a reaction while in utero (like an autoimmune reaction). "
"The thing with that method is that you've got to be pretty knowledgeable about the subject in the first place.  I very often find myself thinking, ""I'm pretty sure that's wrong, but I don't know enough about X to dispute that."" "
"It's just kind of a crummy mentality to have towards autistic children. ""Ewww, my kid could be autistic, it's the worst possible outcome."" "
You also have to be having the discussion with someone who is interested in having a discussion. Some people just want to be right. 
It definitely impacts the autistic community - we know that they hate us. And so we fight against that with our experiences and loving ourselves as we are. That mentality you mentioned really turns me off from antivaxx all together - I'm not a fate worse than death. 
"Watched a documentary once where scientists injected radioactive material (just enough to be traceable) into the trees. Wish I could remember the name of the doc. They traced the material and found that older, more firmly established trees would actually redirect resources to the younger, more ""needy"" trees and help them to grow. r/natureislit."
"Here's a link to a Radiolab episode from last year called [""Smarty Plants""](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/smarty-plants), which talks about this (and other stuff). It's frikkin crazy."
How might this fit with what we know about sunlight and nutrient competition between neighboring trees?
This is already something that has been known for quite a while, groves can be one unit as opposed to individuals. One of the most famous being Pando, which is estimated to be like 80,000 years old.  Wiki below for anyone interested:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree)
I suggest reading the book “The Hidden Life of Trees.” It was published a few years ago, and is absolutely eye opening. Tons of facts like this one in there.
"Ever since I read Alan Moore's ""Swamp Thing"" (and also took LSD), I've had a really deep-in-the-gut feeling that plants have something seriously intelligent going on that we simply don't understand due to our uniquely human limits. I'm eager to see what the scientific community uncovers in the coming years, as it seems there's been a big increase in studies such as this, which question the beliefs and theories that many hold as common sense."
This OP and many of the top comment’s ~~factoids~~ *snippets of information* are directly from a European forestry worker who wrote the book “The Hidden Life of Trees” for those interested. It’s an amazing read.
Was it [Do Trees Communicate?](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2139811/) I learned about Mother Trees in an ecosystem management class. Mindblowing!
Aww mama trees taking care of their little babies
There’s also the [episode](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/from-tree-to-shining-tree?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)“from tree to shining tree” from 2016 where they talk about the underground root system and the role a certain type of fungus plays in it
Peter Wohlleben talks about this in *The Hidden Life of Trees* (2015) as well.
EDIT: Changed theory to hypothesis. Sorry if I misled anyone.  Interestingly, there’s a hypothesis that the evolutionary origins of depression were a kind of self-isolation in response to infection, to keep it from spreading. According to this hypothesis, pathological depression could be caused by elevated inflammatory proteins, whether in response to or in the absence of an actual infection.  (Disclaimer: this is still just a hypothesis. There is some scientific evidence to support it, but it’s far from established fact. Even if it’s true, it may only account for some cases. Anyone who’s interested should probably start with ‘The Inflamed Mind’ by Ed Bullmore.)  It makes me wonder whether a tree could develop a pathological response where it “thinks” it’s infected, causing it to kill off the surrounding trees.
There are fungi that interconnect root tips to share nutrients with other trees. In many cases it’s sharing within the same species for species dominance. It’s by this process that trees help fight and prevent infection or insect attacks within their “community”.   Other fungi actually share nutrients across multiple competing species to ensure biodiversity in the forest. This is to the fungi’s advantage because a monoculture forest is more likely to suffer a decimating infection. By sharing the nutrients and maintaining diversity, the fungi ensure that the entire forest will not collapse from a single disease. The loss of the entire forest would dissipate the microclimate (created by a forest) which the fungi need to survive.
I’m definitely not an expert, but the climate of Auckland seems pretty mild. Maybe in nutrient-rich environments, plants get more benefit from cooperating instead of competing.
The cool thing is that this could really be about the blue people universe or the bending universe!
>factoids  I thought you were about to nuke this thread by debunking all of that
So glad someone mentioned this! It is a good read, however the translation (original written language is German) feels a bit.. basic. It's by Peter Wohlleben for those who are interested, some really fascinating stuff!
Yes, that's the one. She also did a good TED Talk on the subject. It's not the tree roots themselves doing this, but it's the root's symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi that allow such intricate connections and transfers to take place.
Not to pop the mystique, but its actually done by mycorrhizal fungi that bind to the roots of any trees they find in the soil.   When trees are young, the fungi provides large amounts of nutrients to speed growth. Then once the tree is established within the canopy, the fungi takes its payment in the form of sugar, produced by the plant via photosynthesis, which it uses to feed itself and promote the growth of other trees its bound to.   They essentially have an underground investor who takes a cut of their pay after they make it big.
I hoped to find mention of this.  That episode gave me goose bumps.
That’s a hypothesis, not a theory. Super importance difference, especially in a public setting. As obvious as it may seem to you, using theory and hypothesis interchangeably is what allows creationists to call evolution and climate change “just theories”.
Most of these responses are not driven by the tree as much as the fungal network associated with the tree roots.
Although seemingly plant like. Fungi are actually closer related to us than plants
Ya, you can tell it's an Aspen because of the way it is
Ist the same in German. That guy drives home his barely scientific claims by repetition instead of scientific proof. He lets you pay 150€ for an evening round with him. And invites 9 other people. That dude is basically a Televangalist for trees.
Same, it was thrilling
I never fully understood the scientific method until reading this comment. 🤦🏻‍♂️
I just replied similarly above. Mycelium may be the neurons of the Earth.
Yes! Because they're heterotrophs like us!
I don’t recall anything unsupported. His language is admittedly a bit anthropomorphic at times, but perhaps that’s just because we assume that terms like “remember” “feel” “cooperate” etc are strictly human functions.  I read some criticism, especially on his use of plant “memory”. But the scientific backlash wasn’t against his observations but against the term “remember”  because plants have no nervous system.  That being said, what else do you call it when an organism experiences a new stimuli, then the second time it experiences that stimuli it responds with a new adaptive behavior?
Never thought I’d hear the word “thrilling” used in relation to tree root systems, but here we are. Thanks for that
Had to look that up. It means they only eat organic carbon, unlike plants which can make food from inorganic materials.
Symbiosis, the word for it is honestly quite beautiful.
Honesty after I wrote it, I stopped and questioned if it was too extra, but thrilling it was.
Am I interpreting the hazard ratio correctly, where 1.96 is nearly double the chance of heart failure for obese vs. normal weight?
The conversation 'should' be about how unhealthy obesity is, not about whether it's socially acceptable. That's the issue
Peer reviewed:   Metabolically Healthy Obese and Incident Cardiovascular Disease Events Among 3.5 Million Men and Women.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28911506   >RESULTS:  >During a mean follow-up of 5.4 years, obese individuals with no metabolic abnormalities had a higher risk of CHD (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 1.54), cerebrovascular disease (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.11), and heart failure (HR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.86 to 2.06) compared with normal weight individuals with 0 metabolic abnormalities. Risk of CHD, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure in normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals increased with increasing number of metabolic abnormalities.  >CONCLUSIONS:  >Metabolically healthy obese individuals had a higher risk of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure than normal weight metabolically healthy individuals. Even individuals who are normal weight can have metabolic abnormalities and similar risks for cardiovascular disease events. 
I think body positivity was a necessary corrective to prevalent social attitudes about women’s bodies; I know a lot of women who were a BMI around 24 or 25 and were repeatedly called fat or unsightly and who starved themselves regularly to try to lose weight, despite being in a healthy range.  It’s now gone a little insane with people whose weights are going to kill them early trying to justify their current state of being.  I get their perspective - I was obese for almost ten years, and I am not confident that I will be able to keep the weight I have lost off. But there’s a difference between asserting, “I am unhealthy but not deserving of abuse”, and “I AM HEALTHY DAMNIT. NOBODY NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT”. One is a necessary change to society and one is a dangerous delusion. 
This post is six hours old and no one has mentioned this (*edit: in the top 200 comments): > That goes for people who are considered underweight as well. The new study found, for example, that underweight individuals with no metabolic problems were at higher risk for stroke than normal weight, overweight or obese people with no metabolic problems, and if underweight people had metabolic issues, their risk increased even further. 
The risk factors affecting cardiovascular disease risk are extremely interconnected - one risk factor will almost always increase or worsen another.  One of the most evidence-based and longstanding risk calculators we use for patients at risk of CVD is the [Framingham Risk Calculator](https://www.mdcalc.com/framingham-coronary-heart-disease-risk-score). Risk factors include Age, Sex, Smoking status, Total and HDL cholesterol level, BP, and BP medication status. This risk calculator calculates the risk of heart attack in 10 years, and is often a very poignant statistic to share with patients.  Obesity is known to affect almost all of these modifiable risk factors - being obese is associated with poor lipid metabolism, and we know that more weight on your body will increase your blood pressure. Often, one of the first things we tell people to do when they come in with slightly elevated BP is to try to lose weight.  If anything, this study reinforces the already large amount/longstanding data that tells us that obesity is bad. Was this study important to do? Sure - it's always important to reaffirm relevance and accuracy of dated evidence.   *Edited for spelling, changes pointed to in comments
For longevity (or whatever is the opposite of morbidity) there are minimal contraindications to the following: Sleep is to be maximized Exercise is to be maximized Obesity is to be minimized
I do like how they pump the brakes early on: doesn’t include diet, or lifestyle, or activity levels, or record accurate fat%; it’s BMI only, weighed against their eHR.  Yet this is also good to drive home that, no, you likely cannot be “obese but healthy”. You need to be within a healthy weight range as determined by you and your physician, and that being above that range can be significantly detrimental to your health.  I would be very curious to see these results when fat% and exercise are taken into account, personally, to get a better idea of how much of an improvement needs to be made to reduce risk. It’s easy to say “lose 100lbs to be healthy”, but what effect on my health does losing 10lbs have? 20lbs? Smaller, short term goals that have known payoffs could really help motivate people, like “losing 10lbs off my current 300lbs will reduce my chance of stroke by 5% over the next five years,” or similar.
And that is for the purportedly healthy people.
"The hazard function is NOT a probability. It is NOT a chance. It is NOT an odds. The hazard function is the ""instantaneous rate of the event"". When the study says that the hazard ratio is 1.96 this is best interpreted as ""if you had really really large populations of two groups, the rate at which the one group is experiencing the event is 1.96 times the rate that the other group experiences the event"". It's kind on awkward measure for survival analysis but it is common because of the popularity of the Cox Proportional Hazards model.   Edit to add my sources  First, am PhD candidate in biostatistics doing dissertation in survival analysis  Second, Wikipedia actually has a decent article on the proportional hazards model  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model"
Honestly, I'm surprised it's that small
Wait, so are all sumo wrestlers doomed with heart failiures and death?
I think the manner in which you go about having that conversation is an issue, just like any other problem a person has, from mental illness to alcoholism, it has to be approached with compassion and tact. 
>But critics say the analysis, based on the electronic health records of 3.5 million British patients who were followed from 1995 to 2015, leaves a lot out. Doctors’ records don’t typically capture lifestyle habits, so the study fails to account for the wide-ranging effects of diet. They classify weight status by using body mass index, a formula based on height and weight that doesn’t distinguish muscle from fat. Most important, critics say, such analyses don’t take fitness level or physical activity into account.
">This same process is the reason why smoking took so long to be declared hazardous to your health in a legal and scientific way.  That's pretty misleading. Smoking took a long time to be considered unhealthy because of an aggressive propaganda campaign and years of ""scientists"" working for Big Tobacco claiming that smoking is healthy."
"Agreed. I have always interpreted Body Positivity as meaning ""you are overweight, but you are still a human being and do not deserve to have nasty names screamed at you in public."""

The healthy at every size movement would like to have a word with you.
"There is a ""healthy at any weight"" movement but it's very fringe (rightfully so). Still the kind of thing that triggers Reddit hard."
"While technically correct; we have an obesity epidemic, not a bodybuilder one. Bringing that up every time BMI is used just gives all the obese who read it a false belief that they are not among the cohort.  ""I'm not fat, I'm just heavily muscled""... sure."
Actually, BMI works very well. You may think that having a lot of muscle is better, and in many ways it is, but if we're talking about heart problems, body mass is detrimental either way. It had to do with resistance to flow. Someone with more knowledge could probably explain it better, but I just saw this debated on Reddit not long ago and the numbers backed up BMI as a good measure.
[BMI underestimates](http://www.biomedcentral.com/2052-9538/1/9) obesity on the whole, actually. 
"> healthy people.  Only if your definition is ""no heart defect"". I think there might be other influences on health though."
">if you had really really large populations of two groups, the rate at which the one group is experiencing the event is 1.96 times the rate that the other group experiences the event  So if you had a population of obese people and a population of ""normal weight"" people, the obese population would have heart failure at 1.96 times the rate of the other population. In other words, the obese population is nearly twice as likely to experience heart failure.  I'm having trouble seeing the distinction here.  Edit: my two favourite explanations:  * For laymen: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/795tpr/healthy_obesity_doesnt_exist_obesity_is_not_a/dozuyci/?st=j9arr3xh&sh=cb6b96e5) by /u/qyll  * For those with a solid understanding of calculus and statistics: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/795tpr/healthy_obesity_doesnt_exist_obesity_is_not_a/dozttbd/?st=j9arr6l2&sh=5ff79c76) by /u/BuckUte"
That's comparing normal BMI individuals to those who are obese but do not display indicators of poor health like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.   Since you're selecting out those indicators of poor health, the hazard ratio goes way down relative to the difference if all obese people were included.  The study is specifically addressing health in obese people that 'appear' healthy by common metrics.
Even bodybuilders and power lifters are doomed to heart failure as they work their heart VERY hard to push limits.  More body mass = more work for heart period.
96% (of the baseline risk) higher chance of developing heart failure (which is caused by heart damage usually ischemia).   Comparing healthy (normal bp and cholesterol, no diabetes) obese vs non-obese. Its a single population, retrospective, chart review study, which is generally not considered very rigorous.   Edit for clarity
"What? No, it's not. It says right in the abstract that the ""multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR]"" is 1.96 for heart failure, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.86-2.06. "
">They classify weight status by using body mass index, a formula based on height and weight that doesn’t distinguish muscle from fat.  This criticism is raised often but mostly ill-applied. You have to be abnormally muscular relative to the normal human for BMI to ""not work"" for you, and most people aren't bodybuilders or athletes of any kind. It is overwhelmingly the case that for broad population statistics, people with obese BMIs are correctly inferred to be fat."
"Although BMI is not a perfect measurement of obesity, the correlation it draws here is sound. If you think about it, arguing that BMI is an inaccurate measurement in this study means that either very healthy and muscular people are being incorporated into the ""Obesity"" subgroup, or that very unhealthy and out-of-shape people that are skinny are being incorporated into the ""non-obese"" group. Both cases would mean that the hazard ratio, if anything, is being **underestimated** rather than overestimated.  So unless one is trying to argue that having a large muscle mass is a risk factor for strokes, heart failure, or coronary artery disease, it's a fairly strong correlation."
"Those seem like criticisms that would *lower* the rate of ""obese"" people with heart problems"
It scares me as well that the type of eating we do here in the US makes food almost seem like a drug instead of a form of sustenance. It feels fantastic to eat cake and drink soda because it tastes great,  but other than a load of macronutrients, there really isn’t much there in the way of nutrition.   I hope the mindset goes back to seeing food as what it is: fuel for the body. Maybe then we can start putting the right things in front of ourselves instead of binging on Doritos and soda because we have to eat “something that tastes good.”  Edit: suppose I shouldn’t restrict this to just the US, but that’s where the problem is the most apparent.
I think it means they don't have any existing conditions other than being overweight.
"Perhaps you're viewing 1.96 as a cumulative incidence ratio and not a hazard ratio? This is why scientists can conclude things like ""smokers have twice the risk of death compared to nonsmokers"". Of course everyone dies, but smokers die off at twice the rate of nonsmokers.   Another example: take 1000 smokers and 1000 nonsmokers and follow them through their entire lives. By the end of follow-up, smokers have the same chance of dying as the nonsmokers (1000 deaths vs. 1000 deaths), but their hazard is much higher because their deaths occurred early on in follow-up whereas nonsmokers died later on in follow-up. Because survival analysis uses time-to-event data, the hazard ratio can be quite large even if the number of events are the same in both groups."
That's actually what I was most curious about. Do you have anything on NFL linemen versus the average American?
"Most/all of the admittedly large number of lifters who die young or have shorter lifespans likely has a lot more to do with the drugs they're on than anything else.    You're not wrong, having a ton of extra muscle mass strains the heart and organs in a lot of similar ways as being obese.  But in general it is difficult or even impossible for a non-enhanced lifter to reach a dangerous point like that.  Your body places natural limits on the amount of extra muscle you can build, and for most people, I would say that the body is not going to let them build and carry so much extra muscle that it's going to kill them.  There have been a lot of studies done on this, where people have looked at top natural bodybuilders of all time to figure out where these limits probably are.    I believe for like a 5'10 (average) man, the consensus is somewhere just under 200lb would be his natural limit, at a not-ridiculously-lean bodyfat (such as 10%).  If you put a 5'10 200lb male into a BMI calculator, he's still not ""obese"".  Of course we all know BMI is dumb for men who lift weights, but this is just to illustrate my point; even a world-class natural lifter really cannot get anywhere close to what would qualify as an ""obese"" BMI as long as he remains fairly lean.  And of course most lifters will never even get that far.  But then people use drugs, which obviously risk unhealthy side effects, to punch through those limits.  So now they're using unnatural substances to jack up their body to an unnatural limit where it will start getting too strained.  That's why these dudes are dying.  I don't at all believe that it's the actual strain or work of lifting that is ""dooming"" these guys.  It's pretty widely accepted that the strain and work of lifting weights is extremely healthy for your heart, like it's one of the main benefits of the activity, just like it improves bone density and such.  "
If I understand stats correctly, it is showing that at any time-point, the obese group is diagnosed with heart failure at a rate twice as high as the control group.
I feel like the problem is that BMI was originally designed for analyzing entire populations and not a individuals, right? So even if there are outliers, it won't prevent BMI from being an accurate assessment of a large enough data set, right?  If you wanted to track a small number of people, I'd imagine you would use body fat percentage.
Yeah, people always raise that point about BMI.... But if you're talking about 3.5 million people then it's probably a pretty accurate way to gauge obesity.  What percentage of 300 pound people have less than 15% bodyfat? .001%?
I thought the same thing as well, if more actually fit, very muscular people with high BMIs were counted as obese, that would skew the data for the obese population in a positive direction. 
A large part of the reason people eat the way they do is the same reason people used to, and still smoke: stress. Our world is filled with heinousness and forces people can't control on a daily basis.
"No, in this study ""healthy"" means no diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. "
There was a [study](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/pdfs/NFL_Notification_01.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwiNq8Xe_JHXAhWBPJQKHeFyCcYQFggqMAE&usg=AOvVaw3DFz32BZSsoj8AHIBZGoiA) done on just this, where they compared longevity of different positions vs the general population. Most of the positions were far healthier than the average population in terms of heart disease, except defensive linesmen.  > We found players who had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or more during their playing years had twice the risk of death from heart disease compared to other players.
"Contrary to what most people think, a study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that ""NFL players are actually living longer than men in the general population.""  Source: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/pdfs/NFL_Notification_01.pdf"
Exactly, it is the best measurement for a large population in a study. The anomalies that exist don't over rule a strong correlation.
"Oh, way less than .001%.  [This](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/images/2006/bg62_1024.jpg) is what 305lb at 5'11"" looks like when it's genuinely lean mass instead of fat.  Granted that Ronnie Coleman competed at < 5% body fat, but 15% would still look totally insane.  Schwarzenegger himself topped out at 235lb competition weight at 6'2"".  Never went higher than 260lb in the offseason."
"Big sugar, also the perpetrator of the ""low fat"" trend in foods over the past 20-30 years."
Okay thanks for the specifics 
Other than when they are young (say under 30) I didn't know obese people existed without at least one of those preconditions. Then again I suppose they are determining obesity with BMI.
Briefly scanning the article, the crux appears to be a mathematical calculation of expected vs. actual deaths. This doesn't help much though, as the average NFL salary is much higher than the national average, leading to better access to (preventative or otherwise) health care that a normal citizen would not have.
is that because they have health insurance? 
No, it is common to be moderately obese and not have any of those 3 preconditions. In fact hyperlipidemia is starting to seem to have more to do with genetic predisposition than diet or weight.
It's common in young adults, people who are over 50 and obese almost always have at least one of those conditions.
"""My blood work is fine"" he will say. My guess is he is young still and the effects haven't caught up with him. Too many folk in their 20s and 30s think there are no problems because the impact hasn't hit them yet."
The time was changed from 7:55am to 8:50a.  In Seattle, sunrise ranges from 6:30am to 8:00am during the school year. This change didn't just give them more or better sleep, it made them more likely to be exposed to sunlight before school for more of the year. 
My highschool was considering changing the times from 8 am to 8:30. Most people didn't want to change because they didn't want to get home later.  Mind you that my country doesn't even have school buses, some people cycle to school on a bycicle for 40 minutes every morning. They still didn't want the later start time.
Every time they test less class time or reduced homework it yields positive results. Give these kids a break and do this!
In Seattle, Washington, delaying the start time of two high schools by nearly an hour lengthened students' daily sleep by more than half an hour, and was associated with reduced sleepiness and increased academic performance. Notably, in the students at the school that was more economically disadvantaged, the delayed start time was also associated with an increase in punctuality and attendance. These results offer quantitative evidence that delaying school start times is beneficial for students. In addition, given the distinct positive effects of this effort on students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, implementing this change in school policy, the authors say, could contribute to a decrease in the learning gap between low and high socioeconomic groups.   https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/aaft-dhs121018.php  http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/12/eaau6200
Why are we still following a school schedule, designed for farming families in the 1920's?   Kids get out of school at 3pm, and parents have to work until 5. This was fine when one parent always stayed home, but as a society, we really don't operate that way any longer.
I wonder how extra-cirriculars factor in. I had music classes before regular school from 7-8am every day, then regular school started at 8. I bet if they delayed it to 9 the band teacher would just call a 2 hour rehearsal before class!
I’ve been arguing for this for years. We should start little kids earlier and high school students later. It benefits both age groups to do so. It’s about time someone finally implemented this.
"It can also reduce depression, substance abuse, and car accidents:  ""Major findings: The results from this three-year research study, conducted with over 9,000 students in eight public high schools in three states, reveal that high schools that start at 8:30 AM or later allow for more than 60% of students to obtain at least eight hours of sleep per school night. Teens getting less than eight hours of sleep reported significantly higher depression symptoms, greater use of caffeine, and are at greater risk for making poor choices for substance use. Academic performance outcomes, including grades earned in core subject areas of math, English, science and social studies, plus performance on state and national achievement tests, attendance rates and reduced tardiness show significantly positive improvement with the later start times of 8:35 AM or later. Finally, the number of car crashes for teen drivers from 16 to 18 years of age was significantly reduced by 70% when a school shifted start times from 7:35 AM to 8:55 AM.""  From the Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of Minnesota: https://www.spps.org/cms/lib010/MN01910242/Centricity/Domain/7352/final_version_3-11-14_start_time_report.pdf  That study and tons of other really interesting things were in the book ""Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams"" by Matthew Walker"
I think people want to be able to drop their kids off at school and still have time to get to work by 8AM or 9AM.
"1) Because research also indicates that more contact hours with teachers leads to higher performance, and the lay reader may think delayed start necessarily means shorter days.  2) Because many parents rely on school-as-daycare and delayed start may adversely affect many parents' ability to get to work on time.  3) Because we have 100 years of tradition and social infrastructure built around public schools as they are, and heaven forbid you ever change anything ""because that's not how I was taught."""
From someone who has worked in a large school district, the main reason is the cost of bussing. One fleet of buses services elementary, middle and high schools. The start of those schools must be staggered for the buses to service all the students and high school is the first to start in order to allow students to have after school activities such as athletics.   It's a terrible reason and I wish they would change it but until you can convince these school districts to increase transportation funding significantly, that's the way its gonna stay.
I went to high school in Washington and had to walk in the dark to school most winter mornings. It sucks and pretty much just ended up causing me to nap in my first period every time
There is actually another effect: because the start times are later, the commute to school coincides with normal working traffic, and students end up with a longer and more annoying commute.  Source: I go to one of those high schools
School started 8am and we had an hour bus ride to school. I was one if the first stops so it meant getting up at 5am if I wanted to take my time or 530 if I wanted to rush. I'd have to get up earlier if it snowed overnight  The sun didn't even rise until we were almost to school.
So your school day was only 6 and a half hours? That’s a full hour shorter than mine
It also alegedly works for adults at work. 
When I was in college seven years ago, there were already studies in different cities that showed this same thing. If I recall correctly, those cities saw a significant decline in auto accidents during study period as well. We've been aware of the benefits of later high school start time for awhile now. I wish school districts would actually start implementing changes for the better of their students and their cities.
High School kids have sports and jobs after school.  Some districts stagger the start time of schools for school bus purposes.  These things are complicated.
Also the effect on after school sports. 
More of there is only so much time in a day and it's a balancing act. There are after school sports and program's, parent work days as well as possible younger siblings who may need to be watched. It's not just as simple as you seem to making it 
Went to school in North Seattle. I had zero period pe to make up for my language and music electives. Was at school by 530am and didn't leave until 4pm due to music and a dance club.  Never saw the sun during the winter. Now I gladly take my lunch break walk around the block. 
That sounds miserable. What state? And it was a rural town right?
High school for ne was 8 hours and some. Be there by 7am and leave around 3pm, get home around 330pm. I'd also walk the 2 miles home many days and I'd beat the bus full of kids by five minutes.
It does.  Wow what a shock, people aren’t happy or motivated when forced to sit at a desk for 8 hours a day
Maybe study hall and gym should be scheduled as the last and 2nd from last classes of the day so that kids taking band and sports can skip those last 2 classes.
After school sports shouldn't matter more than academic performance. 
My HS started at 9am and ended at 4:15.  After school sports generally ran 4:30-6ish.  It worked pretty well in our district.
That reminds me of my time working at a hydroelectric generation site. Go down 600ft elevator at 8am and up at 4pm and never see the sun for half the year. 
I’m a programmer and at my office they took away our table soccer for some reason . We didn’t know what to do during our breaks so people started taking less breaks which resulted in overall less work done, so after a couple of months they decided to put it back.
Study hall? Gym? My school didn't have these things.   You took gym once as a freshman and that was it.  Edit: we're pretty fat here in Kentucky. It's the fried chicken and lack of PE classes.
*laughs in American*.  I like how Europe does it. The pro teams manage their own youth system and the schools focus on their thing. Not like here where the public school system is co-opted into being a farm system for pro sports and ends up with these weird priorities.
No, fuck that. School isn't just about test scores. Sports, music, theater, and the countless other extra-curricular classes can be just as important. 
California required freshmen and sophmores to take p.e. to graduate. Study hall...never had it in my life. idk what it even is
"I actually [looked up the answer](https://qz.com/work/1189605/the-9-to-5-workday-isnt-just-hated-its-obsolete/) and got a bit depressed.  While there are some regions that still do 9-5, apparently 8-5 is the ""new normal."" Yet another way our generation is worse off than the previous generation."
Wow, I never thought Illinois would be stricter on anything education wise compared to California.   My high school required Gym all four years. It was a daily class just like science or math. You could get out of it senior year, though. If you were in band (I think) or got an academic waiver (wanting to take classes for graduation reasons)
It came from the fact that lunch used to be paid.
This could make traffic 10x worse if everybody's empty car is just wandering around
If you are going to be anywhere longer than it took to drive there, why wouldn't you just send the car home and program a pick up later?
It makes sense that cars would drop you off downtown and then retreat to suburbia, and you just have to better plan your pickup. Like Uber, you would look at how far away your car ended up to have free parking- such as going home- and then summon it at the appropriate time or even have it on a timer so it knows when to leave.  This would mean that street parking in urban areas wouldn’t be needed and could be opened up, and you could set up one way systems like many cities have that would reduce the load since the traffic could all continue on the same direction.  Over time, all of the pairing lots on the most expensive land around would be built on, increasing the density of the city,
I've been to quite a few small towns in my life, and I can't think of a single one where you couldn't find free parking. They might have meters on a couple of main streets,  sure,  but you can go a few blocks away and park for free...
"Wouldn't car owners simply ""tell"" their cars ""park somewhere where it's free, or if you can't then go cruising somewhere where you wouldn't cause a congestion because I hate congestions too""?"
The law of unintended consequences strikes yet again.
The only reason parking is a problem at all, and the only reason it's expensive, is that people want to park their cars close to where they're going. If you don't have to manually put the car it it's parking space and walk from there, there's no problem.   If everyone had self driving cars, they'd just drop you off and go park themselves anywhere. It's not like we lack space once you're freed from needing your car to be near you. Parking in a 2000 acre field 30 miles from the city center won't be more expensive than having your car drive itself around for 10 hours while you're at work.
I’m skeptical of 50 cents/hr estimate. Most employers pay mileage at about 50 cents *per kilometer*. Admittedly, this has other costs (initial purchase of car included), but this is an order of magnitude from that figure.
If actions as self driving cabs, your car could actually generate revenue for it's owners while cruising.  
But wont that hurt the environment? Added unnecessary emissions. Even if it’s electric cars most people’s power in the US comes from non-renewable sources.  
An urban planner in the bay area told me they're really counting on self driving cars to reduce the number of cars on the roads so an increasing population can continue to move on the same infrastructure. Now you're saying, self driving cars will increase the number of cars on the roads because there's no where for them to park
Yea I could see this being made illegal very quickly in my city of Chicago. Of course it won't matter at first when only a few people have self driving cars, but 50 years down or whenever that self driving cars are the norm, tens of thousands of cars will be circling downtown for the entire work day. The amount of traffic that would cause would be insanity.
When real estate costs more than keeping a whole donut of cars moving, this could actually be true. Systemically you'd only need an entrance/exit, and the cars would coordinate between themselves. When someone comes to check out a car, the donut rotates through until the correct car can exit. You wouldn't need to leave space for traversing through a parking garage.
"This is one of the reasons why I support the ""self driving cars as a service"" rather than most people having their own self driving car. You can get more people more places for cheaper by sending them to the next passenger rather than waiting for the same passenger to be ready. Another car will be available when they need it. It also largely defuses the park v cruise issue."
Can you imagine cars that just park in paid parking but leave when they sense a meter maid?
Not if the cars aren't owned by anyone and are networked together.
Or set it to car share mode so it goes off and acts as an autonomous taxi while you're in work to pay for them cruising maintenance and energy costs.  On second thought, why have a car and pay for up keep, when theirs all these cheap autonomous taxis rolling around?
Has to be at least twice as long, in that case
Surprised this isn't higher up. As someone who grew up in a small town, the idea that parking costs anything is absurd.
Yeah, the vast majority of small towns in America don't have a single meter. 
This. Also the economy of parking will change radically because the prime real estate (even in small towns) will no longer be used for parking lots. The least desirable land will be used and will be denser and more efficient because the cars will rearrange themselves as needed.  I doubt this river of endless cars will happen. 
Of a scenario like this stated to develop, then parking lots would be empty and respond by lowering prices
Assuming you work 5 days a week, have 4 weeks vacation time, that would put 14,400 miles on your car per year just getting to and from parking.
The US federal government gives 58 cents/mile for a personal vehicle driven for business use. No way in hell 50 cents/hour is accurate.
They wouldn't have to circle around while you're at work, they could just drive home and park, then come pick you up. There's also a possibility that car ownership would drop considerably at that point with zipcar like services and ridesharing becoming easier and cheaper.
Fifty years from now no one is going to own a vehicle.  You'll just summon a vehicle with your mind and the appropriate fare will be deducted from your account balance.
This is why Uber/Lyft/etc. are so big. It’s neat today, but it’s the future that is being planned.  Imagine if those cars circling were all ride share. They are no longer just waiting on their owner, they are working all day.   And that owner probably doesn’t own a car either, they use Uber too. 
You're describing a parking garage. If it's an area set aside for the cars whether they stop or not doesn't matter because  they're on somebody's land. Public roads work because you're not charged per use.
Meter maids could have lassos to round up the fleeing cars and give them tickets.  It’ll be like the old west all over again.
Funny to envision, but two problems with that: liability of the car maker and the technological effort of distinguishing the meter maid from others.
People use their cars like a backpack to hold their general stuff securely. Part of the problem with public transportation is that you don't get a movable box to hold all your stuff securely for the things you might do with your music and extra coat and different shoes and gym bag and bicycle on the back and sun glasses and if you are a family then so much more. Not to mention personal style. Having cars that are not owned by anyone will not solve this.
You might be on to something.   Maybe we could schedule them to pick up other people. Of course, we would have to make them bigger.   But then it would be unpredictable, so why not make them go on scheduled routes at specific times, so people could predict when they arrive...  IDK just throwing ideas out there and see what sticks
"Was just thinking this. Make sure you're there twice as long as a 1-way trip elsewise your car will send you a text complaining about how it just got home, and why you went if you weren't staying for long.      *""Why don't you see if your father can pick you up?""*"
I think people will still own cars. It’s a sense of identity for a lot of people and a way to show off their money. Especially here in Texas where I have neighbors who love their truck more than their children.
In the town I grew up in, you could have parked in the middle of the street and it might have been several hours before anybody had to drive around you.
So you're saying the system will eventually reach some sort of equilibrium? 
Yeah. Even assuming you live in an apartment building with no parking or whatever, at 50 cents an hour, the cost to cruise 24/7 would come out to ~$360/month, so all it would take is huge parking lots/garages on the outskirts of the city that charged $300/month or less for a spot, and it would prevent almost all of this.
Tragedy of the commons suggests that every one of them will be full of chewing gum and smell like vomit.
Fifty years from now humans will be subsistence farming in small, isolated communities.

Also teaching cars to feel love.  Edit: The grandparent post said 'love' instead of 'leave', but has been edited.
Car sells itself into transport prostitution to pay for its oil addiction, miserably transporting around random humans without a permit while its looked down upon by its better car brethren.  Then the car meets a nice semi who kindly points out that electric cars don't need oil changes, gets it back on the right path, until it gets adopted by a nice middle class soccer mom in suburbia.
I would gladly pay a monthly fee for a self driving uber/taxi for my commute to work. What's the point of owning it and it waiting for you if you only need it twice a day for a one way trip?
Don't even need to pay. Once you know a car's programmed route, you can just hop on the top and ride to your destination.  
Part of that is generational. Millenials are less likely to buy a car than boomers  But also I think part of the identity thing comes from driving it.  People are going to feel a lot less of an emotional connection to a car they cant actually drive.
No, the owners of the parking lots will find its cheaper to buy politicians to outlaw cruising.  That's how the market works.
$300,000 gross income for a parking deck.  Hmmmm  But then you gotta think, it wouldn't be cruising 24/7.  More like 9/5.  For about 20 days.  Soooo that would only be ~$90/month.  300,000 just turned into like 50,000-75,000 :(
Hmm, with a lot of people doing it, it's not really a great way to make money. So what if instead we all just contributed a small amount to crowdfund a series of these vehicles dedicated to transporting the public around? But for efficiency, they should probably be bigger than cars, like buses or something...

This. I drive a 5-speed Manual. I owned an automatic for 7 years and felt like I was just paying for a service with extra steps. I’m attached to my manual and will drive one until I can just sit in a car and watch a movie to get me places. No in between for me. I’m down for paying for a service.   Having a $20,000 severely depreciating asset to just sit in my front yard 90% of the time is a waste of money and extremely inefficient. I expect to pay a little more than a train ticket would cost, but SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than a cab service or UBER. Some people pay $700 a month for their cars just to sell it in 3 years to continue paying $700. Massive waste. 
It would free the space used for city parking for parks, new lanes or even new estate to build in. In a few decades we fill find it absurd that we used to reserve that amount of space just for cars to sit idle in the most valuable places. 
Those car storage areas could be much denser and smarter than current parking lots and parking garages, as well. Think about it: Currently they are designed for the lowest common denominator. Big, wide lanes and huge, roomy spots so that the world's worst driver can usually park their Canyonero in a spot, and still have room to swing all the doors open.  Design something like that in the future, and it could be more like an Automotive Automat. Narrow lifts, conveyors, and arms could pack the empty cars in like sardines. A normal sized garage of today could probably fit at least three to four times as many cars in the same space. Plus, they could be much taller without worry (or even partially underground, since there's no worries of killing people with roving clouds of carbon monoxide).
"""assuming you live in an apartment building with no parking or whatever""  the idea is you would never need to park your car, just charge and keep it on the move 24/7 if you live in a place with no parking"
For a lot of people, not often enough to own one. Especially in major cities 
they've already had those in korea/japan (not sure about china) for over a decade, it's super cool. you drive on to the big elevator at the ground floor, get out and walk away while your car gets taken up and packed in like a sardine completely autonomously.   for more efficient inventions, since most city housing is apartment based, there are also special moving trucks that park in the lot and extend a really long conveyor to your 10th floor window so you don't take a dozen trips up and down, your stuff just pops into the apartment

yeah when you have a market healthcare system with massive government subsidies and regulation that is what you get. The worst of both worlds.

The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here:   > The United States, on a per capita basis, spends much more on health care than other developed countries; the chief reason is not greater health care utilization, but higher prices, according to a study from a team led by a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health researcher.   Journal Reference:  It’s Still The Prices, Stupid: Why The US Spends So Much On Health Care, And A Tribute To Uwe Reinhardt  Gerard F. Anderson, Peter Hussey, and Varduhi Petrosyan  Health Affairs 2019 38:1, 87-95   Doi: https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05144  Link: https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05144  Abstract   A 2003 article titled “It’s the Prices, Stupid,” and coauthored by the three of us and the recently deceased Uwe Reinhardt found that the sizable differences in health spending between the US and other countries were explained mainly by health care prices. As a tribute to him, we used Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Health Statistics to update these analyses and review critiques of the original article. The conclusion that prices are the primary reason why the US spends more on health care than any other country remains valid, despite health policy reforms and health systems restructuring that have occurred in the US and other industrialized countries since the 2003 article’s publication. On key measures of health care resources per capita (hospital beds, physicians, and nurses), the US still provides significantly fewer resources compared to the OECD median country. Since the US is not consuming greater resources than other countries, the most logical factor is the higher prices paid in the US. Because the differential between what the public and private sectors pay for medical services has grown significantly in the past fifteen years, US policy makers should focus on prices in the private sector. 
American healthcare is performing and operating exactly as it was designed and intended. It's working, it's working well, and it's working properly.  *The American healthcare system was never designed for its patients.*  It is *critically important* to realize this whenever one discusses the state of health and medical care in the US. The first step *has* to be to shift the focus from making money to making people feel better. And GLWT in any practical/realistic sense given how much money the healthcare industry in the US turns each year.
Single provider (government) healthcare is the solution. The reason is that this single provider can meaningfully negotiate on prices, and will do so in order to save money when there is no profit motive.
Now the insurance companies just buy the hospitals in the US and pay them selves. 
As a Canadian working in the healthcare field in America. I'm getting paid approximately the same as I would in Canada (maybe slightly more due to the current CAD USD exchange).. its the insurances that are reaping the rewards here not your doctors! (for the most part.. please don't take me off your insurance panels oh mighty insurance corporations).
"1. Accidentally create a system in the 1950's that creates employer-funded insurance companies as an inextricable, costly middleman in the healthcare system  2. Spend taxpayer money to massively subsidize corn even though there's not really anything useful to do with it. Use this glut of corn to make high fructose corn syrup and pump it into everything you buy at the grocery store, creating a huge population of chronically ill patients suffering from diabetes and obesity-related conditions that require difficult surgery and expensive daily medications.  3. Have a ""sanctity of life"" culture that encourages people to spend vast fortunes keeping their dying relatives bedridden and unconscious, but technically alive, for months.  Congratulations! You have American healthcare. Insurance companies warp prices and leach money, our government actively spends money to create chronic illnesses that are expensive to treat, and everyone spends a fortune on pointless and painful end-of-life care. Of course it's expensive!"
This is not really news. At least, the public health guys at my med school have known this for a while. The real mystery is WHY the healthcare costs are so disparate between the United States and other nations. And the answer, which may surprise you, is more than likely not due to greed.  That is to say, public hospitals like state and federal hospitals, and other not-for-profits do not have high prices listed on their chargemaster because somebody somewhere is pocketing this cash en-masse. The highest paid people at these non-profit hospitals (which compose 80% of US hospitals) are specialist surgeons and diagnosticians, and their salary composes only about 10% of healthcare expenditure in the United States. Think about this, if you halve the salaries of all US physicians, your $40,000 bill will only go down by about $2000 to $38000. The vast majority of expenditure in the modern US healthcare system is due to the monstrosity of the hospital. Insurance companies aren’t pocketing this, because remember, we have not included them in this consideration. There are no shareholders pocketing it, and even though physicians are well compensated in the United States (equivalent to Canada and some European countries), most of your money isn’t going there.  So why the hell is it so much more expensive in the United States? Public health guys are having a hard time figuring out, but right now the large culprit is a massive conglomeration of inefficiencies. A large amount of funds are funneled to administration, in terms of handling the bureaucracies, paperwork, and negotiations of interacting with insurance companies—so when I said insurance companies are not responsible earlier, that was only MOSTLY true. Additionally, because of the highly litigious nature of healthcare in the United States, there is much more infrastructure involved in defending against lawsuits. Lots of what many people might consider unnecessary testing and imaging are performed because even though there is a high likelihood that what they’re testing for isn’t what’s going on, there’s still a 1% chance, for example, that they miss a critical, life-threatening diagnosis.   There’s also a cultural element: that is, in the United States, even when somebody is on the end of their ropes, for some reason people in this country have the mentality that “everything must be done to save my family member.” Even if those efforts prolong the suffering of the patient and cost of care enormously. How much do you think one ICU days cost? Now, how many days do you think it takes the average US citizen to decide “enough is enough, grandpa isn’t getting better” compared to European countries? As a comparison, in the UK, if you’re over 70, dialysis is straight-up refused if you’re in renal failure. This is almost certainly a death sentence. Whereas in the United States, we have an entire branch of Medicare that covers the cost so long as you paid your FICA.  There are quite a few additional measures, like improving the overall public health in the United States (obesity, heart disease, etc), limiting exposure to trauma-causing devices (ahem), which would likely improve healthcare costs. It is much more efficient in terms of length of life gained and cost of care to prevent a disease, than to try to cure it.   Axing insurance, setting wait-lists for elective procedures, improving public health measures, and after all this taking a heavy dissecting knife to the administrational inefficiencies BECAUSE of all the aforementioned reasons are the best ways of cutting out the fat of our healthcare costs.
This blows my mind. In Australia we spend half what the US spends and we all receive free health care. Greed is clearly the problem here. 
You really need a prescription for an inhaler? How would people abuse that?
"As someone who owns a pharmacy, the middleman is one of the biggest problems in America. For medical/hospital it is insurance, for pharmacies it is PBMs that keep promising cost savings to their clients, while they pay pharmacies less year after year, their profits go up, and those ""cost savings"" are never seen. Just look at Anthem suing Express Scripts, or even the city of Rockford, IL suing them. "
Maybe healthcare shouldn’t be a for-profit industry. Can you imagine if the police or fire department operated as a for-profit industry?
> The American healthcare system was never designed for its patients.  More specifically, when it comes to employer provided insurance the patient is not the client, the party that pays the insurance (the employer) is the client.  They are paying for you to show up for work in the morning, not keep you healthy.  
It also makes sure the most vulnerable have the same coverage as everyone else for most procedures. People who are already making much less working minimum wage jobs shouldn't have to worry about their employers not providing adequate health coverage just because their jobs aren't in demand. Leaving these people out to dry seems so foreign in Canada even though we do it with dental coverage (which is a debate currently happening).
I haven't seen any proof for the US subsidizing the rest of the world, at least nothing concrete.   However, it seems pretty obvious drug prices in the US are exceptionally high, most likely well beyond reason - well unless you're a medical company and you love a massive profit margin...
Not just insurance, hospital administration is getting a good share too.
That’s the difference between controlled medications and prescription medications. Prescription medications are meds that a layperson would not know when to use/would be too dangerous to use without the direction of a medical professional. Controlled meds are drugs that can be abused.
Albuterol is a stimulant. It's banned in WADA tested sports because of its performance enhancing properties.  It's also not habit forming, and not a controlled substance.  The real reason is because if someone has certain heart problems, the medication is dangerous. 
I live in the UK. Last time I visited the hospital, parking was all I paid for.   God bless the NHS. 
You could likely email the authors directly and recieve it free. 
Oh it's pretty obvious where some of the costs come from. Our prescription plan was bought out by Walgreens. Now we have to go to Walgreens and pay 20%. But if I go to Costco to get the same med at full price it's almost the same price as the 20% at Walgreens.  Vertical integration leads to price gouging. We pretend that Healthcare is a free market in the US, but it's more like a monopoly for many people. 
Fire departments used to be for profit and they would legit negotiate with you while your house burned down.  It’s honestly earily similar to how you negotiate while you’re sick, giving you absolutely no leverage.
Even for the people higher up the income brackets, not having your employment tied to your healthcare gives you massively more flexibility in seeking new positions and opportunities.  On more than one occasion I have forgone a possible job venture because the health benefits were lacking or non-existent...
There isn't really any evidence the US subsidises R&D. It's just one of those things redditors like to say to justify being price-gouged. New drugs, especially for less common diseases, are copyrighted for a good few years and are usually sold at a significant profit to the company. No company would sell at an R&D adjusted loss after all. This is disregarding the fact that a lot of drugs research is done in publicly funded labs. The R&D is mostly in the design stage rather than research.
"There also a lot more inhalers than just albuterol/salbutamol too.  Muscsrinic antagonists like Atrovent, commonly found in combination with albuterol, can cause urinary retention and increased occular pressures.  Beta agonists can cause myocardial ischemia and CNS side effects.  Inhaled steroids can cause thrush, certain ones can even increase risk of pneumonia in certain patient populations.  Some inhalers like Serevent even carry black box warnings, literally saying right on the box that ""This medication may increase your risk of death""  So, like you said, they can be dangerous. No medication is completely innocuous, and their use should be guided and managed by a medical professional, hence the prescription.  This doesn't even touch on the fact that some absurd amount of people, like damn near 75%, don't even know how to use their inhalers properly. I can only imagine how bad it would be if anyone could just buy them whenever/wherever. "
One of the great innovations of American Enterprise seems to be carving out defacto monopolies whilst pretending there's competition. Want internet? There's loads of internet companies! Only one that'll serve your area though. Want healthcare? There's tonnes of options! Only one you're allowed to use though! Want a  job? I've got great news! 90% of your small town in rural America is employed at the same place and they're the only place you can get a job!  But hey! It's not a *monopoly* because you could move away from your entire family just so you can change cable provider.
Because it's a medical device you put *on your cornea*, and improper contacts can result in an infection that could blind you.  That's why.
"**EDIT 5: For all the folks that have wanted to evaluate the material from the site, this is a [link to the University of Michigan Online Repository of Fossils (UMORF)](https://umorf.ummp.lsa.umich.edu/wp/), which contains publicly accessible 3D models of some of the specimens found at this site (as well as many other plants, inverts, and vertebrates housed at the University of Michigan). I hope that you all find it useful :)!**    &nbsp;   Paleontologist here,  I'd just like to say a few things based on the comments I'm seeing here:   &nbsp;  First off, my qualifications: My current advisor is the third author on this paper and I worked under (and collaborated with) the second author when I worked at the San Diego Natural History Museum (in fact, I re-prepared some of the material in this paper about 6 years ago). Furthermore, I am a doctoral student in the final months (hopefully) of my PhD. My dissertation work has been on proboscideans (elephants and their relatives), but I have also done a fair amount of work on cetaceans (whales) and other vertebrates.  &nbsp;  As far as the dating methods go, this site was dated using multiple types of absolute dating methods, which all resulted in a very similar age. However, the Uranium-series dating (not to be confused with radiocarbon dating, which could not give you an accurate age this old) that was used here got results with a *very* high confidence. In fact there is essentially no evidence of alteration that might lead to an older date (which really would not be common anyways). The dates recovered are almost unimpeachable (and I don't say that lightly). I would be very surprised if a geochronologist or any other expert had a major problems with the dates themselves (in fact a geochronologist was a reviewer for this paper for just this reason). Also, to the people that are saying that it is perhaps time to reassess our methods of isotopic dating in general, I strongly suggest you spend more time researching and trying to understand these methods before you make a claim like this...  &nbsp;  One other misconception that I keep seeing here are peoples' interpretation of what is meant by ""human"" in this paper. ""Human"" is meant here in the sense of a species of the genus *Homo*, not necessarily *Homo sapiens* specifically. In fact, because of the old age it seems fairly unlikely that this would be the modern species of human rather than some other [unknown] species.  &nbsp;  I'm sure there will be other questions or comments here throughout the next day or so, and I will try to check in from time to time and update this post. I'm also happy to answer any questions that I can (to the best of my knowledge).  &nbsp;  Hope this is at least somewhat helpful!  &nbsp;  Edit 1: To the folks wondering if this site could have been scavenged by humans (as opposed to hunted), I would say that, that is absolutely possible. In fact there is really no evidence one way or another to argue for hunting over scavenging at this site, and I don't believe that this paper takes a stance on this either. In fact, I would say that the argument of hunting vs scavenging in association with this mastodon is somewhat irrelevant. What is important is that this extremely old site (relatively speaking, anyways) has fairly clear association with ancient human activity.   &nbsp;  Edit 2: Several people have pointed out that the article discusses a lack of evidence of meat stripping on the specimen. This does suggest scavenging, as it likely means the soft tissue was at least somewhat rotted and not usable.   &nbsp;  Edit 3: Many people are suggesting that this animal could have been scavenged or had its bones modified many thousands of years after its death (i.e., implying the tools are much younger than the mastodon). To that point 1) the type of breakage seen on these bones is indicative of damage while the bone was still fresh. Fresh bone (sometimes called ""green bone"") breaks in a very different ""spiral pattern"" than older dried out bone; and 2) you have to remember that the sediments that the tools and mastodon are found in represent the context in which they were buried. Therefore since these materials were all found within the same layer they must have been buried at the same time. It is possible that ancient humans exhumed old bones (though I know of no actual evidence of this), **but** we would see telltale signs of disturbance to the sediment (which was not observed here).    In other words, I don't think that arguments about this site will come down to whether the material is associated and coeval, but whether folks think that these artifacts are indeed stone tools. Those people who do not agree with this identification will then have to reconcile the crazy taphonomy at this site and attribute it to some other natural process (which will be no small feat, IMHO).  &nbsp;  Edit 4: For the people asking why we don't have any evidence of humans (or human remains) in North America in the time between the age of this site and more generally accepted dates:   First off, I would just like to note that we are almost certainly not talking about a direct lineage of humans between the time of this site and those of Clovis times (in fact, as I've stated above, we are likely not even talking about the same species). This was likely a very small population of humans that made it to North America that probably died out long before the modern species of human ever made it over. In that sense, there isn't necessarily a gap of time to ""bridge"".   As for why potential sites might not be preserved: There are a couple of reasons that you might not have evidence of humans found from this time. First off, you may not have rocks of the right age readily exposed in the region where the individuals were living (which is somewhat the case on the west coast, as far as I am aware). Second, the individuals could be living in an environment that is not conducive to preserving fossils (e.g., organisms that live in montane environments tend to not preserve in the fossil record because sediments are not being deposited in those regions). Third, getting preserved in the fossil record (in general) is very rare, and if your study organism has a very small population size or is short lived (as we would expect in the case here) then you have a very very low probability of being preserved (let alone found and collected). Finally, even if these scenarios aren't the case, there is the possibility that scientists have just been looking in the wrong strata, region, or age."
The [full research article](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v544/n7651/full/nature22065.html) was published in the journal *Nature*.  **Abstract** The earliest dispersal of humans into North America is a contentious subject, and proposed early sites are required to meet the following criteria for acceptance: (1) archaeological evidence is found in a clearly defined and undisturbed geologic context; (2) age is determined by reliable radiometric dating; (3) multiple lines of evidence from interdisciplinary studies provide consistent results; and (4) unquestionable artefacts are found in primary context1, 2. Here we describe the Cerutti Mastodon (CM) site, an archaeological site from the early late Pleistocene epoch, where in situ hammerstones and stone anvils occur in spatio-temporal association with fragmentary remains of a single mastodon (Mammut americanum). The CM site contains spiral-fractured bone and molar fragments, indicating that breakage occured while fresh. Several of these fragments also preserve evidence of percussion. The occurrence and distribution of bone, molar and stone refits suggest that breakage occurred at the site of burial. Five large cobbles (hammerstones and anvils) in the CM bone bed display use-wear and impact marks, and are hydraulically anomalous relative to the low-energy context of the enclosing sandy silt stratum. 230Th/U radiometric analysis of multiple bone specimens using diffusion–adsorption–decay dating models indicates a burial date of 130.7 ± 9.4 thousand years ago. These findings confirm the presence of an unidentified species of Homo at the CM site during the last interglacial period (MIS 5e; early late Pleistocene), indicating that humans with manual dexterity and the experiential knowledge to use hammerstones and anvils processed mastodon limb bones for marrow extraction and/or raw material for tool production. Systematic proboscidean bone reduction, evident at the CM site, fits within a broader pattern of Palaeolithic bone percussion technology in Africa3, 4, 5, 6, Eurasia7, 8, 9 and North America10, 11, 12. The CM site is, to our knowledge, the oldest in situ, well-documented archaeological site in North America and, as such, substantially revises the timing of arrival of Homo into the Americas.
I guess that might mean humans got there way earlier but it was the later arrivals who survived to the modern days, because isn't that what the genetics says?
Here's two videos where they go into detail about the work. One buy Nature, including 3D renderings where they piece together stones and bone found on the site: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyfSsgCrjb0, and one by the San Diego Natural History Museum where they go into detail about the site, and other possible mechanisms to explain the stone and bone patterns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVeOoWmUnLw 
1) I totally believe it.  Ice Ages are cyclical, so if an ice age contributed to a land bridge crossing, humanity had multiple opportunities to cross over the millenia.  I think it's far more likely that conservative academia has frozen out evidence of pre-clovis culture.    2)Dire wolves were a real thing?!
How do they know it was butchered by humans, specifically? 
Intriguing. Does this one site prove that Homo was in American 115,000+- years earlier than we thought? Possibly. That is the great thing about science - it is always ready to examine new evidence that might disprove the current theory. We don't need to take sides and then dig in our feet and defend the side we have chosen. Let's just keep examining the evidence and therein will lie the truth.
Well, this is sort of true, but Holen (the Holens, really) are actually experts on the interpretation of broken mammoth/mastodon bones as being caused by humans.  They have promoted a number of dubious sites on the Plains in which their assessment of breakage pattern is the *only* archaeological evidence.  Hence, the breakage patterns had better be extremely distinctive indeed, and the asseesment be replicable by others, which, well, in the California case, not really.  See [Kenady et al on the Ayer Pond](https://qmackie.com/2010/04/24/orcas-bison/) bison remains for an example of what an old site with unarguable human agency and no stone tools looks like.
Gonna piggyback for people who just read the title. The butchers were not necessarily Homo sapiens, but another species within our genus. This is not made clear in the title, and downplayed in the NBC article. Here's the peer-reviewed article, since this is a science sub after all...  https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v544/n7651/full/nature22065.html  Still very cool.
Genius lies in that mix of narrowness of scope and depth of knowledge. We need geniuses of all stripes to make the world go round.
I'm a bioanthropologist and everyone in my department are talking about this. I agree on the dating. It looks very secure. So that leaves us with a debate about the lithics  (are the stone tools really tools) and the taphonomy (do the bones really reflect human butchery).   As to which species this is I think Homo erectus is pretty plausible, as we know they were able to get to Indonesian islands that were only accessible by boat or raft. I think the Denisovans are plausible too. We know that the ancestors of today's Polynesians had Denisovan relatives, so maybe they were seafaring in the area back then.   Right now I think the least likely candidate if the dating is accurate is modern humans. If they made it to America that early then where are all the sites between the Pacific Coast and Africa? I mean we don't have humans in Australia until 60k at the very earliest. At least we know that humans were boating by then, but this would double the date of the oldest seafaring/rafting. The dating suggests an interglacial period, so the only way to get there from the old world includes some open water travel.
"Basically, yes.  As u/jeladli says,  > One other misconception that I keep seeing here are peoples' interpretation of what is meant by ""human"" in this paper. ""Human"" is meant here in the sense of a species of the genus Homo, not necessarily Homo sapiens specifically. In fact, because of the old age it seems fairly unlikely that this would be the modern species of human rather than some other [unknown] species.  So, from what I gather, it doesn't seem like we're exactly going to have to reevaluate the whole of our history as we know it or anything like that."
Head on down to LA and you can visit a really neat little museum at [La Brea Tar Pits](https://tarpits.org/) and see dozens of Dire Wolf skeletons! They literally have a room with [over 400 skulls of em on the walls.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Dire_Wolf_Skulls_La_Brea_2005-08-01.JPG) Just can't stop pulling them out of the ground/tar there.
The mammoth bones were broken while fresh. Hammer tools were found near the body. They weren't chewed apart, as if by an animal, they were smashed apart by something with enough dexterity to use a tool. So something was likely using tools to masicate the mammoth 130,000 years ago.
Just a quick point that hunter/gathering societies have much more spare time than really any other society. It should only entail something like 2-4 hours of work a day. So it's often misunderstood why survival is a bigger struggle when you're living like that.   It's a more fragile way of life, less control of the future but it's in a way an easier life. 
"I think unique specialized knowledge and study is neat, but it can come with some draw-backs:   - The ""Hammer-Nail"" conundrum:  ""Everything"" starts looking like your field of specialty.  As a primary care MD, I see a lot of specialist mistakenly funnel diagnoses into their field.  (a not great example: Chest pain to G.I. specialist is Heartburn >> cardiac)    - Lack of verification by other specialist in the field.  Putting *too much* faith into one or two people's assessment.  (a corollary example might be the vaccine debate: 1 flawed, confessed falsified study on vaccines => Millions in U.S. SURE vaccines cause autism)  - Lack of ~~cohobate~~ corroborating evidence *not* in said specific field.  (what the hell word did I spell there initially?)  Still, the finding would be neat if true.  "
I like this.   One of humanities greatest achievements was the ability to specialise and share the fruits of that specialisation. Whether it was learning how to create fire, to hunting techniques, to archaeological knowledge on human interference with the bones of an extinct mammal, specialisation has allowed us to create the world we live in to today.  Despite all the suffering and misery, it is amazing what humans have achieved at times.  Let's keep specialising and sharing. We might reach world peace on day.  Did not intend this to go all hippy. Oops. 
Wait, does this imply that Homo Erectus migrated to the Americas? From what I understand (Bio Anthro 101) the Homo Erectus never made it further east than China. 
"Is the question ""where are all the other sites?"" even a legitimate line of inquiry at this point? The likelihood of archaeological evidence surviving for 130,000 is zero (with a margin of error). We have a site now, at least potentially. One site of that age, with this level of description, is a rare event.   "
Yes, that is absolutely accurate. If the animal was only used for marrow processing, then that definitely points to scavenging. Good catch!
> Are we talking about a potential re-definition of the genus homo if this is verified?  No, since the earliest example of the *Homo* genus date back nearly three million years, and the oldest known *H. sapiens* remains are from 200ka.  What it *will* do, however, is massively disorder the current accepted dating for human habitation of the Americas, since this site is older than the current accepted figure by a *full order of magnitude*. And it's for precisely that reason that more data will be needed before any pronouncement can be made.
From OP:  > **The mammoth bones were broken while fresh.** Hammer tools were found near the body. They weren't chewed apart, as if by an animal, they were smashed apart by something with enough dexterity to use a tool. So something was likely using tools to masicate the mammoth 130,000 years ago.  And /u/jeladli:  > Paleontologist here,  > **Yes, it would almost certainly be evident if these bones had been previously exhumed by early humans.** You have to remember that the rocks that these specimens are found in are the context in which the animal was buried. In that sense, if the sediment around the animal had been disturbed (which would be necessary in your hypothetical scenario) then there would have been evidence of that in the field. Of course, there is always a chance that the authors missed this in the field, but I will tell you that most of the people that are involved with this study are extremely good (i.e., anal-retentive) stratigraphers.  > Also see /u/brojangles comment on breakage. Fresh bone breaks very differently than older bone.
"Is the implication here that this much earlier settlement of ""humans"" in the Americas just died out before a later wave of modern humans established themselves successfully?  Edit: clarifying the use of ""humans"" as unspecific hominid relative as mentioned in the parent comment, since a couple of replies seemed uncertain that I was clear on that point"
>Hammer tools were found near the body.   The article is far from clear about this. It says that they found rocks nearby that could have been used as hammers, which is very different from saying they actually found hammers.
We don't currently have evidence on it- that doesn't mean it never happened. Archaeology and paleonathropology are full of missing information simply because so much has rotted or away or we just haven't found evidence for it. 130kya is a revolutionary dating for evidence of hominids in the Americas, but it could be  possible. 
I always thought Sapiens were the only ones that made it to the Americas! That's what I learned in college ~6 years ago. Is there any other evidence besides this site pointing to others coming to America before Sapiens?
Not qualified in any way, but it immediately made me think of the [Calico Early Man Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Early_Man_Site) which is not all that far to the North East of this site, which had a stone ring dated to about 135,000 years ago.  I think the artifacts there are generally poo-poo'ed (technical term) since they just don't make sense, but given this, perhaps they aren't that strange after all?  EDIT: Also, the Calico site was excavated by Louis Leakey, so not like it's a nobody.
There is no evidence for monkeys in North America during the time period we're talking about here.    North America *had* monkeys, 30-some million years ago but an extinction event killed them all off.  Some survived in South America, where they've done quite well for themselves.  They were cut off from coming north because until ~3 million years ago panama was underwater.  In the time period between 30 million and 3 million years ago the monkeys of South America adapted themselves to a tropical, arboreal lifestyle.  So even after the land bridge has been back there has been no driving need to set off into new environments where their specializations would become disadvantages.   
Not as different as you are implying.  They are respected in their fields and making a statement in a respected journal, I'm sure the statement wasn't included lightly.  Saying it with a certainty would be irresponsible. Including the statement has significance. 
Paleontologist here,  Yes, it would almost certainly be evident if these bones had been previously exhumed by early humans. You have to remember that the rocks that these specimens are found in are the context in which the animal was buried. In that sense, if the sediment around the animal had been disturbed (which would be necessary in your hypothetical scenario) then there would have been evidence of that in the field. Of course, there is always a chance that the authors missed this in the field, but I will tell you that most of the people that are involved with this study are *extremely* good (i.e., anal-retentive) stratigraphers.  Also see /u/brojangles comment on breakage. Fresh bobe breaks very differently than older bone.
I remember Bill Bryson saying in one of his books that finding bones is considered very lucky. I think he said that maybe 7000 humans (or the equivalent of that many bones) would fossilize and it would be pretty much spread over the entire globe. And that's from 7 billion humans. It is almost fantastically lucky to find a bone from any of our cousin's, because they were quite few. Like, all the bones that have been found could fit on a pickup truck if you didn't mind jumbling it up.  Also implies that maybe there have been far greater beasts than what we know of today, but we'll never know cause they died in the wrong places.   He also talks about how the animals we have the most fossils of is a old crab thing which i cant remember the name of. It's a animal with 3 pieces, a tail, body and a head. Literally thousands of them in museums worldwide, but that's because they were millions upon millions over millions of years.   
That's why this find is a big deal.
yeah that's why he's asking...
Because...  > The likelihood of archaeological evidence surviving for 130,000 is zero (with a margin of error).   A site surviving for 130, 000 years, keeping as much evidence as possible around and intact is RARE. There has been 3 major glaciation periods over that length of time so the fact that they found this at all is incredible.
Just a quick clarification on the no-monkeys point: North America had primates (non-anthropoid adapiformes and omomyiformes) during the Eocene, roughly ~56 to ~34 mya. So far, there's no evidence of them in South America. During the early through middle Eocene, North America was much warmer and wetter; but after the early Eocene climatic optima there was gradual cooling, drying and increased seasonality to the climate, driving the extinction of these primates. These primates did not give rise to South American monkeys (although this hypothesis had been previously argued, it's been ruled out by genetic and fossil evidence).   South American monkeys (platyrrhines) likely rafted from Africa, with fossil evidence in South America dating to the Oligocene. 
Trilobite?
What do you mean when you say the monkeys rafted?  Apologies in advance for my ignorance.
Yes! I only remember my native name for them. And it does not translate well.
A massive flood or tsunami happens. A forest gets leveled. It and all of the creatures in it get swept out to sea. A few live.
That is a very hardcore definition of rafting. I was picturing something much more whimsical. 
One of the textbooks (Boyd & Silk) I use for some intro bioanth classes provides [this lovely reconstruction](https://i.imgur.com/nHFgMZ4.png).
In terms of impact on climate change, methane causes about 25 times more warming over a 100 year period than carbon dioxide.  Insofar as this is bad for climate change reasons, this can help put in context *how* bad.
We don’t even actively measure methane on sources that are prone to emit it!!!  Source: I do emissions testing for EPA
Hmmm, according to models and data the earth is warming quicker than anticipated. What could be wrong with our model?
As someone who has been involved in exposing industrial and agricultural pollution for decades I have to say that I am not at all suprised. The EPA has little to do with protecting the environment and industry cannot ever be trusted to report their emissions honestly.  Oil exploration/drilling also releases uncountable volumes of Methane. Hopefully with better monitoring techniques those people who still don't understand how noxious petrochemicals are start to understand.
>Using a Google Street View car equipped with a high-precision methane sensor, the researchers discovered that methane emissions from ammonia fertilizer plants were 100 times higher than the fertilizer industry’s self-reported estimate.  This is why we can't trust corporations to self-report anything.
I'm just a chemical engineer here. But shouldn't the sensor be in the stack instead of the street?
The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first two paragraphs of the linked academic press release here:   > Industrial methane emissions are 100 times higher than reported, researchers say   > Emissions of methane from the industrial sector have been vastly underestimated, researchers from Cornell and Environmental Defense Fund have found.   > Using a Google Street View car equipped with a high-precision methane sensor, the researchers discovered that methane emissions from ammonia fertilizer plants were 100 times higher than the fertilizer industry’s self-reported estimate. They also were substantially higher than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimate for all industrial processes in the United States.

Estimation of methane emissions from the U.S. ammonia fertilizer industry using a mobile sensing approach.   Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene, 7(1), p.19.   Link: https://www.elementascience.org/article/10.1525/elementa.358/  DOI: http://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.358  Abstract  To date, estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the natural gas (NG) value chain have focused on upstream (production) and midstream (gathering, transmission, and storage) operations. In this study, we estimate methane emissions from an important downstream consumer of NG, the ammonia fertilizer industry, which commonly uses NG as a feedstock and a fuel for the production of ammonia and other upgraded products. Using a Google Street View (GSV) car equipped with a high-precision methane analyzer, we adopted a mobile sensing approach to measure methane mixing ratios along public roads that are downwind of the ammonia fertilizer plants. Useful data were collected from six plants, which represent >25% of the total number of U.S NG-based ammonia fertilizer plants, and use >20% of the total NG consumption by this industry. Based on the measured data, a source characterization model was applied to estimate the methane emission rates from the upwind plants. Assuming that the estimates are representative of emissions during normal operations of a plant, we calculated the NG loss rate (i.e. the ratio between NG emission rate and NG throughput). If the sampled plants are representative of the U.S. ammonia fertilizer industry, the industrial-averaged NG loss rate (± standard deviation) is estimated to be 0.34% (±0.20%), and the total methane emissions (± standard deviation) from this industry are estimated to be 29 (±18) Gigagram per year (Gg CH4/yr) in 2015–2016. This is significantly higher than the reported methane emissions of 0.2 Gg CH4/yr from the U.S. EPA’s Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gas Tools (FLIGHT). This study begins to fill an important knowledge gap in quantifying methane emissions along the NG value chain, and demonstrates the capability of mobile sensing for characterizing airborne emissions.
I can’t believe it. Those big companies lied to us. If we can’t trust them, who can we trust?
And this is happening in the US. Imagine countries like China or India?
I like how all these plastic bag ban, ban plastic straws. Every news outlet shout climate change. Companies pr dept day we are going green environmental activism. All lies. Consumers get fucked companies pollute like normal. Politics are back to shouting and nothing is down. What a joke. Our leadership is filled by the American oligarchy
Welp if companies don't like regulations, i guess they should have acted properly in the first place 🤷🤷🤷
> In terms of impact on climate change, methane causes about 25 times more warming over a 100 year period than carbon dioxide.  in the article it says  > “In a 20-year timeframe, methane’s global warming potential is 84 times that of carbon dioxide.”
Yup, this also aligns with old school climate science, Algore style. In a few words, climate change is a cascading failure of ecosystem, which essentially means once it begins it snowballs & the rate of change increases exponentially. This is what we have been seeing in recent years, pretty much exactly what environmental scientists said in the 90s.  However, whilst many of aforementioned old school scientists changed their tune to the modern though process that CO2 levels can still be cut, others have adopted the more controversial view, that, climate change will happen, whether human caused or not, any changes made now are too little to late. The solution they offer is one of survival, investing in robust supply lines & power grids, and resilient food sources.
I recall statements in previous reports, theorizing that we have 12 years to change course before the effects of climate change are catastrophic and irreversible.  If these reports were based on such significant underestimations...what does that mean for this timeline?  Is it already too late?
Whyyyyyy??
>I do emissions testing for the EPA  Surprised you still have a job considering this administrations stance on climate change and industry regulation.
  I've been stack testing for years. Stack testers don't work for the EPA (In PA), but our findings and reports are are sent to them. We often get observed, and have to follow all EPA testing guidelines  (For those curious, officially called EPA reference methods).  What state are you In? I'm not aware of any state conducting their own stack testing. Reviewing protocols and reports yes, not the actual testing.
Industries creating greenhouse gasses are outright lying about how much they are making because they know the damage it does and don't want to be forced to respond.
Basically every study done since we started studying it has made predictions less severe than what we're actually seeing. That's the really terrifying part.
This is what terrifies me. This article only mentions the fertilizer industry. I am positive the Oil and Gas industry is just as bad or worse.
After watching Chernobyl, bet they used the instrument that maxed at 3.6 Roentgen
I’m pretty sure the people who own the stack would disagree.
“Self-reported estimate”  Hashtag surprise
Bigger companies
Well, it's a good thing God broke up Pangaea and dragged both of those countries outside the environment.
This was not Google's idea. The researchers had the idea and asked Google if they could use one of their vehicles for it.  They looked at 6 facilities and scaled the findings to the whole US.
Correct. They last for different amounts of time in the atmosphere.  The 5-year impact of methane is about 100x that of carbon dioxide, 20-year is 70-80x, and 100-year is 20-25x, so it is very intense in the short term but falls off long-term.
After about 10-20 years methane is photooxidized to CO2, which is still a greenhouse gas
Every bit of emissions we can cut helps. We are already guaranteed another 2°C of warming, but we have the choice of how much additional warming we are willing to deal with above that. It’s not an all or nothing deal.
In all likelihood yes. Even not considering this underestimation, science tends to estimate on the conservative side. That means conservative estimates for all their calculations, and since the climate is a natural feedback loop, it's an even worse underestimation.
We've known about the cattle farming for a while, but this is saying is that the EPA has been underestimating the amount of methane emitted by fertilizer plants by a factor of 100.
It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.  Upton Sinclair
Not how it works.   Stack testers are 3rd party companies hired on by industries that have to meet permit requirements for their sources through state and federal regulations. Anyone with an air permit has to stack test, period. They pay us, we give the good or bad news. EPA/DEP can call the shots on both our testing and reports.
"I have to jump in. Western companies, American companies would be forced to comply with the necessary regulations and changes needed. Africa and Asia would totally laugh and smile and say to each other ""now we can catch up""  This has to stop or we're all dead. ELE dead. Millions of years to rebuild the diversity of species we've recklessly exterminated."
That's not really true, seeing as we've had predictions that certain islands and cities would be partly underwater by now
Worse. In Canada our biggest villain is Tar Sands, in the US it is shale-gas which is especially bad.   https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/oilsands-carbon-emissions-study-1.5106809  https://thetyee.ca/News/2017/04/27/Canada-Methane-Leakage-Under-Reported/  https://www.eeb.cornell.edu/howarth/publications/f_EECT-61539-perspectives-on-air-emissions-of-methane-and-climatic-warmin_100815_27470.pdf (**pdf**)
Not great, but not terrible.
And then would probably just move the stack to a country without sensors if it was enforced.  Welcome to the global economy!
For those like me who didn't know, GWP is global warming potential - it measure how much  heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere up to a specific time  horizon, relative to carbon dioxide.
I think the main issue is that the warming that has already happened is causing other processes to kick in and warm things up even more. The permafrost is thawing, releasing methane, the icecaps are shrinking, decreasing the amount of sun that is reflected back into space, increased forest fires are releasing more carbon, etc. If we cut carbon emissions back to natural levels, those, processes would still be going on, hence why some scientists are saying it's too late now.
No. They just aren’t paid for by us.   Somehow, people in this country seem to think votes = money and it doesn’t. Their employers, the people that actually pay them and give them jobs when leave public office, are the ones that give them orders.   The ONLY way you actually change our democracy is to change campaign finance and lobbying. What we call corruption in other countries, they call lobbying here.
"> Africa and Asia would totally laugh and smile and say to each other ""now we can catch up""  To play Devils Advocate for a moment, they do kinda have a point, if ""first world nation"" status can only be achieved through destructive exploitation, it is arguably base hypocrisy to deny developing nations the same ""right.""  Scientific objectivity says it was never anyone's right, and that first world nations were wrong to do so in the first place, but that's unfortunately not a compelling enough argument."
"As someone who lives in New Orleans... we're one bad storm away from never recovering. That storm, is also not too far away. We keep getting ""Once in a hundred years"" weather on a somewhat regular basis."
We need global climate protections. The UN needs to spearhead global regulations and enforce them.
"Self-reporting in action. De-regulation and reduction of enforcement of regulations is pushed by corporate stooges with the classic ""they'll be completely honest in their self-reporting! No need to enforce and confirm regulatory requirements!"". It's a shame that corporations are harming future generations to increase their quarterly profits.  Sad* to say, humanity might have late stage capitalism."
And the reason the number goes down with time is because methane (CH4) slowly break down in the atmosphere
While I agree completely, if we want to un-ruin the earth in time to avoid extinction. Everyone has to be on the same page. It was wrong for first world nations to get ahead this way, and developing nations totally have a point. But it’s looking like we as a planet don’t have time to work through that aspect right now. Everyone everywhere needs to be stepping up, or we could pass the threshold into unfixable before we know it. For all our sakes. But we can’t honestly ask nations on the rise to cut back even though we didn’t. If we literally STILL aren’t. We as a world leader (American POV here) have to lead the way and take the first step or other countries never will. Even if it hurts us economically/geo-politically. IMO it’s shameful that our companies are lying about the difference they are making instead of actually trying to make one. We can’t put our greed before the good of the world, the free open market solutions of capitalism won’t help solve this problem. Especially if consumers are being told they are supporting greener companies but actually aren’t
New Orleans has been below sea level for its entire existence.
I agree, but a lot of the 'heavy hitters' in the UN are the biggest producers of climate changing emissions.  I'm not usually a pessimist, and I hope I'm wrong saying this...  But I am beginning to think it's going to take 'apocalyptic' changes in parts of the world before things change. And by then, it will be too late.
The internet told me this:  As methane rises into the air, it reacts with the hydroxyl radical to create water vapor and carbon dioxide. The lifespan of methane in the atmosphere was estimated at 9.6 years as of 2001; however, increasing emissions of methane over time reduce the concentration of the hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere.  This suggests that, as the volume of methane increases the lifespan of methane also increases.
He's saying you'd be better off lubing up that ass and taking it, rather than taking it raw.
and..... the sea level is getting higher. Meaning lower and lower high points are needed to flood it.
I doubt /u/VapesOutForKingJames was involved in that decision
Oh that's nice, so it's exponential growth.
What a douchebag
Yep. Also the frozen tundra traps a lot of methane and it gets released faster as climate change takes hold in those regions....so another exponential factor
I think it's over. I think this system will runaway from us unless we decide to perform some risky geoengineering.
Welcome to twelve years ago!
Yep we were at that point a decade ago. Now? Fucked.
Previous research by Dr. Kiley Hamlin at the University of British Columbia has shown that [infants want to punish puppets whom they perceive to have done unfair acts](https://psych.ubc.ca/lab-of-the-month-infants-and-moral-development-with-dr-kiley-hamlin/).
Does anybody have the sample size? I can't access their paper without signing up
I feel that people are better off understanding kids when they treat them as inexperienced adults rather than undeveloped children.
"I remember, as a child, feeling like my thoughts and ideas were undervalued and easily dismissed by adults. Granted, I was naive as hell, but I was able to process and learn pretty quickly, and was far more ""aware"" than I think people gave me credit for.  Point being, I believe that many kids are a hell of lot smarter that we may assume."
"I don't understand why people treat them any other way. Did people lose all hints of memory from then?  Adults talking down to kids always did and still does irritate me. Sometimes there's a lot of information involved and you have to build on it but there's no reason to be dismissive. If the kid doesn't get it immediately then a good explanation could still be useful years down the road when a few more pieces have shown up. For years I asked my parents what the gearshift on cars was for and they deflected. Then it was finally time for me to learn to drive and they haltingly tried to explain it to me before I finally said ""Oh, like gears on a bike. Of course, that makes sense. Why didn't you say so earlier?"""
"I struggled as a kid because I really had a hard time with this. To me, I felt like adults didn't have any respect for me or my peers and I would become uncooperative because I didn't have a lot of tolerance for it. My ""teachers"" at the time took it as me having poor ""citizenship"" as in, I didn't get along with others but I just didn't get along with the teacher(we were actually graded on that up to 5th grade).   The few teachers that actually treated me like an adult and spoke to me as if I had some shred of intelligence in my head are who's classes I excelled at. It became about learning and not establishing dominance over the students."
Kids are insanely smart if they're interested in something.  I've met some fifth graders who were interested in space science whom I could have a decent conversation with, and I'm an adult.  They don't know as much as I do, but they can sure figure it out if you draw the right kind of picture.  When I was their age, my favorite adults were the ones who would put up with me rambling on about black holes and neutron stars and stuff.  I imagine they feel the same way.  I wish I could recapture that pure, concentrated joy of learning I got when curling up with some pillows and a pile of late 80s Scientific Americans (thanks Mom and Dad for saving those).  Being a kid was awesome in some ways.  I love the resources I have access to now, but I still want to be that kid with the magazines.
Whats really amazing to me is that these earth sized worlds are so close to each other, and three of them are in the habitable zone. If life exists there, their sky must have one hell of an awesome view.
Here are some details from NASA's conference:  1) Spitzer detects 7 earth size planets around the TRAPPIST-1 Star System  2) 40 light years away  3) 3 planets are in the right zone for liquid water  4) Have measured the masses and radi of earth-size planets  5) Can look at atmosphere and bio-signatures  6)  Planets are close to each other, you would see them similarly as you would see Earth’s moon.  7)  Planets are so close, they interact gravitationally on each other.  8) Trappist-1e is very close in size to earth.  It receives a similar amount of light as Earth does.  9) Trappist-1f (MIGHT) be water-rich and similar in size as earth (NASA just said currently no detection of water).  Receives about as much light as Mars.  10)Trappist-1g is largest in the system, 13% larger radius than Earth.  Receives about as much light as Mars and the Asteroid belt.  
And rough atmospheric composition data is expected in 5-10 years ... that is just amazing!
Here's a [link to the study](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature21360)
Neat! And as long as NASA's budget doesn't get cut, well have the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope) launched in 2018. My understanding is that these planets are close enough that the JWST should let us know the composition of any atmospheres. 
What a cool system. Even if they do not harbor life (and my prior probability for any one of those harboring life is low), this is a ridiculously awesome find. 
How does an ultracool dwarf star provide enough heat for these planets to sustain life? Is the star still warm enough to radiate proper energy?
Just think of what we haven't discovered yet.
"Why is the star called Trappist-1? Was it named before this research? Does it have a name like ""Alpha Centauri""?"
Some facts about the star:  * It's an M-dwarf, M8V to be specific. * Incredibly late main sequence, so it will live a long time. * It's moving quite fast, and is probably young. * There are no stellar or brown dwarf companions, a research effort [I actually worked on myself](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-ref?bibcode=2016ApJ...829L...2H). * It's ~12.2 parsecs, or 40 light years, or 235 trillion miles away---this is *really* close to us, in the grand scheme of things. * There is a good chance that the planets will be tidally locked, as they're all quite close to the host star. Even if this is true, atmospheric convection (among other things) could still easily allow life to form on the surface.  It's an incredible discovery that is entirely unprecedented. I can't wait for the JWST data in 2018, which will tell us more about potential biomarkers in the planetary atmospheres. 
Pending further analysis of the planets' atmospheres, I imagine this system will be an excellent candidate for us to point our most powerful radio telescopes at and broadcast a modern-day [Arecibo message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message).
I'm sure they'd think the same about our nearly unobstructed view of the cosmos as night. 
[NASA's rendering](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/1_main_pia21423-png.png) of the view from one of the planets
Oh man, the thought of some planets sunsets and sunrises blows my mind. to have a few planets in plain view et al not to mention the colours different quantities of gases in the atmosphere and how they would affect colours etc.
If intelligent life evolved elsewhere I imagine that a close and undeniable view of other planets would be a prerequisite to them developing space oriented tech.    Imagine that you are an intelligent being on a tidally locked planet, but your view of space is nothing but a thick atmosphere that is lighter on some parts of the surface and darker on other parts of the surface and never changes.  Would it ever occur to you to look at the stars and wonder what's out there?  unrelated musing:  would the planets in that system interact with each other enough to keep a molten core and a magnetic field?
> Planets are so close, they interact gravitationally on each other.  This is definitely the most interesting part to me. Their closeness is less than the distance between the sun and Mercury! I feel like these shouldn't be stable or something. At the very least I wonder if the climates change more frequently than on earth due to things like changes in axial tilt.  Edit: From the abstract:  >The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain, such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.1 and 12.35 days) are near-ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed farther from the star and migrated inwards.  Fascinating! Let's get this team an AMA!
"All the planets are very close to the Trappist-1 star, even the outermost planet in that system is six times closer to it's star than Mercury is to the Sun, but Trappist-1 star is a ""M-dwarf"" which means it's a lot of smaller than our Sun. Another thing is that some, if not all the planets, due to extreme proximity to the star they orbit, are probably ""tidally locked"" so all the time only the 1 side of the planet faces it, although there still may be hospitable regions there, just confined to the bands between dark and light side of the planets."
Assuming NASA finds one of these planets, or any future planet, with an atmosphere composition that is extremely likely to be caused from/host life, whats our next step? I think if we are able to determine if a planet has a high liklihood to have life in only 5-10 years we should definitely get started full speed on technology that will help us see, speak to, and/or get to the planet like... now. I know there are a lot of proposed technologies and methods to do one of the above options but I haven't heard of any general consensus (with at least with near future technology) on the one, let alone two, best ways to do so.
> And as long as NASA's budget doesn't get cut,  Good new bad news...the budget that is being discussed as on the chopping block is the earth facing budget. They are talking about adding budget to study the ~~starts~~ stars...
Imagine being the intelligent life being there. 3 possible planets and a star that will shine for far longer than our sun.
The exoplanets are a lot closer to the star than planets in our solar system are to ours. 
Whenever i think of the possibilities i become really sad that i probably won't see them.
The star was ~~found~~ studied with a telescope, named Trappist. The telescope is located in Chili, but researchers from the University in Liege, Belgium control it. Trappist is a Belgian beer brewed by monks, they gave that name to the telescope. They ~~found~~ studied the dwarf star with that telescope, the official name of the star is  2MASS J23062928-0502285. Its trivial name is the Trappist - 1.
In your life time? <1%. Some out there designs for ramjets or antimatter rockets could get you to maybe 10%. Of course with the magic Alcubierre drive, we could get there in an instant.   Realize, that for conventional physics, there is an upper limit to these things. You wouldn't want to accelerate much faster than 1g in order to keep your passengers comfortable. Which leads nicely to my favorite graph: round trip travel times with constant 1g acceleration.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_travel_using_constant_acceleration#/media/File:Roundtriptimes.png  Arcturus is about as far away as the TRAPPIST star, meaning that for your passengers, the round trip would take ~13 years or so. But a little less than a century would pass on Earth before you returned. 
Dude. That's awesome. Just made me love our boring, little, one moon world a little bit more. 
Yeah but these planets have dark sides. Stargazing 24/7.
I found my new wallpaper
So far as the climate change, the longest orbital period is 20 days or so. I don't think they would have seasons the same way we do, but warm days and cool days. Also the sun is a lot less bright and because they are so close, the variation in temperature is probably a lot lower.  EDIT: Okay people. I know they are tidally locked. You don't have to keep pointing that out. Thanks.
Wouldn't significant gravitational interactions mean that there could be drastic changes in their climate/rotation/orbit/etc that might make it more difficult for life to evolve there?
I think it would take about 700,000 years at current speed..we're gonna need some big advancements, exciting stuff! 
"Big issues is it being 40 light years away. My understanding is that with our current technology the fastest a ship could travel is just under 19,000 years for a single light year. This obviously makes the idea of sending deep space radio waves the quickest way to ""contact"" any potential life but this assumes that firstly there is sentient life as we understand it and that they are in a similar period of technology. These things are incredibly unlikely.   I'm excited by the announcement but for now we're still that isolated pale blue dot until we can make some rapid technological advances. "
I can't understand your sentence
Think if each of those possible planets had intelligent life on them.  First contact for them (between each other)would be an interesting idea to ponder.
Does that present a greater radiation threat at all to the planets themselves though? I don't know much about radioactive output of smaller stars
>The star was found with a telescope, named Trappist.  No, the star was already known when the Belgians decided to observe it with TRAPPIST.  It was found with the 2MASS survey, which is why the name starts with 2MASS.
Here's something thatll really make you feel special, then. Our moon just happens to be at the right distance and size to give us the spectacular total solar eclipses we enjoy every few years. If the moon were much bigger or closer, it would block out the sun and its Corona, and an eclipse would look the same as night time. If it were smaller or farther, it wouldn't block out enough of the sun to see the Corona, and we'd just see a black circle cross the star. It's complete happenstance that our moon is about the same apparent radius as our sun.   If there's tons of earth's out there, all with their own oceans and their own ecosystems, if the universe has produced countless intelligent species over the eons, you can at least take comfort in the fact that we might be the only ones privelidged with such unique eclipses. Life might be common, but earth's moon and sun are definitely one of a kind.
Our moon's actually pretty big for a moon, so that's cool
Why does being closer imply a smaller temperature variation?
>There is a developing plan to launch small nanoprobes to the Alpha Centauri system, the closest stars to us, known as Breakthrough Starshot. With a network of large lasers on Earth, it just might be possible to accelerate a probe to roughly 20 percent the speed of light by constantly hitting a reflective surface with the concentrated beams of light. This technology, known as photonic propulsion, could allow us to reach Alpha Centauri in 20 or 30 years.  >But we're not going to TRAPPIST-1 anytime soon. It's about eight times farther away than Alpha Centauri. Even if we could launch a probe at relativistic speeds, it would take two centuries to get there, the immense distance makes it unlikely that it would arrive at all. Even if it did, detecting a signal from a small nanoprobe 40 light-years away would be darn near impossible. For now, we need to study the TRAPPIST system from home.  Edit: From [the popular mechanics article](http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a25336/seven-earth-like-planets-trappist-1/) 
Space exploration funding isn't at risk. Study of earth's systems funding is. 
They'd immediately think the entire universe must be teeming with life. 
It depends. If the planets have active interiors like Earth, then they could have magnetospheres. If they have atmospheres, that would also mitigate radiation, the thicker the better.  The problem with red dwarf stars is that they tend to be what's known as [flare stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare_star). With the planets so close to the parent star, if TRAPPIST-1 is a flare star, those planets would be getting cooked by solar flares.
It's even more than that. Right now might be the only time this specific event can occur. Since the moon isn't stationary, it is slowly receding away from Earth at a few centimeters a year.   So, earlier in Earth's history, it would have indeed been too large. And millions of years from now, it will be too small. 
Definitely? I hate to quibble...
And it's tidally locked, which is unusual.  Very late edit: this is apparently NOT unusual.
I think they mean the planets' orbits are relatively close to each other, so their temperatures might not be drastically different from one another. The habitable zone is a lot different from ours though because the star is cooler than ours
So our longest day (Northern hemisphere)  is June 20th or so, but our hottest day isn't until usually until July or August in most places. This is because the atmosphere and water take a while to warm up, so it's the accumulation of many long days before we finally reach peak heat. If the year is only 20 days long, then there's only 10 days between the longest and shortest days.
I'm not sure how much of this is dreaming, but the thought that we could make it to another star system in under 30 years is incredible. 
Given that the planets have gravitational effects on each other, the possibility of their cores being active is quite high, actually.
Even better, that means only humans living around this time can enjoy our special privilege.
And it's the same size in the sky as the sun is which allows for full Solar Eclipses.  Total coincidence!
Its nothing but very small probe. Theres no way you can accelerate anything big to that speed with current technology
Born too late to explore the planet and too early to explore the stars :(
oh shit that's a good point.  So we have:  * Earth sized * Habitable Zone * Probably magnetic field to shield from cosmic radiation  This is super exciting.
We're so privileged to live in this generation, imagine living during that Black Plague.. that would be not fun. 
I wonder if intelligent life has observed Earth from a distance and gave out these facts about our planet and moon before. I also can't help but wonder if one of these factors about our moon is somehow fully necessary for life to begin, in some way science hasn't thought of yet. 
I never even thought of that... So cool.
I guess what I mean to say that there is now a visible technological *path* rather than pure theory or science-fiction. That this is on the horizon, even if for a generation or few down the line, is exciting. 
Parachutes.
[but the memes](http://cdn.iwastesomuchtime.com/92420140742144.png) 
You are right to think this -- the moon is [responsible for the rotation of the earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis) and for the daily tides.  Both are currently thought to be critical stressors that caused single-celled organisms to have to adapt to an ever-changing environment, a primary driver of evolution.  [Here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/moon-life-tides/) is a brief article on the effect of the moon on early life on earth.
So instead of beach front property being the most sought after we would have sunset front property?  I never thought about being able to live in perpetual sunset, that would be crazy.

I was definitely NOT going to watch it.   As someone with severe depression and schizoid personality disorder, just the thought of it triggered me. Do not subject yourself to deep moral questions about suicide if you’re already suicidal. They will swallow you up.
"The usual disclaimer from the article:  > the researchers cannot make a causal link between the release of ""13 Reasons Why"" and the observed changes in suicide rates."
"Suicide rates spiked after Robin Williams died, too.   I don't really know what you do with the fact that reminding people that suicide exists is correlated with increases in people committing suicide. The rest of the non-suicidal world is not going to self-censor and cease acknowledging, reporting on, or talking about suicide for fear of reminding suicidal people that suicide is a thing. That's just not a rational or a feasible expectation.   It doesn't have to be ""glorified"" or ""portrayed irresponsibly"". Simple factual reports of high-profile suicides are correlated with small increases in the suicide rate. There isn't a way around the ""oh, yeah, suicide is a thing, maybe I can do that"" effect. You can't force the whole world to pretend it doesn't exist for the sake of a small minority of suicidal people."
I kinda half watched it with my wife and was like... God damn this show is pretty poorly written but its super God damn depressing.  As a pretty frequently suicidal person (not lately thank god) it just made me feel crappy watching it, it didnt give me any enjoyment, but they really just portray scenes that are sad and depressing.  Its like law and order SVU without the quirky twists and random bouts of gunfire and action.
was going to say I can't remember the name but I think it was American something that has guides on how to report or write about suicide but the show went against them all
So when you read those numbers in the headline, it's a bit easier to distance yourself from the deaths, but several paragraphs into the OP article:  >This increase translated into an additional estimated 195 suicide deaths between April 1, 2017, and Dec. 31, 2017.  That's potentially 195 deaths *because of a TV show.*  More than any mass shooting ever.  Deadlier than most airline crashes.  Did you know [Robin Williams's suicide caused a 10% increase in suicides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5802858/) in the months after?  But it's even worse because that's not limited to teenagers, and investigators believe:  >we observed 18,690 suicides in that period, suggesting an excess of **1,841** cases (9.85% increase).  (emphasis mine)  1,841 people dead because the news told them that Robin Williams died by suicide.  For reference, the largest airline death count in history was approx. 1,700 from AA Flight 11 on 9/11.  What a terrible legacy.  We *have* to change how the media handles suicides.  And mass shootings for that matter.
I've worked in search and rescue in an area very well known for suicide. It's sad but ultimately it's just better not to report on it, at least not on a case by case basis. I hope those considering it, at least in the States, call the Suicide Hotline and talk to someone (not sure what it is for other countries). Take five minutes and just give them a call.
If only they would follow this idea for people committing mass shootings as well.
I think a lot of evidence points to males being better at completing suicide. Although there may have been similar numbers of attempts from females, Im lead to believe guys have a tendency to use more lethal means to do so, leading to decreased ability to interrupt their attempt
Only for boys, only for the 10-17 age cohort, and also starting ahead of when the show came out.   The explanation for this cannot be the handling of suicide in the show, because the start of the increase was when the show was being marketed but not actually released. The explanation must simply be the fact that the show brings up suicide at all (or that the spike is just a coincidence). In March, when suicide first spiked, nobody had seen the show.   Speaking of it being a coincidence, the authors of this study cut and carve a lot of age cohorts and demographics. There is going to be some natural fluctuation in the research. And the results didn’t happen like you would have expected if you pre-registered (effect in boys but not in girls).   This feels like a study that is much flimsier than the headlines it’s going to generate.
Indeed, the revengeful aspect of Hannah's suicide is in some ways more upsetting. It conveys the idea that suicide is a method to haunt who have done wrong to you (Bryce, Zack ecc.)
"I must add that children/teenagers and adults see films very differently! When I was a teenagers our class was taken for a movie ""Requiem for a Dream"". It is about heroin addicts. When I watched it now as an adult I was absolutely terrified how the drug ruined the life of all of those young people. But when I was a teen I only remembered how fun their lifestyle was, how they did what they wanted and just chilled. The scary end was unnoticed!"
"I'm pretty sure it did.  back when the live-aciton movie of 101 dalmatians came out, there was a surge of dalmatian adoptions. And a surge of dalmatians abandonement, because they are not great family dogs. Very good dog, good workers and serious dogs. Not ""golden retriever""-like good."
Came here to say this. After hearing how directly suicide rates are affected by media portrayal it becomes shocking that a show like this could have even been released.   I watched the show soon after I had listened to this podcast and it was clear that the creators were either completely unaware of this, or just didn’t care.
It glorifies suicide so much. The show made me angry. You’re exactly right about her being the “hero” of the show.  I imagine people felt something like, “if I take my life, my tormentors will be tormented” Because that’s what happened in the show. She had the whole elaborate scheme to expose everything and I think it just made people more reassured that life after their death would be hell for the people they felt attacked by.  It’s a really dark and unfortunate thing but I always felt the show was a terrible idea.
That applies to literally almost any study.
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP)
Didn’t they do that on purpose. Like they asked exactly what they shouldn’t do and then did that.
> (not sure what it is for other countries)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines
Very true. This is from the PDF of the article:  > Imitation may have contributed to the increase in the male youth suicide rate after the release of 13 Reasons Why, given a male adolescent character made a serious suicide attempt by firearm at the end of the series. A well-known gender paradox in suicide also exists, with male rates of suicide being higher than female rates and female rates of attempted suicide being higher than male rates across the lifespan.  and  >Although non-fatal suicide attempt rates may have increased for girls after the release of 13 Reasons Why, national monthly suicide attempt data were not available to address this question.
Men are also less likely to express suicidal thoughts/feelings or confide in friends before attempting, making it less likely they'll have help called for them or anything.
You're right. They mention this in their limitations:  > The observation that the series was first released on March 31, 2017 and suicide rates increased that month also raises questions about effects of pre-release media promotion of the series premiere.   It'd be a strange coincidence to have a statistically significant increase in suicides that April totally unrelated to this widely watched show, but the fact that they began increasing during promotion month (March) definitely raises questions about other causes vs. just promotional effects.
I think sometimes we underestimate boys and their varied interests.
When irl, what usually happens is that the people who actually loved you are devastated (often in the long term) and while the people you wanted to get revenge on might feel guilty, they eventually move on.  And you're still dead
Also I remember that when the show was at peak popularity, someone pointed out that the results of the suicide was very harmful. She commits suicide because no one would listen to her or believe her and now that she is dead everyone believes her and things actually change for the better.
Yes, it also justifies suicide, that is literally what it does. It says because of this and this I had to do it, not because of my decision.  Also, as per my other comment, what adult movie makers and critics take away from a movie/TV and what teens/children take may be two very different lessons.
Same with clown fish after Finding Nemo.
This exactly. Normalizing conversations about suicide and depression is helpful and health-promoting. Glamourizing suicide is irresponsible, and can exacerbate suicidal ideation in vulnerable people.
Another reason why media doesn’t really talk about it. They don’t want it glamorized and make people think “they will notice me now” That’s just my thought though  Thinking more about it maybe it’s just a topic they are scared to face. Maybe it’s a reflection of all of us. Something we don’t want to talk about.  I said it below but for anyone who misses it   Bad news is good news for major media outlets except if its Suicide.
[Netflix hired a consultant ](https://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/2017/04/suicide_expert_consulted_by_netflix_on_13_reasons_why_told_them_not_to_release_i.html) who warned them about suicide contagion, and they went ahead with it anyway. It seems at least [one of the writers has been suicidal](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/13-reasons-why-suicide-controversy-nic-sheff-writer) before and had good intentions with the way it was depicted, but after so much backlash and discussion, I find it hard to give them the benefit of the doubt as they continue to stand by it.
Yeah. Studies by nature cannot prove causal relationships.  Obviously nobody will set a bunch of kids up, have a control group watch Marley & Me, and have another group watch 13 Reasons Why, and see which group commits more suicide.  So I think this is the closest we’ll get.
"More like ""there's a correlation but we can't prove it's causation.""    Correlations like this should be studied, not ignored.  If something else is causing the 29% hike, someone needs to figure out what it is.  Not assuming things isn't bad science.  It's good science."
Additionally, American Association of Suicidology
Not that I know of but they were contacted and told what to do and ignored it iirc
>A well-known gender paradox in suicide also exists, with male rates of suicide being higher than female rates and female rates of attempted suicide being higher than male rates across the lifespan.  Is that really a paradox? It seems pretty obvious that women would have more suicide attempts on average over a lifetime if they succeed less often. You can't attempt suicide again if you succeed the first time after all.
I think this actually tracks with the methods, too.  The woman who kills herself in 13 Reasons Why does so via slashing her wrists- this is a notoriously ineffective method of suicide, and anyone attempting the same in tribute will *probably* be rescued before they bleed out.  The man who makes an attempt does so by firearm, which is not only notably a more effective method, but also has much more catastrophic consequences for failure, leaving the attempter horribly disfigured or disabled (and possibly in a persistent vegetative state). This means that even failed attempts at suicide by firearm are often successful ones, just not instantly.
Redo the show where Hannah gets revenge by living a happy fulfilling life.
Yeah, the show actually was on point in its themes, but made it too clear that the suicide of Hannah had been used as a revenge method and this could have lead some exasperated people to try to imitate her in a sort of sadistic attempt to copycat the effects of Hannah's suicide on who was around her.
"I'm not sure the word ""depression"" is even used at all in the show, either. Her suicide is essentially just a way of getting revenge. It's pretty disappointing for a show that claims to be about opening up a conversation about mental health."
"I think the ""gender paradox"" refers to the fact that there's any gender discrepancy at all between the sexes when it comes to suicide behaviors."
Seriously though, more stuff like that needs to be out there for teen. It probably would have helped me a lot when my depression was at its worst.
"As a suicidal teen I thought many times about killing myself and writing notes for my bullies so they'd know what they'd done to me and I don't think it's an uncommon train of thought.   The show to me was basically suicide porn and I believe it to be extremely dangerous for young people.   Not once is her mental health or the word ""depression"" mentioned. She is always painted as being completely justified to the point where it really seems like she has no other option."
The paradox is that while there is a larger number of females attempting suicide, male suicide rate is higher than females. This means males tend to use methods that have a higher chance of fatality than females. I would assume, both from literature and experience with acquaintances who have committed/attempted suicide, that males tend to jump from a tall objects, hang, or shoot themselves and females tend to slash their wrists, take pills, or hang themselves (as well). While there are a bunch of other ways people do this I’m just thinking about the main ones that I can think of. I think there are quite a few suicides that aren’t exactly an attempt to kill themselves but are more-so a cry for help, like taking pills or drinking an excessive amount of alcohol.
"Yeap this is ingrained in boys/men very early on in life.  ""Boys don't cry"" ,""stop being a crybaby"","
To add to this, I found her suicide to be totally unbelievable considering her mental state. People who are suicidal and depressed don't have the foresight to make their suicide a game.   The one thing I would like to know is if this show helped break down suicide stigma and if that could have overall positive info. Either way the show does a terrible job of showing a person actually contemplating suicide.
This is the standard reductive answer on Male depression and it is just damaging. Men do talk about their issues, but we don't get listened to or valued because we may not express sadness in the way it is expected and when you open up about issues and no one listens, or you have no one who can listen then that puts you on a dark road where life feels pointless and suicide feels like the only option to fix it.  I can talk about my suicidal thoughts and a decade of depression and not shed a single tear because it's not they way I deal with those emotions. Depression isn't crying constantly and being sad in my personal experience it's been the absence of happiness and the inability to enjoy life or feel enthusiasm about anything.
I e never understood why a smoker is so ok with littering. If they finish a bag of chips- do they throw that on the ground?  Serious question. The smokers that drop their smoke and crush it with their shoe- do they litter in other ways or no?
Charge a manufacturer 25c per butt “core charge” and they’ll get cleaned up and they’ll educate clients up front.
I think I remember something about a place that trained crows to do it. There were little machines around that would dispense a bird-friendly treat whenever a cigarette butt was placed in the receptacle. Crows, being smart, quickly figured this out and took advantage of it.
I used to smoke, honestly thought they were biodegradable and was more concerned that I might accidentally set a garbage can on fire from tossing a slightly lit butt. I only stopped tossing them when a friend pointed out that animals might eat them and get sick.  So I suppose to answer the question, some might not think that they're littering. Others may do it due to lack of convenient alternatives. In any case, I've found that polite suggestion can sometimes be enough to completely kill the habit.
That was the idea, they never got it off the ground and the project was abandoned :( https://www.crowdedcities.com
Nailed it. You see old butts on the side of the road and they sure look like they're breaking down. I've also seen several trash can fires from butts that weren't quite all the way out.
One would think, but flicking a butt gives you +10 charisma
-100 depending on who sees it...
Studies have shown that states with abstinence only sex education have higher teen pregnancy AND second time teen pregnancy rates  than states who teach safe sex
Just like the D.A.R.E. program, the “because I told you not to” philosophy of prevention does NOT work.   Edit: For anyone interested in information on the D.A.R.E. program’s shortcomings, [here is an article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-just-say-no-doesnt-work/) that summarizes and includes links to further research.
I was just talking about this, how for instance religious people will preach an abstinence only position. So instead of buying condoms or birth control in case something ever arises, which would be like admitting that you're going to have sex at some point, they pretend they are immune to human nature. Then in the heat of the moment, they have unprotected sex and end up with unwanted pregnancies.
Sex is a human instinct. Teaching about it in a negative light is only going to cause conflict in a teenager's mind
Interestingly, combining abstinence education with sex ed makes teenagers more likely to choose abstinence. I’ve never understood “abstinence only” in the face of the evidence.  
Abstinence-only is pretty well understood to be not only ineffective but often times even self-detrimental.
I mean the program doesn't prevent pregnancy. But neither program prevents sex.  The contraceptive version prevents pregnancy, not sex.
Abstinence education is solely there to appease puritanical fears of administrations and parents, it never was and never will be about actually protecting or benefitting teens
High school teacher in an abstinence only state here checking in. Shit's ridiculous.  We all get creative in addressing questions or issues from students. For example, I teach psychology which happens to cover human development. When fetal development comes up, students have questions. As long as I answer it from a standpoint of development and academia, I can respond. I let that conversation take as looooooong as they ask legitimate questions.  They have some horrifying misconceptions.
I don't doubt the stats, but I wonder if socioeconomic status is also correlated?
"I think it's less the abstinence only method of teaching than it is the ""if we just don't talk about it we don't have to deal with it"" approach to anything sex ed related.  I went to grade school in Peoria Arizona. We didn't get sex Ed. What they called sex ed was a single, one hour ""class"" taught to 5th graders in the library by a guest speaker who literally only taught  male and female anatomy, only with drawings or blacked out or heat images of a penis, or vagina, and completely ignored anything sex related. It was never spoken of again except by the kid who called someone else a testicle after class and got suspended.  They aspired to abstinence teachings. Everything I learned about sex was from porn or trial and error. "
Partially because abstinence only sex education often involves literally lying about the efficacy of things like condoms. 
Yeah... I've been hearing about studies drawing this conclusion since at least the 1990s. 
Yeah, the science is not the problem, it's the problem is the people in charge not understanding or not caring about the science.   This issue has always puzzled me. It is an issue where both sides want similar things (no sex vs no Babies) but one of the sides is unwilling to move even though moving doesn't mean they have to support sex and they even stand to help their own cause if they do adjust.   This isn't an issue like abortion which is indeed a grey area and both sides have good and bad points ( which is a great example but I don't want or intend to discus abortion further). This is an example of people literally not wanting to change even though they are hurting their own cause. Very odd indeed. 
"Not just ""I told you not to"" but also the scare tactics don't work for most people. The drug talks at my schools until I went to university were pretty much ""don't smoke weed because by the end of the week you'll have no teeth and you'll be sucking dick for your hourly meth injection.""  Which is fine, until that first person you know smokes weed and they just show up to school the next day. And then a friend drinks under aged and they aren't a homeless teen prostitute by Tuesday. Or you find out that one of your totally functional parents has a secret weed stash. And then the whole narrative falls apart, and you start to wonder if the whole thing is just made up and drugs are actually totally fine, the grown ups just want the drugs for themselves.  At university, our drug talk was basically ""if you're going to do drugs, write down what you took and slip the envelope under your floor fellows' door so that if you overdose or freak out we know what to tell the paramedics you are on. And that talk definitely deterred more drug use than all the elementary and high school talks combined."
Prohibitons are never truly effective and create many externalities.
This same mentality is applied to the gardasil vaccine (for HPV). There are many who never want to admit that their kids will at some point have sex (or that humans often have multiple sex partners once they are sexually active), so they're not getting them the HPV shot around age 12 (recommend), which protects them against a wide variety of deadly, chronic, or uncomfortable conditions... All because of this puritanical attitude.
Not to mention most don't believe in abortion, so they then have a child they didn't plan for, and one they can't take care of.
Unfortunately churches have taken a while to realize this and still are. I was born in the 90’s and got this sort of frenzied “Sex is GOOD but if you have sex you will DIE” style of abstinence education from my church. Now, I teach Sunday school, and at our yearly large group child development meetings they usually have a section where they encourage us to be very sex positive, to avoid several phrases we often heard when we were kids, to allow children to explore themselves privately, and to gently guide them in the right direction. 
Can you give us examples of the misconceptions that your students might have?
That's what scientific studies are about: considering and accounting for other potential contributory factors to determine whether the factors being investigated actually have an effect.  Like [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194801/):  > Using the most recent national data (2005) from all U.S. states with information on sex education laws or policies (N = 48), we show that increasing emphasis on abstinence education is positively correlated with teenage pregnancy and birth rates. ***This trend remains significant after accounting for socioeconomic status,*** teen educational attainment, ethnic composition of the teen population, and availability of Medicaid waivers for family planning services in each state.   > **These data show clearly that abstinence-only education as a state policy is ineffective in preventing teenage pregnancy and may actually be contributing to the high teenage pregnancy rates in the U.S.**  That study came out in 2011.  [The 2012 TX GOP Party Platform](https://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012Platform_Final.pdf) expressly opposed teaching critical thinking skills.  
I would assume so. Also I’d imagine religion plays a big role  ‘And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.’  A lot of religions also oppose birth control and abortions. 
Meanwhile, in a Catholic school in MD in the '90s, I got my first sex ed class in the fourth grade, and it was more detailed than I was even ready for at the time. And we had one every year thereafter, too.
Isnt the pro abstinence side fuel mostly by religios dogma?
That was the issue, it was the equivocation.  Weed is just as bad as heroin.  Condoms don’t prevent anything.     Ignorance is never helpful.
Never is a strong word. We have a prohibition on explosive armaments, and it has worked out pretty well for us. 
Right?  I've had to resort to telling my friends that 1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted. Sometimes that includes rape. Worst case scenario,  your daughter will be safe from cervical cancer because she was raped.   (No one likes this better, but if the other person firmly believe that *their* kid will never have sex outside of a perfect marriage, this will have to do)
This logic is essentially saying :I'm religious and don't want my child to have sex before marriage, if they do I believe the appropriate punishment for their transgression is cancer.    Also, if they do abstain from sex until marriage and end up marrying someone who had previously had sex then they still believe that their child should be punished with cancer. 
Yeah I’m sexually active now and my mom wouldn’t let me have the vaccine 7 years ago because of this. Don’t even know where to get it now or if here’s a point to it since I’ve already had sex.  Hope I don’t get cancer, mom.
That a woman can only get pregnant if she has an orgasm is a REALLY common one. 
"Also: no knowledge of the actual mechanics of conception (ovulation, sperm count in fluid not just ejaculation, egg to uterus process, etc) and thinking one can rely on ""pull out game"" is also common"
"One of my favorite common misconceptions is the ""I had sex once and didn't get pregnant, so I'm infertile"". on the MTV show 16 and Pregnant they asked each girl at the end how/why they ended up pregnant. I was shocked by how many answered with some form of that response."
"The relevant part:  > Knowledge-Based Education – We oppose the teaching of Higher > Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values > clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are > simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based > Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging > the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority."" "
but we're not talking about 'a lot of religions' are we?  We're talking about American Christianity
Yes, the idea is that if you teach teenagers about safe sex (condoms, what STDs are, how to actually practice safe sex, etc.) that you will end up encouraging it.   I was raised in a rather religious household, Baptist if anyone is wondering. I no longer believe most of what I was taught, but the idea is that sex is immoral, and to talk about it is equally immoral. And therein lies the issue, once it becomes immoral, then it ends up being a emotional issue. And convincing someone that they are wrong on an emotional issue is quite difficult
> Ignorance is never helpful.  Not helpful *to the recipient* of the message.  Ignorance is frequently very helpful for the people promoting it. Whether for ideological reasons or for profit.
The larger thing is, when you’re prohibiting something, make sure you get your facts right.   Are we trying to prohibit nuclear weapons in warfare because they cause insane collateral damage? That’s absolutely true, all facts point that out, and people follow it.   Are you trying to prohibit marijuana because it will make you a homeless prostitute crack dealer? Literally 0 facts will back that up, and you’ll lose any credibility you had as soon as people start to figure that out. 
Both males and females can get the vaccine up until age 26. Your local/city public health clinic will have the vaccine and can probably vaccinate you on a same day appt. If your doctor's office carries vaccines like flu shots, they probably have it in stock because of the VFC Program (Vaccines for Children); federal funds allocated for vaccines that individual states use in their vaccine programs. Only cost to you is $30 nurse administration fee; vaccine itself should be no charge as it's considered preventive medicine and insurance or state pays for it.  Therefore, call your doc or local health clinic!! Better to get than never try, can still protect you better than if you don't get it.  www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hpv.html
Really? What is the rationale behind that myth?
It’s a common theme throughout most religions.
Much like you, I grew up in an ultra conservative household. Sex was taboo and not talked about aside from those random youth group gatherings where we were basically scolded.   None of it discouraged me in the least from having as much sex as possible up until I met my wife and got married.   I never really minded using protection either because my sophomore year health teacher was phenomenal.
I'm guessing some kind of misunderstanding of partial grapevine knowledge (so they learn (again, incorrectly) from their friends that a GUY must orgasm to get a girl pregnant and extrapolate from there.
Sexual control is one of religion’s most powerful tools. It gives them good control over a shitload of people. 
"Baptists actually don't care that much. Within the confines of a Christian marriage, Baptists don't particularly care if you practice family planning of some kind. Condoms, birth control... it's fine. ""Be fruitful"" is taken less literally and understanding is given that having children beyond your means to care for isn't helping anyone.   The reason Baptists oppose sex ed and birth control is that they believe it will lead to more premarital sex, which is of the devil and will ruin your morals and of you're having sex as a teenager what's to stop you from doing meth and having orgies and being gay? So discussion of family planning and sex ed should only be between married adults, and possibly from parents teaching their children - parents who are of course good God- fearing Christians who will tell their children how evil premarital sex is.   Source: southern Baptist preacher's kid. "
"Reminds me of anti-abortion messaging. Remember Todd Akin, the congressman who thought women had to want it to get pregnant, and thus believed ""abortion in the case of rape"" was some kind of purely hypothetical liberal smokescreen? A ""you only get pregnant if you enjoy it"" myth seems like an extension of that."
"Sexual control has been a tool of power since pretty much the moment stratified societies exist. I recommend reading Michel Foucault on this, for all his faults, his analysis of how sexuality plays into how power works within society is rather succinct.  Basically, after the church had tried to control the way people have sex, when bourgeois republics became influential they even more aggressively used medicine and the new field of psychoanalysis and psychology to regulate sexuality. This was when a lot of things happened, you weren't just a man who had sinned by sleeping with a man, for example, but suddenly you were identified by this ""perversion"" which was seen as something deeply part of your very identity which had to be ""cured"".  At the center of it all was the myth of a healthy societal body. Just as absolute monarchy had the image of the monarch, whose body and mind had to be perfected as an image to represent the state, a republican state had to regulate, discipline and perfect this societal body. Add to this the constant eat-or-be-eaten dynamic of capitalism which arose at that time, and you have a quite sinister dynamic, which had birthed eugenics and genocide on a level that hadn't really existed before - at least not in this sophisticated way.  The basic dynamic has persisted to this day, even though it has of course also evolved. One example Slavoj Zizek brings up was when he was reading an in-flight magazine once, which had an article praising sex - mind you not for pleasure - but because ""it is good for you"", healthy, burns calories, etc. , thus also regulating the way we are having sex and delegating it to the societal imperative to perfect yourself to be as healthy and productive as possible."
Wasn't there a rape case where the rapist tried to argue that since his victim had an orgasm, it means she wanted it so it wasn't really rape?
"Ah yes, in those cases, the woman has the ability to ""shut that process down."" Or something"
Yeah, the same anti-abortion people who say that contraception causes infertility in like 1 in 10 women and that abortion causes breast cancer. The misinformation and pseudoscience I used to hear from the pulpit and from activists back when I was religious was absolutely sickening. The worst is that they preach it directly to teens as young as middle school, so it's no surprise they have no clue how any of it *actually* works. 
This has been known for a while. A quick google search brings up quite a few past articles about this “discovery” Here’s one from NYT 2012: https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/science/flavor-is-the-price-of-tomatoes-scarlet-hue-geneticists-say.html
Would growing your own tomatoes work around this or would the seeds be the same in stores?
"My 95 year old grandfather has been complaining about tomatoes for years, ""they're just not what they used to be."" He says when he was a kid they used to eat tomatoes like you'd eat an apple. I'm kind of excited to tell him this news."
Wait- so what are the 7% variety with the flavor gene? And how do you identify them and where do you get them?
The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here:   > Store-bought tomatoes taste horrifically disgusting — err, bland. Now scientists have discovered a version of a gene that helps give tomatoes their flavor is actually missing in about 93 percent of modern, domesticated varieties. The discovery may help bring flavor back to tomatoes you can pick up in the produce section.

Giovannoni & Zhangjun Fei   Nature Genetics (2019)   Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0410-2  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-019-0410-2  Abstract  Modern tomatoes have narrow genetic diversity limiting their improvement potential. We present a tomato pan-genome constructed using genome sequences of 725 phylogenetically and geographically representative accessions, revealing 4,873 genes absent from the reference genome. Presence/absence variation analyses reveal substantial gene loss and intense negative selection of genes and promoters during tomato domestication and improvement. Lost or negatively selected genes are enriched for important traits, especially disease resistance. We identify a rare allele in the TomLoxC promoter selected against during domestication. Quantitative trait locus mapping and analysis of transgenic plants reveal a role for TomLoxC in apocarotenoid production, which contributes to desirable tomato flavor. In orange-stage fruit, accessions harboring both the rare and common TomLoxC alleles (heterozygotes) have higher TomLoxC expression than those homozygous for either and are resurgent in modern tomatoes. The tomato pan-genome adds depth and completeness to the reference genome, and is useful for future biological discovery and breeding.
That would be amazing. Literally the only thing I miss about growing up in Illinois was our small family farm. We grew the most delicious tomatoes I've ever eaten. Some nights i would get hungry and just go to the garden and pick a tomato and eat it with cottage cheese and pepper.
Some of us have been noticing this for decades? Tons of people still grow their own right
Depends which seeds you buy. I grow heirloom varieties from seed. I order them online from Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds and they are much more flavorful. My favorite variety so far has been the lucid gem tomato.
Heirloom tomatoes dont have this problem. You can actually look for different flavors of tomatoes on a scale of acidic to sweet. If that makes any sense.  Some are suited for salsas while some are amazing fresh in salads.
Carrots are the same way. Proper carrots are sweet and delicious. Store carrots are almost bitter when they're both flavorless.  No wonder people these days don't eat vegetables. They're actually gross.
The gene is uniform ripening.  Look at pictures of the fruit.  If its all the same uniform color there's a decent chance it has the uniform ripening gene.    [This](https://r.hswstatic.com/w_907/gif/grocery-tomatoes.jpg) would be bad.  [This](https://www.rareseeds.com/assets/1/14/DimRegular/Tomato-Cour-Di-Bue-TM121-web-2.jpg) would be better
I thought they were trying to get the tomato to look ripened consistently across the whole tomato and accidentally wiped out the gene that converted the starches to sugar.  Also after they breaded, did they deep fry?
> Edit: I'm leaving breaded, even tho I meant breeded.  bred. You meant bred.
It's not breeded either :(
This can't be the whole story. Store tomatoes suck, but 99% of home-grown tomatoes are the same varieties that have the gene talked about in the OP. They are still a hell of a lot better though.
Can you recommend a good tomato for salsas?
Thank you, I will follow your advice to judge them by their skin.
Not nessecelery.
no thanks, watching carb intake
> This can't be the whole story.  Store tomatoes suck, but 99% of home-grown tomatoes are the same varieties that have the gene talked about in the OP.  Its not. Store produce is never harvested at the same time you would at home. They're usually picked very pre-mature so they are 'ready' once in they make it to the store front. If they picked them when they were *actually* ripe, they'd be rotten long before they reached you.  So while, yes, they are likely still 'bland' compared to some other varieties. The primary culprit of the current flavorless, acidic state is the supply chain requirements, not the DNA
Personally for salsa I like patano romanesco. They're juicy but have enough flesh that they're not too watery when you cut them open. I live in California so depending on your location, your milage may vary. For fresh sliced tomatoes I'd definitely try the lucid gems, they have the fullest flavor of any variety I've grown. If you're looking for cherry tomatoes, barry's crazy cherry tomato (they're yellow and actually more grape-shaped) is fantastic and highly prolific. Last year, off of one ~3 ft tall plant, I had more cherry tomatoes than I knew what to do with.

Don’t get me started on local strawberries vs the cheap California ones.  Edit: I’ve tasted local Californian strawberries out in Sonoma. I don’t mean those. I mean the exported ones that were bred to be shelf stable, large, yet sadly flavourless. Just like the tomatoes in the article.
Thanks for the help!   I grow a salsa garden every summer, and usually just buy whatever plant looks in good condition at the local depot. Last year all my salsas tasted a little off, and im pretty sure it was the tomato variety I used.  I will use your recommendation!
There was a Strawberry Festival every year near my hometown.  *tears up*  Edit: Clearly I underestimated how many states and towns with annual Strawberry festivals there were
By reading reviews of them? Not sure what the other guy is talking about because the kinds of tomatoes you buy from seed are not the same tomatoes you are buying in your local grocery. On top of that fresh vine-ripened tomatoes taste better than anything you'll ever buy in a store. Check out /r/gardening if you want to know more.
Any chance you’re from the Plant City, FL area? I grew up around there and went to the Strawberry Festival every year. There is nothing quite as good as fresh strawberry shortcake made on warm, just-baked biscuits.
Growing up in the 90s we had a tomato garden every year and just used cheap seeds you could pick up in any store.  They were a million times better than any tomato I've ever bought. I remember sitting outside, surrounded by tomato plants, eating them right off the vine and reading a book. 10/10, would strongly recommend.
"From the article:   ""The paper had some limitations, including that only an association was found in the study -- not a causal relationship -- and more research is needed to determine why this association exists.""    The study only speculates on a possible explanation."
"""**This may be because drug dealers are replaced by licensed dispensaries that require proof of age.""**  This is editorial presumption, not part of the findings.   This is also where scientific articles and publications go wrong. - If that wasn't part of the study, and the results are not conclusive, then leave statements like this out. Chances are very hight that the ID requirement is not, at all, why MJ use among minors is falling. It could be that the legislation required more education (having an impact), it could be the measurement / reporting conditions changed, or it could be that the kids now see mom and grandma getting high, so it isn't cool anymore. Hard to know, since it wasn't in the scope of the study... at all."
No, it has nothing to do with replacing drug dealers with licensed dispensaries.  The phenomenon of falling drug use among the youth in decriminalized or legalized areas has been studied since the 1970s, and appears throughout the relevant substance use literature.  There is a correlation between criminalization of drugs and higher substance use because of the lack of harm reduction strategies and false or misleading information about the subject.  When illicit drugs are decriminalized or legalized, drug use among youth drops in almost every region.  Why this occurs is still debated, but it’s likely a combination of factors involving public health and safety and access to accurate and timely information about the drugs in question.  Lying to kids doesn’t work, and preventing them from getting accurate information only makes it worse.
Wouldn’t these underage teens just continue to purchase from their supplier?
My theory is cause vape/juul is the new trend so weed isn't really the top dog among the teenage crowd
That's basically boilerplate for any retrospective study.  The only way to establish causality would be to randomize states to legalize pot or not, which is not really plausible. You could also try to do an IV analysis, but good instruments are hard to find, particularly when the data set is so limited.  This is about as good as the data will ever get on this topic.
Every scientific article has a discussion section where some reasoned speculation is allowed, even welcomed. You are correct though in stating that it should be clear that these hypotheses should be further researched before being stated as facts. The title does seem to do that by using 'may'.
There's a guy in my colorado college town who is famous around campus and sells pretty much exclusively to under 21's.
In addition, it’s no longer illegal, which takes some of the “fun” out of doing it.  My thinking is  that part of why kids enjoy smoking weed is they’re not supposed to do it.  Edit: just to clarify, I’m not saying that illegality is the only, or even the primary, reason kids smoke weed, just that it’s *a* factor for some kids
Vaping weed in a manner very similar is absolutely HUGE right now.  That cannot be the reason.
WordSalad11 you are absolutely right, this is a fact of scientific research in humans the identifying of a causal relationship is impossible unless there is instrumental data collection. The point isnt to find causality, in fact causality is the limitation of this study. The findings are about correlation and that's about as good as your going to get.  Too bad people wont be informed about the nature of this scientific method before discounting it simply because it lacks the word 'causation'.
"It's still illegal for *kids* in those states to smoke weed, though.  edit: the replies I'm getting seem to be from people who look at the products their parents/teachers consume to decide what's cool, which I personally don't understand. While this is also speculation, I would think ""coolness"" doesn't have much to do with it. Is a teen less likely to drink if their parents and teachers sometimes drink? Because they now think drinking is lame? If anyone has a study for that I'd be interested in its findings."
"The perpetual plight of the social sciences! Without all those pesky ethics in the way, we could just set up a few small country sized ""Truman Show"" style enclosures and get all the hard data we need! ^^/s"
Yeah but it’s like the difference between hard liquor and Mike’s Hard Lemonade. Sure, both are illegal for a kid to have. But cracking open Barcardi or a bottle of Jameson whisky feels way more dangerous and cool that opening a can of Mike’s.
"Correct, but it isn't illegal for the parents/""squares"" to do so.   So now smoking weed makes you no cooler than your parents who do so.   >""Wow Kyle you smoke weed? So does my Dad... ""So"" cool dude.""  Stuff like that mentality. It's not the cool thing to do anymore if everyone can do it."
Explain underage drinking
congrats, probably the greatest feeling in the world!
As a counselor on a children's oncology unit, this is the kind of thing that always makes my day. Thank you for sharing your joy with us. And congratulations!!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!!!! 
Oh hey, I work at that hospital. Always great when they get to the other side of treatment successfully.  I hope it wasn't too rough for you guys, and wish her the best going forward!
Congratulations, I'm so happy for you!!! 
Throw her the biggest party! This will be a day she will remember for the rest of her life! Congratulations
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Second.   Also just wondering what kind of cancer she had and how was she treated?   Judging from her full head of hair id assume it wasn't chemo?
God bless you, seriously.  I have no idea how people involved with pediatric oncology do it. 
Work so hard forgot how to vacation   
If you're happy for her you won't shamelessly use her for upvotes 
Based on my mom's experience, I'd think she went through treatment quite awhile ago, and is just now being told she's cancer-free. My mom wasn't told she was in the clear until a couple years after chemo and radiation. That was 10 years ago though, so maybe things have changed. 
Yep. One of my friend's is a pediatric oncologist.  She has received extensive training on how to be empathetic and professional at the same time. But still cries in her office or at home. She tries really hard to stay focused on images like his and not the opposite.
Not until he realizes that he did something wrong. He has yet to apologize or take his post down.
I see. Is your mom doing well now? The cancer never returned since I hope.
She is doing well, thank you. Very grateful it has not returned. 
It's so amazing how we can all unit on this, I'm so happy for all the positive news about getting better, my mom is somewhere out there beyond this life but I know that it's these types of conversations and hope that she's want in the world today  I'm sorry I know it's mushy I'm not sure I'm drunk and I miss her so much, in somant instances of my life we take things for granted and you just don't know
I unfortunately don't have before photos, as my teeth were a huge source of shame for me and I got a lot of grief for how chipped and broken they were. I didn't know I was getting them fixed until I was in the middle of the procedure and the dentist asked if it'd be okay if he fixed my teeth for me. ❤️   Edit: thanks for the silver/gold/platinum everyone! Since this has made the front page though I'm highly considered deleting it since I'm getting a lot of less than wholesome things in my DMs. We'll see.   Edit2: I should make a SoundCloud just so I can promote it.  Edit3: Asking the mods to lock this because I’m getting attacked by r/braincels and r/mgtow users coming from posts on their subs.
You look like a beautiful mermaid! 
Dude your HAIR is amazing.
Your ex must have been one of the finest human being in the world  I actually wonder how one can sleep at night knowing you slammed someones face  Still, keep the good mood up and your ex can go duck himself 
Please tell me he went to jail
It's good that you don't have any before pictures because you can finally put that behind you. You are better and can finally put that chapter to rest
What did he say he was doing? Almost sounds like you just randomly woke up in the dentist office with him working on fixing your teeth, while a funny imagination I figure that is probably not how it went down.
Sounds like something Leslie Knope would say to Ann.
Thank you! I'm a hair stylist so I like being a walking advertisement for color services.
Yeah, what a quack.   EDIT: I'm so sorry for what I started. 
He did not. He ended up marrying my roommate, and suffered no consequences for his actions. ):
Perfect response!
"He was fixing a tooth I broke on a rock that was chipping off enamel, and since I recently switched dentists I had to explain at my first appointment why my teeth were so jacked up. He basically said to me ""since I have the materials out, do you mind if I just fix the rest of them for you too?"" and I gave him a thumbs up then he only charged me for the one tooth he originally was supposed to fix. It was nothing fancy, he just ground down the sharp edges on the bottom ones then filled in all the broken parts on the top with polymer. It's likely not super permanent and they're fragile, but it's good enough for me."
That's a shame. Honestly though abusers are never happy, they have unrealistic expectations and don't accept when they're wrong so they always end up miserable and blaming others 
I just had this done on my front teeth about a year ago.  Don't bite on anything hard with them and they should last a few years.  My dentist told me pretzels are the biggest source of chips
She's the one who held the door shut while he was beating the crap out of me and I was trying to escape.
That's wonderful- enjoy!
Dude... that's fucking awesome. Congrats! Care to share your story?
If you want to DM your address I'd love to send you a housewarming present!  I'm very proud of you! 
People are attacking OP in the comments. Such behavior does not belong in /r/happy and doesn't follow redditiquette.  I'll be locking the thread for now.
So happy for you!!!!

Just read your story and wow... I’m really sorry for everything that has happened in the past. Nevertheless, that’s an incredible turnaround and you should be very proud! Keep up the great work, wish you lots of luck and happiness from here on  :)

Thanks for the kind words everyone. I am signing off for now. This has been overwhelming.  And to the people wanting to know how I stayed so fat? Go watch my 600 pound life. I lived in shacks and abandoned houses but I still had people in my life that would buy me food.   Also, I did not ask for anyone to buy me anything. I got  hundreds of requests to start an amazon wishlist. I originally put a bed and some furniture on it. People kept saying to add more. I did. Look. I didnt ask for anything.  People then asked for my paypal to send me money. I said no. This is not a post to make money. I am here to do one thing, to share my story. I appreciate the help beyond words, I really do, but that was not my intention with this post. I expected to get 80 maybe 100 upvotes like my last threads. This went way above what I expected.
As long as its not anything illegal I'd love it!

Pay your taxes! I'm on SSI disability and without the $750 per month that I get(started getting it a few months ago), I would probably be dead.  
I really do want a cat or a dog, I love them both, and I've thought about it a lot, but I think I should learn how to take care of myself first before I put the life of another living being under my care.
“If anyone cares.” ... Hell yeah we care! Congrats!! Such a great feeling; you’re going to love every minute of it! Happy for you! 
It's amazing. Love the big windows and that you decided to put the desk next to one!! 
I think you need more books. Would you like some books?
Just finished reading your story and man I gotta say the amount of courage and strength you possess is awe inspiring.  To go through the hell you did and come out the other side wanting to better yourself and your life is admirable. You’ve got a lot of people rooting for you.  Congratulations on your first step, keep on climbing. 
I read the whole thing, and I can not fathom how you got from where you were to where you are.  I feel like you are already a success story... but keep going. This is big.  Sending good vibes your way! 
Lol nope I just reaaalllly like to decorate apartments:) 
At least it wasn't a 404. Apartment not found.

Hope everything turns out well for you OP.   Check out /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and don't forget to take care of your body. I know how bad the diet can be while homeless and now you have a kitchen. If people are offering, get some decent cookware and put it to good use.
Holy shit dude good job getting yourself out of there! Your new apartment looks really cozy! Good luck to ya! 
Mighty fine barn, but shes no meth shack.
Hey, now that you have a home address, and I see you have a computer, might I recommend you stop by your local library and sign up for a library card and also see what digital resources are available to you. Many have DVD, CD, Audiobook, ebooks and other media releases you can check out - or download, if you have Internet - for your media consumption pleasure.   Happy reading!

Congratulations man. One warning for you as you continue to add to your Amazon wish list. There is a very real chance that everything you put on it will be purchased. I've known people that were very poor or homeless that turned into hoarders when they found themselves on better footing. Consider everything you add to that list. Will you have room for it. Will it make your life better. I would never presume to lecture you about having things- you deserve some material happiness, but make sure that you don't become enslaved to those things, and more importantly,make sure that you don't become overwhelmed by them. It sounds stupid, but your mind needs to be on your mental and physical health. Every new item you receive is another small part of your brain occupied by taking care of your things and not with taking care of yourself.
I didn't want to be a negative Nelly but after reading his story, it was glaring how many things didn't add up.  Besides the fact that it's so well written for having only 2 years of elementary education, there were just too many things that didn't seem right. I honestly feel bad for anyone that has to fabricate such a horrific upbringing, just to garner attention. 
~~drugs~~ = drug  ugh, college here I come...

Remember to show up for class! I also recommend joining a club or group that you find interesting. The more time you find yourself on campus, the better you'll do.   Ninja edit: spelling, and I'm glad the advice is landing. Btw you can finish yourself off on campus, but just make sure you still make it to class on time.
Wow! Congratulations!!! I am very proud of you and hope you are very proud of yourself. You deserve it. Keep up the great work and best of luck to you!!

Best of luck bro, it won't always be easy but it will definitely be worth it. 
Thanks for the suggestion, I haven't really considered it, tbh I actually barely squeaked by in time to get in. As an addict too I kept thinking I'd be disqualified some how lol. Thank you kind stranger. I love and appreciate you.
Finishing myself of campus right now. I agree. 
Aww shucks stranger, you're amazing. Thank you for being you, I love and appreciate you!
Thanks bro, I appreciate you.

Got me a voice recorder and good old paper too. This class don't know what's coming. I love and appreciate you.
Glad you gave up smoking beer, OP!
Reach out to your professors too! Come to office hours, get to know them. I love when my students swing by my office hours because it gives me a chance to get to know them better. In addition to the money you pay to go to lecture, you're also paying for essentially free one-on-one tutoring with your tuition. Office hours any time you are lost, and chances are your school also has a tutoring or student success center. Check them out for even more help! Good luck, you got this :)

My mother left my father and he got full custody of me and my sister. This decision itself was one of the best ones he had ever made in life for us. "
You are fucking awesome 
I am a daughter that was raised solely by her father after my mom abandoned us. I absolutely love that I was raised by my dad!   Now that I am an adult and raising my own children and I reflect on my upbringing these are a few areas that I would suggest a dad pay extra attention to as they may not come to mind.   My father raised me like I was a boy with all the wonderful freedom, communication style, outlook, etc. That goes along with that. I never heard “girls can’t do that”. I was pushed and encouraged to do everything and challenge myself. I also didn’t inherit any negative body image issues from my mother (like many young girls do). I didn’t have a mom fussing about herself in the mirror saying things like “my thighs are fat” or “my tits are saggy”. I have no issues with food as either. No mom to witness always going on and off of diets. It never occurred to me to not like my body. In the same line of thinking because I was raised like a boy some of my manners were lacking and I had NO idea how to take care of my hair or dress for special occasions.   I learned all of those things on my own with much trial and error as I got older.   So I kindly suggest:   *Hair - A girls hair and it’s upkeep is important . There are tons of YouTube videos. It doesn’t have to be fancy but knowing how to properly comb long hair, condition, de tangle, ponytail and braid would be a good set of tools. If you aren’t into doing that a good stylist (doesn’t have to be expensive ) for a trim and upkeep every few months or so.   *My all time favorite book for parents of girls is Women Don’t Ask. Actually this book is great for anyone related to or that interacts with girls.   *This May have just been my father who is kinda old skool and traditionally masculine....he didn’t know how to deal with emotions. I got a lot of the “man up”, “don’t cry” tools for dealing with emotions. There are a whole range of emotions and better tools for dealing with them than that. A book that really helped me was Raising Caine - emotional lives of boys. It’s a book geared towards raising emotionally resilient boys but the methods/tools work well for kids, adults, boys and girls.   *Dont worry about replacing their mom. You don’t have to. If you love them, are consistent, and emotionally available they will get enough tools from you to be live fulfilling lives.   *Dont feel like you need to remarry or date and have a woman around just so your daughters have a female influence in their lives. I preferred when my Dad wasn’t in a relationship because I got all of his attention and we had a wonderful time together. The couple of times that he did date the women felt like they needed to swoop in and change everything about me and our lives. It wasn’t in a helpful way either. After a couple of relationships like that my dad saw it wasn’t helping me so he did t date until I was much older. I appreciate the time that I had with just us.   *If you are interested in having the girls get a dose of feminine energy there are always ballet classes, Girl Scouts, or other clubs, etc. aimed at girls.   Good luck! :)   Edit: stupid autocorrect 
As someone who’s dad just recently passed when he was young, I’m glad you are making a conscious choice to be there for the long haul. Realizing I won’t get to see my dad as I grow into a man, makes me incredibly sad. You will be Superman to these girls, and that’s something to cherish above everything. 
That soy grin! Are you sure you didn't just get a nintendo switch?
I’m telling you man, these kiddos complete my life. Before I had kids, I was seriously depressed, to the point of not even wanting to be around. I had given up.   They completely turned my life around and make every day worth living. I love them more than anything on this planet.   If the biological had actually tried to fight me on custody, I would have shaken the heavens till god himself sent me a lawyer to keep them. hahahahaha. 
> Long days but short years   > -  Gretchen Rubin   That's going on the wall  edit: Put the original source of the quote  in there
This reply gives me so much hope.. thank you for sharing.
Doing my best. One day at a time!!
Not sure if she knows it means “I love you”, cause she always says “rock and roll” when she does it hahaha. I assume she thinks it the metal sign but it’s so cute I don’t correct her. 
No. U. 
Man, you just made me tear up. I’m sorry for your loss. Stay strong. If you ever need anyone to chat with, hit me up. 
We basically just grew apart, she had her reasons, and they’re hers (I try not to bad mouth her, cause nothing good comes of it anyway). She moved a couple of hours away and still video chats with them every few days and comes to visit every other month or so. That’s about all she does though. 
The pic does them no justice. I smile every time I see them cause they’re the most beautiful things on the planet. 
I guess it's true what they say; aburst of DNA a day keeps the shrink away 
It only takes a moment to become a biological father, it takes a lifetime to be dad.
"Ha! The signs are often confused.  I love you is all three fingers like what she has  Put in the thumb and it's ""rock and roll""  Leave the thumb out but bring in the pointer finger and it's ""hang loose""   ;)"
That made me laugh real hard hahahahah
As a person who was adopted by my stepdad since my bio dad was just never ever there thank you for saying this. 
Not necessarily. If you knew the situation you’d understand. Sometimes the father is the best choice. Courts have progressed over the years and they really only care about what is best for the kids, not if the custodial parent is male or female.   I do consider myself lucky, though. Just for having them in my life. 
"Pull in the pinky and it's just her finger and her thumb in the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead"
Not voluntarily, no. I’m about $4k behind in daycare this year, but luckily my daycare lady understands and is willing to work with me. She’s the real mvp. I’ll prolly pay the majority back with my tax refund next year. With the divorce final, the state will start garnishing her paycheck and I’ll get around $500 a month (which I had lowered from $800, so she could still feed herself, and not have to live on the street). 
"My bio dad isn't horrible but he's just not a dad to me. His third wife was jealous of any attention he gave me so he eventually just cut me or of his life completely. My ""stepdad"" has been in my life as a father figure since before he married my mom when I was 8. He has no biological kids of his own. I called him by his first name up until a few years ago on fathers day when I gave him a card that said, ""Happy father's day to the man who could have just been my stepfather but chose to be my dad."" He and I both bawled like babies and I have called him ""dad"" ever since. He is my rock. Just thought I'd share my happy story."
Your daycare woman is a saint!  So nice.  It’ll be great to be able to start paying her back.
I think you're on to something there..
Real talk, I wish you and your 'little monsters' the best, now and in the coming years.   The road ahead will not easy, I saw my dad raise two boys by himself and he damn-near worked himself to into an early grave trying to provide for us. Please, don't let the stress turn you into someone that you're not.   Maybe this doesn't apply to you but I wanted to say it. Thanks and have a good day
Hahaha!  Found it.  At first I thought it was an ad of some sort.  Then read the title and realized that it's a real post.  I love reddit but mostly just lurk and have only commented a few times.  Some of the comments in here are hilarious.  I actually didn't giggle when I saw this but I did tear up.  I love my wife so much.  Yes, I married up in life.  18 years and counting.  Here's to more giggles and laughs with my love.  Thanks Reddit for all the kind and hilarious words!
It’s weird to be scrolling along Reddit on your lunch break and see someone you know but haven’t seen in like 15 years on the front page  
Im jealous.   I’m going to show my wife this post and she’s going to roll her eyes at me. Then she’s going to say something along the lines of “You and your fucking reddit.”  That’s how our reddit experience together usually plays out.   EDIT: I love my wife. 
I look like your husband and I'm about to go on a date with a girl that looks like you and it keeps getting stuck in my head that she's way out of my league. This gives me hope.  Made me /r/happy  (Not saying her husband is ugly, just saying wouldn't expect a bigger guy like that to land a petite cutie. Meant no offense to either of them. He is definitely not ugly. Also, thanks to everyone wishing me luck.)
Would like to see the reaction video of this when it happens
"Isn't one of Reddit site rules ""don't ask for votes"" or don't engage in vote manipulation ? "
Why are half you even in this subreddit if you're just gonna be negative.
Your husband hit the jackpot. Lucky punk.
Isn't it against the rules to ask for votes or ask for help to get to the front page?
I wish I could downvote this a million times tbh
cant down vote this stupid shit enough. 
18 years?!
Ladies and Gentlemen... here he is! My super hunky shrek Hubby!!!! 💙💙💙 found it before he got home! 
Do i know you?
Hey we doooo know each other 👋🏼
*Your weird internet people*  tbh she's not entirely wrong...
Get out there and charm the fuck out of her, lad. That's a direct order. 
Lmao low-key rude af 
Haha he will giggle like a girl! Or like he is watching panda videos😂 I will certainly try to capture it! 😊
Not anymore. 
When posts get upvotes they become more visible to people outside the sub. 
It's annoying to see a picture of literally nothing except two random bozos faces at the top of reddit?  
Please OP, share the secret of your eternal youth with the rest of us!
Seriously? Did they marry at 12? 
what the fuck
Yes
When you two sort this out, we are certainly expecting story time here. Hope it’s not a shitty ex or something. 
Can't believe the guy made a post like that and then just friggin disappeared lmao edit: ah it was only like 10 mins tho     
Like, you might genuinely not care, but the vast majority of people care greatly about looks. I wish people would stop telling others it doesn't matter how you look. It does, a lot. If you look like hot shit, people are going to trip over themselves tryna be with you. Get in that gym, cut the fast food, dress better and you are going to have a shitload more success in dating and less heartache.
Here from /r/all can confirm
Bacon 😂
17 & 21
Drumroll please!
*sings* Now she's just somebody that you used to know!!
Wow this is so weird, I'm her husband's husband!
Sorry, I had to go back to work! 
Do.. do I eat it? Put it on my face before bed? Bacon Fat Colonic?! is that kosher?
It's only illegal in some states!
Hold on! Let me run some calculations....  That would mean you're 35 and hubby is 39?? 
*** du dum tsss ***
You math well! 
Needs more cowbell, boss.
Blink blink blink
That is such a beautiful, awesome smile! You are a survivor and nothing can keep you down! Stay strong <3 
Oh my heck you guys, you made me happy cry in line for security at the airport!! I tried to respond to every single comment, especially ones by other survivors, but alas my phone died. I wanted to thank you all so much and let you know I am thinking of you and so incredibly grateful there is such good in the world!! Please, all have an incredible evening/day for me, and if that’s too much, have an amazing hour for me.   Stay strong, and have a wonderful holiday season reddit! Love, Tori :,)
Until I was sexually assaulted, I never would have realized how much you would associate the clothing with what happened.   It is never simple to process something like this, but it does get easier, and you will continue to get better. It's amazing how far you've come in just three months; you should be very proud of yourself!
The Japanese have a concept they call *kintsugi*, where, when a bowl or plate(all pottery, really) is chipped or broken, rather than deem it worthless and discard it, they use a special gold-powdered lacquer to repair the piece. This repair method celebrates each artifact’s unique history by emphasizing its fractures and breaks instead of hiding or disguising them. *Kintsugi* often makes the repaired piece even more beautiful than the original, revitalizing it with new life.   That’s what I see in your smile. You are a fearless warrior woman, rising like a phoenix from the ashes of your pain. The world is yours to conquer. 
Seriously, I thought you were talking about wearing the hat...  And I now realize I’m a huge idiot...  Glad you’re feeling better!
This is my sister. I’ve held onto the dress for her so she wouldn’t have to see it until she was ready. I’ve been so proud of her for how much she’s changed for the better because of this awful experience. She’s just as strong as you all think :)   And for anyone dealing with something similar,  being strong doesn’t mean you can’t cry. She’s called in tears more times than I can count, at all hours. But what makes her strong is that she keeps going through the tears. I love you, sis!
Iam happy for you and your progress with such thing! 
IM SO FUCKING PROUD OF YOU, YOU SUNSHINEY BITCH. 
Positivity is 10 times Stronger than negativity. Remember that 🙏
Thank you so much, it was a birthday gift! Haha, get it? ;)   But for real, I truly appreciate that! It’s been a lot of pain and effort but now I feel invincible!!
It’s crazy right?! so much significance for a piece of fabric. I remember when i would cry even seeing it hidden away. Now look at me!!   It’s actually been a year and three months, but still i feel like it’s good progress. I know it’ll never be the same, but i know it will be even better.   We can do this! I’m proud of you!! 
I love that!! It’s so beautiful and incredibly true. I may not have wanted it, but it has changed me for the better. Being open to change is what life is all about!! :)
Can you please enlightening a fellow idiot that still thinks it's the hat? 
Lord, let’s hope that for all of us, brother!!
love you crow you’re just ok. 
Thank you so much!! I now no longer feel like a victim, but instead I am a survivor!
lowkey this is my fav comment 
I’m stealing that birthday gift line.. sorry in advance 
male victim here, i know how you feel. You got this girl, you got this. (fist bump)
"One of the most important things I've realized while recovering from trauma and mental health issues is how dangerous it is to want to get back to some idealized ""normal"" or how you were before. There is no end goal you can reach and then stop at; a healthy ""normal"" looks like you working to get better, and better, and better "
I’m guessing a smile.
It’s a dress which she has on underneath. She explained in another comment. Confusing, I know.
it’s cool, that’ll be $7.99
oh man, being a male victim is so hard. I’m so sorry. This isn’t much but take an upvote and know I’m keeping you in my heart :)
My sister hid it away so that one day, when I was ready, i’d be able take back the dress and metaphorically take back my freedom, as i did today! she explained it somewhere on the thread, u/kurocrowi 
Well fuck even after reading the comment about the beautiful smile it still didn't click until now.  
I’ve only got tree fiddy...
As a father who raised four kids on my own and as a stand-in dad for twenty-six young men and women over the years, I want you to know I'm proud of you, OP.  Whatever their reasons, you're valuable and worthy of love, but sometimes parents aren't the people *they* should be.  Keep being you, keep being happy, and love will fill your world.
Who the *fuck* actually disowns their kid? I'm sorry you gotta go through that OP. No judgement. I hope you continue doing really well! Great job!
Woah, really wasn’t expecting this to blow up, but I appreciate all the love! Thank you!  EDIT: I’m reading through most of the comments, and I really appreciate all of the kindness. It feels good to know people out there care enough to comment. I am, however, not going to comment on what happened with my family out of respect for their privacy.   EDIT 2: I want to add to anyone in a similar situation: I’ve found love and support in some amazing places and through wonderful people. There’s always a silver lining and care from people even when it feels like there’s no one in the world on your side... and I think that this post is a perfect example of that. 
You go girl! You got this. 
This picture gives off such good vibes that I’m in a better mood now. Super proud of you and keep that uplifting attitude of yours! 
I will totally be your honorary sister if you need one!
As a mom with a house full of dudes, I’d love a daughter that is self sufficient, upbeat and beautiful. Their loss, surround yourself with good people. 
Life is rarely fair or easy,  i know as i had to cut off my toxic family entirely years ago. Strive to live your best life,  fight for something worth having,  find friends who support you and stand behind you always.  Contrary to popular belief family isn't blood,  it's the people you choose to have in your life, who are there for you.   It sounds like you're on the right path,  just as a warning though remember whether it's family or friends only let people in your life that enrich it, the rest? Well they have no place in it.
As someone who was also disowned, good fucking job woman. You're killing it. (:  I also know it can be really difficult to deal with at times, so if you ever need someone to talk or vent to feel free to PM me.
Good for you too man. And very good advice. 
I love you
>Who the fuck actually disowns their kid?  Homophobic parents, for once. Not implying that OP is lgbt but parents reacting that way sadly happens far too often. 
What do you think of the new detective Pikachu trailer?
I'm humbled.  Thank you.
Know what, /u/alhe80?  I love you right back.
"Yeah, I mean... I get it. Like, the reasons (however unfortunate) that it happens but my question was more in the vein of ""WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU CAN'T JUST DO THAT! THAT'S YOUR KID YOU DOUCHE CANOE!"" directed towards the parents. "
I was disowned for reporting my childhood sexual abuser. My mom knew but he owned the house we all lived in so she didn't do anything at all. It went on for 10 years. I eventually realised that I wasn't the one in the wrong for wanting to report and so I did, and I was promptly exiled. Ngl, I haven't quite managed to get to the point brave OP has yet. I'm really struggling so this post is inspiring.

PLEASE RESPECT HER FAMILY’s PRIVACY
This! I have told my son everyday since he was born that my love for him is absolutely unconditional. No matter if he's gay, straight or trans. No matter the religion. No matter his career.  As a parent, YOU decided to bring them into the world. They didn't ask you to. You don't bring kids into this world to force them into a mold you created and then reject them when they don't conform. If your beliefs tell you to do so, you need new fucking beliefs. Love your babies people. No matter who they are.  Edit:  Thanks for the platinum, fellow Redditor!  I'm grateful that so many have as much love to give as myself.  My faith in humanity just went up a notch. 💓
What if they pronounce gif, jif though?  
That's where I draw the line! I won't associate with anyone that pronounces gif incorrectly.   /s
did you pm your booty?
Clever PR stunt to get that username some action... We're on to you u/PM__ME___UR__BOOTY  Seriously though that's awesome man! Have a great birthday.
Thats extremely kind of that user!  This makes me feel happy as well!
Fr though, try to find a local food bank. They're there for this exact situation
I think u/PM__ME___UR__BOOTY deserves some booty pm'd to him.  Edit: hey I wouldn't mind some booty too btw :)
Aw, reminds me of old reddit and /r/randomactsofpizza  edit: I guess the new sub is called /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza
r/humansbeingbros
Good ol' BOOTY
August birthday? Where you held back a year or did you make the cut off for the school year? So many of my friends are basically the same age as me (July) but had to be placed one grade below me because of the age cut off and I can't imagine how frustrating that would be, especially if it were only by a week or so. 
No other way to get bread. 
Seriously. OP is definitely cute enough to make some cash that way. 
The man has been on Reddit for a year and has 36 karma. I don’t think he cares about PR lol 
Plot twist, he's actually the same person, and it's all a scheme to get more booty!
Wish this reply was higher up!  He could probably also get better nutrition than pizza and soda.
Definitely, looking at his account it’s not the only pizza he’s gifted
I was younger than all of my classmates. Pretty annoying that I was the last to be able to drive or buy alcohol but hey, they’ll be dead first
Coulda just pm’d his breadstick and meatballs.
Strong username to comment ratio.  
With a name like that I'd say it's likely he has another account or two. 
It's his birthday!
>He could probably also get better nutrition than pizza and soda  Foodbank user in the UK here, that's rather doubtful. While you get food to feed you, it usually not the most balanced or nutritionally rich.  However, it keeps you alive / going so I have no complaints.  edit...Always used to be a food snob. However, you'd be amazed how great tesco value tinned curry tastes after 2 days without being able to afford food...
holy shit this guy is a pizza gifting fiend
[Breadstick and meatballs](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/sGIlO)
Well you would know about that, u/Vladimirs__Poutine, wouldn't you.
We all deserve to eat pizza for our birthdays. It's a happy day dammit!
But the question is: do you have to PM your booty to earn pizza?
Risky click at work. 
Yep this is my third account. I don't use them concurrently. It's just nice to get a new name sometimes, a name people like. 
Especially when the guy has a username like that
I can get behind that
Get behind me.
Big time congrats man! That is dedication and determination I can't even fathom. Time to make the big bucks to pay back those student loans. 😁
Congrats. Does it usually take that long to become a surgeon? 
I love you in westworld
That is incredibly impressive. You put in more time learning a career than some people spend IN a career. 
Patagonia vest over scrubs so you know it’s real
Congratulations! I imagine it took many sleepless nights & questioning if it was really worth the many years of schooling!? But look at you, saving lives and shit. How awesome is that. Wishing you all the best in your future, Doc! :) you should be very proud of yourself for all of your hard work and dedication. 
Taking my MCAT in 12 hours. Good job and thank you for the inspiration! 
Imagine the size of the student loans after 13 fucking years! dedication and determination truly are the right words.. congrats so much OP!
I know it's cliche'd to say this, but you really can't do this for big bucks. It's too long, too hard and too stressful. It's just who they are. My mentors tell me of Maxillofacial surgeons they know that do 14 hour long procedures without a break. On their feet, without food. The students watching them pass out from exhaustion while they keep working. They are a whole different level of human being. Even for all the respect surgeons get with the title, I still think it's less than they deserve.
There are a few faster routes, but I did the most traditional, and did a year of research. The quickest you can get from college to heart surgery is 10 years. 
I like to imagine when he got his certification the Patagonia magically sprouted onto his body.
Even at the end, I still question if it was worth it. I lost my 20s and half my 30s working 100 or more hours a week. I missed most holidays. It's not for the faint of heart, or faint of butt. 
I'll save that GD deer. 
I did residency with a guy who started when he was 42. It’s definitely not the norm, but not impossible. 
I can very much imagine them. Very much.
As a potential future heart patient I'd prefer a surgeon who didn't take the fast route. 
I have so much respect for that. 100 hours a week? That is some serious work ethic.
You know what they call the person who was the bottom of the class in medical school? Doctor.
Nope, not even a little bit upset about how much doctors make. They study their craft for, in this case, over a decade, sometimes longer, and are charged with literally keeping people from dying. If anyone deserves to make what they make it's them.   Besides, there's plenty of other people out there who make way more who don't benefit society as much as doctors to rag on.
A doctor will make between $200k and $750k per year, depending on the speciality. Surgeons like OP can break the million barrier, depending on speciality.  In 2016, Zuckerberg made $13 million per DAY. That's nothing compared to the $41 million per DAY Bill Gates made, though.  I think there are people who make too much money, but it's not medical professionals. 
I third this!  Take your time, Doc.
Yeah. I have a friend that, for a very long time, was convinced that Africa was a country. She's in medical school now. 
If anything, a lot of doctors aren't compensated nearly as much as they should be, considering the dedication it takes to get their education, the hours they work, and the stressful nature of the job.    It's kinda sad to consider that the highest paid doctors are likely plastic surgeons performing purely cosmetic work on the rich rather than people like OP and his colleagues who've dedicated upward of a decade of their life simply to learn how to help others, and are rewarded with mediocre pay, long hours, and a shite ton of debt.
You need to know biology and chemistry to get into med school, no one said anything about geography!  Speaking as a med student, we're supposed to be good at critical thinking and memorizing science stuff, we can be pretty thick when it comes to anything else.  Hell, I still have no idea if the sun rises in the east or the west or northwest or what, and my roommate has to make an L with his left hand to tell left from right. Future doctors everybody!
I think plastic surgeons get a bad rep..  much of their work also consists of reconstruction of faces/skin and other body parts for burn victims and other trauma patients. It’s not limited to vanity.. I would give them some more credit
">my roommate has to make an L with his left hand to tell left from right. Future doctors everybody!  ""Doctor, I think it should be the other kidney...""  ""We're operating on the left kidney, right?""  ""That's the right kidney.""  ""But it's the patient's left.""  ""No, that's the patient's right.""   "
Good job man! 
Damn, my best friend is a Reddit celebrity? 
man, i am absolutely blown away by the support y'all have shown me here. thank you all so, so much- you really have no idea how much your encouragement and thoughts mean to me. i wasn't being hyperbolic when i said that i'm the luckiest man in the world. i made a lot of awful decisions for a long, long time yet somehow have survived, and if this bedraggled idiot can come back from the brink after all that, anyone can. it does get better. it may suck for a long time, and that suck will often find ways to suck more, but at some point you will learn to manage it if you keep trying.  if it would be well-received, i would like to perhaps do an AMA. i have lived such a bizarre and hilariously troubled life that if i do one thing for future generations of aspiring fuck-ups it needs to be to share my story and hopefully dissuade some folks from following in my footsteps. or at the very least illustrate the perils of living that kind of life.
Congrats dude, looking good! I'm glad you're happy and sober now. 
Awesome job.  Its so inspiring to see people turn their lives completely around!
I thought this was an r/SkincareAddiction post at first. You look great! What kind of music do you play?
From eyes that are lost to eyes that are determined.
thanks man! the support i get from those who have seen where i've been and where i'm at is nothing short of incredible. i should post my story sometime- enjoyed a decade of heavy drug use, lost a leg to a shotgun accident, did some time in state prison, lived under a bridge, lost everything i ever owned, alienated my loved ones yet somehow i'm still here. successful, content and surrounded by people who truly love me. i am without a doubt the luckiest man to walk the earth.
You bet your bippy he is
I'd love to see an AMA. I think your story's important.
thank you! i play mostly death/black metal, tend to stay on florida-ish death metal but i do enjoy drone quite a bit as well
This is a story I could definitely enjoy reading
Man I'm going through a pretty rough time right now but seeing stuff like this definitely helps keep me from breaking down.
/r/drugs would love your stories
Went from actual Rasputin to the slick Rasputin from Hellboy
You look like Steve carell
Seriously, he should write a book
Agree with guy above. It gets better.  Step 1 want to get better Step 2 try to get better Step 3 fail Step 4 repeat steps 2&3 until you skip steps 3&4 Step 5 be better
i'm going to frame this quote and put it on my wall
kind of surprised my acne hasn't formed an inverted crucifix by now tbh
Congrats on the house! Keep going!! Also enjoy that pizza, looks good 
Moving on and moving up! Wishing all of the best to you! 
I know you probably won't see this in the barrage of messages in your inbox but I just wanted to say,   After going through hell, i was raised by a single mom in a crappy situation too. And we did have a bout of homelessness and my mom white knuckled the hell out of it, but through it all, as a kid who has been there and seen the struggle and had a mom who did her best-- I just want you to know its nights like tonight we remember.  We don't spend our adulthood looking back at the nights we slept huddled together in a tent or a car or popup camper, or how sad we were to leave schools and friends behind. We dont look back and feel jipped or let down, and I know that's a fear my mom probably holds.   We remember her coming home from a road trip to a successful interview and we sat half in and half out of our camper at 10pm sharing  chicken nuggets and laughing at the sheer sillyness of mom to wake us all up to celebrate with McDonalds.  We remember all of our new houses, and with a huge and loving warmth, the last one we get as a family. We remember divvying up rooms and when mom let us pick out a paint swatches and painting bunnies and random stuff before mom rolled it all over in solid colors.  When we moved to our finally family home, we had pizza too. From the same place we order from all the time, even if its not the greatest, when we visit home the nostalgia makes it the best.   I wish I could tell my mom that my childhood memories aren't painted in the colors of her struggles, but rather all the love there was.   My moms a fucking superhero, and I wouldn't change a single choice she made for us.   But she also would hate all this touchy feely crap :P 
I can't wait for this.  I can relate to having a struggle and having to overcome it to get to a safe place.  Congrats!  I'll save this so I can see it when I need to keep going.  Edit: i kind of felt alone before I posted this and thank you. I’m humbled that people connected with this.
"I cried just reading the title. I've spent the last dozen years trying to avoid the hell you've been going through. In that time I was laid off five times, by five different companies. Not fired, just laid off because fuck our economy and fuck Wall Street and fuck people who are bitching about not being able to buy the yacht in the color they wanted while people starve in the streets. Being a single dad of a child with a chronic illness is hard, but harder when landlord after landlord were not necessarily bad people, but just incompetent and weak and cheap. One even got the request to fix an issue that drastically impacted my kids health and just shrugged and said ""if I were you I'd look for better accommodations."" I've had to move nine times in 12 years, and finally landed in a place last month that is clean, and safe, and has a good landlord who gives a shit.  Through all that there were a few times when I've been within a day or less from being flat-out homeless, and it was only by several not so minor miracles and the goodness of friends that kept food in our bellies and a roof over our heads. I've worked in homeless shelters so I know how little help there is for people who are struggling.   From the bottom of my heart: congratulations. You're not alone. It does get better. And you are the BEST kind of mom, even when you don't feel like you are. Just don't give up. Hugs. "
Proud of ya. Enjoy your holidays :)
Thank you! Just congrats from a stranger and I want to cry. I’m so so happy. 
Thank you so much 
Then tell her she’s a Fucking Superhero! That’s not touchy-feely. Don’t not say anything, you’ll regret it if you do!
It’s mind boggling to me that I’m someone’s inspiration now (however indirect). Thank you so much, and yes it’s all about focus on the goal. 
Thank you kindly
YOU ARE SO STRONG!!!   You did it. You beat the bad. You got to good.  These are milestones and confidence builders and keep building!   Love to you and you kid Ms. :)   Now take half a day to yourself and take a deserved and needed break and breather.  Heal a tad, dont slow down but just take the foot off the gas for just a sec and let yourself enjoy, reap reward and success and recharge! 
also feel free to send me a short christmas list for your kid — i just got a promotion and i’d love to pay it forward. ♥️ 
Look at money bags over here with a bath tub.   Congrats!
Is this your first bath? I recommend taking your clothes off when bathing, it is more effective. 
Congratulations!! You look so happy ☺
If only I saw **off** the first time reading, it would have saved me some confusion. Good for you though!
Wife and I lived in a very old house, our first home, with only one small bathroom and a stand-up shower on a different floor than our bedroom. We could just never get the money together to redo it and get a tub. After 8 loooong years we finally decide it's time to move. Now we have a master bedroom with an attached bathroom and tub with a 2nd bathroom with a tub! Oh man, the simple pleasure of a bathtub, never thought I'd miss it that much. I feel you- that smile you have, we have it now, too.
Honest question... if employment is so unstable, why would you commit to buying a house?
Next thing you know, we'll be hearing about her fancy fridge and microwave that she looks at while eating avocado toast.
I'm washin' me an my clothes
And a little tired. :) But we did it! And thank you!
I nearly cried when I walked into this master bath for the first time. Stand-up shower with room for a bench, separate bath tub, two sinks AND a separate vanity, walk-in closet with shelves for shoes, and a separate toilet closet so I don't have to watch my husband poop!
From a comment further down by OP [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8620o1/after_getting_laid_off_twice_in_six_months_and/dw1xcpx/) >Nope, sorry if it wasn't clear. Laid off in Dec. 2016. Hired Feb. 2017. Laid off June 2017. Hired again (job I didn't like in new city, but it was a paycheck) Sept. 2017. Quit that one for the better job in Oct. 2017!   So she's only been at her current job since October...man I hope it works out for her.
I thought you couldn’t have both a house and avocado toast.... 
r/frugal
That’s only according to Dave Ramsey ^I’ve ^never ^eaten ^avocado ^toast ^^and ^^I ^^don’t ^^have ^^a ^^house ^^^am ^^^I ^^^doing ^^^this ^^^right?
First, be open to change. If/when you get laid off or get rejected or hit some other speed bump, allow yourself about 12-24 hours to wallow, and then work, work, work. I treated job-hunting like its own full-time job. I applied for at least a job a day, depending on how much the job required (cover letters, work samples, etc). Really beef up your LinkedIn profile, post samples of your work if applicable (I'm a writer so I posted a lot of my articles). When you find something you really love, unleash your inner detective and find the hiring manager, or someone close to them at the company, and SEND COLD EMAILS AS A COVER LETTER. Every interview I got, it was because I had done the extra bit of research to find an email address.
Every Dad aspires for their dad jokes to always be funny. Congratulations! You won. 
Wow. Since this blew up I’ll add two facts:  1) It started as a 2 min routine but I’m forbidden to mix up the order or skip anything so anytime I improvise something it’s now a permanent addition to the show.  2) Right when I get home from work he starts planning it out with me. There are a couple of elements that are variable like how many of the non-standard animals will sneak in.  So he wants me to tell him how many “sneaks” there will be tonight. He thinks it’s hilarious if there are a different number than what he his expecting that try and sneak in to be part of the show. 
The only thing that tops his YouTube videos is his parenting skills. You’re the best mark!
Thanks for taking such good care of him! Lots of us autistic people get abused as kids. He looks so happy.
I had no idea you were a father, Mark, but I'm glad you have such a great relationship with your boy! I know your son is just as happy as you are and has a great dad to look up to.
Great picture....and i'd guess it's his favorite part of the day too. 
I understand this. My 13 year old has autism and our bedtime routine hasn't changed in a decade.   It's hard to explain how wonderful those 15 minutes are. There can be so much turmoil in a day, but we always end well. For a kid who struggles to connect and and understand other people, for us both to have that time where there are no questions, it's really awesome.   
Yeah, from another habitual dad-joker to another, congrats! You make your son happy everyday.
Looks like mark rober
My dad has been doling out dad jokes since forever and has always been met by rolled eyes and groans from my mum, brother, and me.  Then my SO came into my life and I discovered that she will *crack up* at awful dad jokes.  My dad will now invite us over for dinner, to play tennis, etc at every opportunity because he's found the audience he never had his whole life.  I genuinely think he likes her company more than mine but I'm cool with it because it makes him so happy.
You've got a great attitude man - adding all that extra time ongoing like that might frustrate some, but you're handling it like a champ. Your son is going to grow up great. 
As someone on the spectrum who has a bedtime routine even now at almost 30, good for you for playing along! My routine usually involves me kissing my husband repeatedly and saying 'I love you' until I feel like we've said it enough that if one of us dies neither will regret not saying it more. Did it as a kid, never grew out of it. I was lucky to have parents like you that played along too!
Not sure who’s downvoting your comment, but have my upvote buddy. You seem like a really great guy 👍🏻
For those who haven't seen, he has an awesome [YouTube Channel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg)
My daughter is autistic and my bestest friend. I can't fathom why anyone could abuse any kid. It broke my heart when she was first diagnosed but I learned how to think like her and she begin to improve in certain areas. It's hard sometimes but I could never hurt my best friend.
Hi, habitual dad-joker, I'm sk33tshot.
Pretty sure that is mark rober 
Relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/791/). 
I’ve recorded one of the nights on video. He watches that when I’m on travel on my wife’s phone. 
I thought he looked like Mark.
Oh hi Mark.
Right on man! Keep it up. 
Are you looking into becoming a private franchiser? We have a family near us that own several McDonald's and they are veeery successful!
Is that a university where they teach you how to make hamburgers?  Serious question.  Like, is it to get a promotion at maccas?
Thanks for all the support everyone! Super excited to hear from all of you! :p its 4am here so ill replay to some of you when I wake up and on my commute to work! Tootles for now!!! <3 the reddit family!
Don’t give up, you’re worth so much! 
That's awesome dude! Good for you!
Will try! <3
$500,000 cash in hand to apply for the franchise. Each store. My franchise owner has 6 stores. I dont know if ill ever own my own store but, skies the limit!
Im going for whats call OTP 3 training (Operations Technical Person), level 2 is online, level 1 is also online. After I graduate from Level 3 I can go for OTM (Operations Technical Manager) training. This training is basically the ins and outs of every piece of technology across the board inside of a McDonald’s store. From Point of Sales systems, down to the camera’s outside and the Automatic Beverage Server. It covers it all.  However, Hamburger University also provides training for Department Managers, which there are generally three departments in each store, and GM’s. The departments are Guest Services, People (internal employees), and Grill. There is online training for each department but if your store really likes you, you can go to training in chicago as well. GM courses follow the same pattern.  Ever sense I watched a YouTube video when I was a little kid (like 13, im 26 now) I always wanted to go! It’s been a dream and if I keep this up Im going! :p
Thanks! <3 i love everyones support! You all are awesome!
You’ve got this! Don’t give up! We’re all rooting for you! 
I have a similar story. I started at the age of 12, until I was 24 years old.   At the age of 24 I had to go to jail for 4 months, from that day on I am drug free. For over 5 years now. Have a wonderful son and a wonderful wife, very good job and again a very good relationship with my family.   Everything is possible, you just have to be determined. Well done, I know how you feel :)
“Do or Do not. There is no try” - Master Yoda
Well once you achieve your first dream of going to Hamburger University, you're going to need a new dream! Despite all you've gone through, you're about to reach that fist goal, so I have no doubts that you'll be able to reach the next!
Dude, you overcame an 8 year drug addiction. Can you think of anything more powerful than something that would make you steal from the people who love you, sink to lows you never thought you were capable of and totally disregard everything that should be important? You beat one of the toughest things in the world.  Your next opponent is a frail weakling no matter what it is.
Is it actually called Hamburger University? 
Hey man, find out what’s up with the ice cream machine while you’re there.
Yes![Hamburger University YouTube Video (CNNMoney)](https://youtu.be/sICEmBpAPq0) 
Man I love reddit. I doubt I would found out about this any other way.   More importantly: GO YOU! I hope you do swell over there.
Hear ya on the lovin reddit! Its my new favorite addiction!!!
I found Reddit roughly right around the time I kicked H (a few years ago now!) and this is too true lol. 
Almost a decade later for me and I still do that shit Welcome to the road my friend
Congrats on getting your license!!
Welcome to adult life! 🌮🚙
I felt this
Probably one of the best posts here I've seen. Congrats man
I just got a car and I did exactly this! Congratulations on your license :) 
Mine was Burger King, must be a rite of passage.
Why so many front-page posts about Taco Bell today?
I love random drives and fast food. I'm 32. 
Never mind that, congrats on the Taco Bell!  > *hungry British guy who is 2h drive from the nearest crunchwrap supreme*
This is the peak!
For real. As silly as it sounds, a huge wave of nostalgia swept over me when I saw this. I can FEEL the memories of sitting in Taco Bell parking lots late at night with friends just shooting the shit. Some of the best nights of my life. 
greetings humans i am lord gyreeéeio from planet z$boo and i too enjoy midnight runs to the nearest substance facility. i am 673,000 years old. 
That's a double triple crunchwrap -A tacobell employee
Very true. I remember the day I got my liscence I just went on a joy ride with no destination, just jamming to the radio in bliss. Life has been miserable ever since. 
I find it interesting that despite being from another planet you still use Latin based characters. Also, is that earth years or z$boo years?
He just ran it through Google translate.
Congrats! I’m also curious which church?
Welcome to Charlotte, friend. 
Good for you!  And don't sweat it, 22 is not even slightly too old to be in University and putting your life together. You'll take ass and kick names! Or something like that anyway.
"Trying to reply to all of you but I have work tonight until modnight, and then I have to wake up and go straight back to work tomorrow at 8am. Will be back at approximately 4pm EST tomorrow.   Edit: thank you for upvoting for visibility. Also, front page for a bit? Holy shit! The support and friendship and love I have received from all of you is simply overwhelming. Leaving behind the church (and my entire fucking life in the process; the church was my life) has been desperately lonely and I cannot describe how good it feels to finally have some people on my side again. Thank you, reddit. I wish I could gild all your comments or buy you all a beer. But I'll do my best to just respond to all of you instead <3  Edit2: again, you guys are amazing. Over 1k of top-level comments is just too much for me to reply to, though :( I will scroll through and try to answer all of your questions, and know that I appreciate every single comment that says ""you look happy"" or ""congratulations"". PM me if you have a question I missed.  Edit3: finally made it through all the top level comments. You guys are amazing. Again, PM me if I missed a question you had."
Wow! My first Reddit gold! I really hope this post gives people encouragement or even just lightens someone's day. 
Well done! And you've not entirely wasted your time, as that sort of enlightenment is worth a qualification on its own.
I’m so excited for you. I was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness. I loved school and my parents told me that after high school I was supposed to get married and be a full-time door-to-door minister. I left when I was 19 after coming out as gay. I was eventually able to go to university and I just graduated. Soak up every moment of your experience! I am so grateful I got to go to university and grow intellectually and personally. Congratulations! 
What cult following were you involved in? 
I've spent the last 20 years brainwashed by my own household and I've come to realize that I ain't moving nowhere if I stay here, finally got the guts to ask to move out and have my own life, didn't end up well because I ain't got no cash nor a friend's house to crash, still living in my parents' house at 20, still in the same uni with the same major I hate.. but I feel something's gonna change soon, I will work my arse off and try my best to leave this place it's suffocating. Congrats on your move! I'm happy that at least one of us got what he wanted, pray for me!
Escaping a cult is an amazing triumph!  Congratulations, and best of luck at school!
Mormon
Thank you frightened friendo. I knew it reminded me of NC, but I couldn’t place it.
I honestly think there's no age limit to change your life and gain knowledge. It's never too late to do what you want/love.
Dang dude, hope you get a break soon!  Hijacking my own comment to tell you I live near you.  Come to Fayetteville/Raeford and I'll fly you in our wind tunnel (Paraclete XP) for free if your looking for something to do mate. 
Thank you! I really think you're right but it's hard to measure that enlightenment. And so sometimes I still feel like I wasted my time. 
I was Mormon. Whether or not they're a cult is a question I don't want to deal with, but I do want to mention that even though my time there sucked, they never asked me to move to some remote place or kill myself. So they aren't that kind of cult. 
Knew it. Me too, bro.   Congrats on escaping.
Ex Jehovahs Witness Here. Grats dude, you made the right choice. It's not easy to turn your back on all that and live your life for yourself. 
Arr you an r/exmormon subscriber?
Like a helicopter 
Unfortunately when I came out of the closet they decided to disown me completely. Thankfully I’ve been able to find a new family in my friends. 
I was gonna ask too. I knew you were gonna say Mormon tho. 
"For me, ""working for them when I should have been getting an education"" made me immediately think of Mormon missions taking kids away from college. "
My friend got out when he was 18. His mom and dad still hate me and blame me for it lol.
"Escaping from the mind trap that is religion. Some of the smartest people I know still believe in the Mormon story. Because it all boils down to trusting your feelings from the Holy Ghost or trusting that you are not ""in tune"" with it (confirmation bias). It is very, very difficult, if not impossible for some people, to free their mind of it once they have spent their entire early life as part of it.  Mormons dedicate their whole perspective and many hours of their week to the church. In the temple, you promise to dedicate all of your time, your talents, everything you have, and everything you will have, to the building up of the church on the earth.  You are told that if you cannot keep ""impure"" sexual thoughts at bay, and even if you masturbate at all, you are committing a grievous sin. Incredible guilt that doesn't go away for 95+% of guys because of course they can't give it up despite their best efforts.  You are told and you believe that if you have doubts, you are in the wrong. You are told to never read anything contrary to what the church leaders share. Or that if you do you should then go get it cleared up by authorities rather than making up your mind based on the balance of evidence and history https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv3UdvcI21k  If you do not live up to your church promises, you will not be with your loved ones for eternity. You'll be a disappointment to everyone. And even if you no longer believe, your family will likely disown you or persecute you in many real ways. Some lucky people have understanding families, but if those families still believe, they will still never be okay with who you are, and will think you are damned and are a danger to them and their children.  If you want to hear how it was from actual (usually former) members, there are hundreds of them on the Mormon Stories project. Here are some that I found to be particularly touching:  [Thirteen Years of Silence: Matt Elggren & Clay Christensen](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/thirteen-years-of-silence-matt-elggren-clay-christensen/)  [Christine Jeppson Clark -- daughter of high-up ""general authority"" church leader](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/christine-jeppsen-clark-daughter-of-general-authority-malcolm-jeppsen/)  [Brent Metcalfe - scholar (this is probably my favorite of all)](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/brent-metcalfe-mark-hofmann-salamander-letter-bombings/)  [Tom Phillips - former mid-tier church leader who received the ""Second Anointing"" which is the highest, fairly secret ordinance done by the apostles. Also sent questions to his friend, Jeffrey R. Holland of the Twelve living apostles, and got back a useless non-answer that insults anyone's intellect](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/tom-phillips-and-the-second-anointing/)  [Family Ties: Doug, Lauria, Julie, and Jerry's Mormon Faith Crisis/Transition](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/family-ties/)"
Honestly. It’s the blonde hair, blue eyes, and that smile. Plus you look like you belong to a family of Mormons that I know.
Really?! I mean I look like a classic, stereotypical white boy, but I didn't know that meant Mormon. 
Yeah thankfully he got his youngest brother out too. His middle brother and older sister are still in it. The messed up part was his dad was a secret drunk and got kicked out of the church, but still acted so holy.
I'm getting a lot of messages calling me a slut, telling me to go kill myself. Wow.  Edit: I'm getting a lot of PMs right now, so I'll try to reply to as many as I can. Thank you so much for your kindness and hope. If you are struggling, please know that it gets better.   Edit 2: I'm going to log off for tonight. Happy new year everyone!
Well done, please don't ever damage that beautiful smile ...  You are a very lucky lady, and beautiful to boot !
Congratulations and happy new year!  Best wishes for another great year for you.  Keep up the optimism and hope.  Humans are extremely resilient and there is always someone willing to help you. I hope you have a fun and exciting year starting college or a dream job after you graduate.  Life is beautiful.  Thanks for sharing your hope with us.
Take care, stranger. 
How did you get better?
You are beautiful! Congratulations, you have so much to look forward to! ❤
This sub is weird. It used to be about people having just bought a new puppy, passed their exams or having had a kid or something like that. Now it‘s just a contest about who can sell how sad they were some time ago the best. Does this stuff seem disingenious to anyone else? I‘m glad all these people are doing fine now but all these near-suicide stories are more depressing than, well, happy.  I guess philosophically/psychologically happiness only exists in contrast to sadness but still, I feel like this sub should be about happiness first, not second.
Feel free to hit the report button so the mods will check it out. We attract a lot of trolls.
Ignore the trolls.  That's seriously not cool.
The internet is full of angry trolls.    There are people who follow the lure of these trolls and do hurt themselves. Disarm the trolls and be strong. 
Thank you! :)
When I realized I was suffering from depression, I told some friends and my family, which led to a lot of therapy, hospitalization, etc. Ultimately it was the realization that I absolutely hated the way I was living my life that made me choose to get better. I had hit an all time low and figured that after years of self-harm and detrimental behavior there must be something better to life. I started getting more involved in school activities and realized that I didn't have to live a bad life simply because I was dealt a hand of depression. I still have bad episodes but between healthy coping skills and support, I can get through them.
As far as I know, reporting messages as in PM's will only be seen by admins, not mods. But yeah if it's comments, those reports go to mods of that sub
Report the trolls. Can you imagine being that pathetic that your main hobby is to try to injure/upset total strangers online? It just boggles my mind. Some assholes need an anti-internet chip implanted, crikey. And congrats on your recovery OP!!
That's awesome, good for you! Thanks for the uplifting example to start off the new year after such a depressing 2017.
Should report anyway to get these people fucked off. 
It's hard to tell when depression or mental illness is hurting someone because it's not always obvious. That's why I think it's important to be aware that you never know what's happening for someone. 
Honestly, my experience with hospitalization wasn't great, but it eid help me realize how much more I appreciated my life at home. On the note of therapy, I've had around ten therapists throughout my life (due to health insurance changes, etc) and not all of them worked for me. Sometimes I would come out of therapy feeling worse. I really had to keep looking to find one that worked for me and when I did, it helped so much. There are also some online resources such as chatrooms that can be useful. 
I would ask myself whether I felt better or worse when leaving a specific therapist. If I consistently felt worse, I knew it wasn't working.
I quit my career, sold everything I owned and followed my heart for this giant adventure. Reactions varied from „I wish I was as brave as you“, to „that’s crazy, what about money?!“, and behind closed doors, I’m sure people accused me of having my head in the clouds. Loads of people thought I couldn’t do it but those people don’t know how determined I am.  It’s been a frigging hard slog. The last two months almost broke me. But today, I fucking did it.
Congrats! Maybe you can buy a bigger scarf when you graduate!
Gute arbeit!!!!
Thänk you for träveling with deutsche Bahn   Welcome :-)
Looks like a Belgian train, does Germany have those same models? 
Congratulations!  How did you study German? Were you taking intensive courses on a language learning visa? Which level did you have to pass to study? B2?   Sorry lots of questions but I’m currently preparing to do something similar so any tips you can share would be very helpful! 
Danke!
Bless you  
Lol came here for a comment on the ridiculously big scarf, thank you!
Dankeschön 🎉
*Sänk ju for träwelling wis Deutsche Bahn   Kein Ding Brudi
Eagle eyes! I haven’t seen the same ones here in Germany, no. This picture is actually a couple months old - I look like a worn out tea towel today so I didn’t want to upload one from right now. Rest assured, the smile is the same, if not bigger (like the under-eye bags). Haha
Like this person said, the Germans are awesome and you’re going to be fine!  Hmm, advice.. Keep in contact with some of the people back home but don’t be afraid to let go of the ones who fade away. It doesn’t make them shitty people and it doesn’t detract from how awesome you are.  Don’t be afraid to take breaks when you need them and don’t feel bad for doing it. Give it your best shot every day, then you don’t have to apologise for saying „my brain is liquid now and I can’t german anymore today“.  Smile outwardly and roll your eyes inwardly when people tell you „you don’t need classes, you just need to only speak german from now on and never watch/read anything in your native language.“ those people think they’re helping but they don’t know what they’re talking about. It’s the equivalent of saying you don’t need public transport and you should just sprint everywhere as fast as you can forever.  I think that’s the most advice i can give without knowing your situation. If you think you can’t do it anymore, just keep pushing through for another month and then reassess. Rinse and repeat until you’re fluent. You can do it!
I took intensive classes - expensive and hard work but totally worth it. Do your research about the school! I also took a couple breaks to train what I’d learned and read and watch movies in German. I strongly recommend doing that when you need to! (If you’re doing the same method as me). Visa wasn’t a problem for me but I know that they’re quite strict with the language learning visas - classes take attendance and iirc, you need that attendance record to prove you’re complying so make sure you’re showing up!  Any questions you have, feel free to send them my way. I’m no guru but I’m happy to help where I can.  You can do it buddy!!
.... don't people only have 1 second language? you can't have a second second... that's your third. 
You’re absolutely right! Excuse my euphoria-induce brain fart.  Edit: legitimate question though, if I start learning Spanish now, and it gets better than my German, is German my second language because it’s the second one I learned or is Spanish my second language because after my native language, it’s my next best.
there are trains in germany aswell
CONGRATS!
Now stare long and hard at your ring.  While doing this, concentrate on just how happy you are right this moment.  Burn the memory of this happiness into your brain and save it for later.    When you have difficulties later in life, look at your ring and let  that happiness wash over you again before you respond.  The two of you look so happy now, you must remember to work on it and keep it that way.  Believe it or not it does not come naturally.  
Congrats! For the rest of us mortals, the search continues. 
Awww! Genuinely happy smiles. I love it
I'm so happy for you both! What's the story behind the proposal? 
I’m not sure which one you are so I’ll put it two ways:  If you’re the man, congrats on your engagement and you are a seriously good looking dude. I envy your fiancée.  If you’re the woman, congrats on your engagement and your fiancée is seriously a good looking dude. Enjoy waking up to that face every morning.   May your cheeks always be sore from excessive smiling! To many more happy years together!
You two are probably the most beautiful couple I’ve ever seen! May you always be as happy as you are today!
Your happiness has just made my day better, thank you stranger and congrats 
Thank you so much!!
Beautiful advice. Thank you so much. 
Thank you! Hold tight,  the love of your life is looking for you as a type this.  Good luck!
Thank you!!
"It was our two year anniversary. We rented a little cabin in dripping springs, Texas (wine country) to just get away and enjoy each other's company. Apparently he came early while I was at work to decorate the whole cabin with lights and a sign. When we showed up I opened the door, saw the sign and froze. I turned around and he was on one knee with a ring he had gotten made from his grandmother's diamonds. If you can't tell from the photo, I screamed ""YES"" and haven't stopped smiling since. "
Hahaha! That's my dude and couldn't agree more. He's a HUNK!! 
You remind me of Grant gustin in the flash there 
Funny. When I read the post I assumed it was your future husband that posted this! Guess that means I thought HIS cheeks were about to break off. Congratulations! 
Funny! His name is Grant! 
To be fair they both look pretty happy
yeah but his cheeks look more fally-offy
Your capacity for resilience and optimism is admirable! keep it up!
I always thought the cliche “when it rains in pours” can be looked at from the perspective of opportunity. And sometimes that rain entails loss in your life, but rain can also mean a new spring. Away with the dead winter of sordid relationships and depression! A flood can bring to light unrequited joy.
That was a roller coaster of a sentence! Glad it ended on a positive note, and love the optimism! 
I’ve found that keeping my head high means I can overlook a lot of the bad sh*t, or see it in a better light. Thank you. That made me smile:)
Beautifully put. That’s how I’m trying to see it, and I think it’s working!
It’s a little annoying how gorgeous you both are. Congrats! 
I knew I recognized you from [somewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/uglyduckling/comments/6o34ji/what_10_years_of_makeup_self_esteem_and_effort/). How's the twin doing?
Hot young white lesbians kissing AND she's an Ex-Mormon AND She lost weight. We're riding this shit to 100k get in.
Happy 6 months, you both are so beautiful!!
Fellow gay exmormon here! Coincidentally, it was my girlfriend and I’s six month anniversary this last week as well! This is us: [link](https://imgur.com/gallery/ilW6V)   I wish you two the best ❤️
Damn beautiful people and their damn, happy, beautiful lives. What about us sad ugly curmudgeons? Eh? Where's our posts?
They are ridiculous good looking. I never noticed till you pointed it out.
League. 
I feel like you just described most junglers. Or maybe I’ve just had bad luck.
I don't understand how this is relevant or if I'm missing a joke
That's an incredible before and after. 
Is the twin single? 🤔
This is going to postively rival EA's now infamous response regarding Battleground II.
You can only see one's neck though
Yeesh. Better take it to r/karmacourt
Hmmm
OH OH  I'm an ugly bastard, here's a picture of a guy trying to kiss me  [he's a bit of a dog but I think he's happy too](https://i.imgur.com/gzEDHcj.jpg)
Sounds like Dota to be honest.
Bump why the fuck are people talking about League here
With a little hard work and a good attitude anyone can be a happy lesbian in six months. 
Is the twin straight?
No, but I’m still extremely happy for my sister. 
Nice neck tho
that doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about lesbian reproduction to dispute it
Outside. Sunny. Sweet Contigo water bottle. Cute doggos.  Not curmudgeonly or ugly enough. NEXT
 because that's the type of people that look at /r/all on reddit: horny straight males that love lesbians and league
Nice hair, nice ears, nice jaw, petite face, beautiful girlfriend... yeah they’re both hot. 
Sometimes the universe speaks in the best way it can. Thank you for sharing this; and so sorry for your loss.
This is beautiful and brings tears to my eyes.  I am on month 7 and coming up to what would be our 37th Anniversary. You made it and she sent you her love and encouragement. My wife loved cardinals and we used to stop whenever we heard one and search and search for where it perched. At times when my despair is overwhelming I hear one in a distance and that grounds me. Bless you in your travels my friend. It's a lonely walk for sure but you've made it through year one.  I pray I will be as strong as you when mine comes around.
Life has a funny and sometimes beautiful way of reminding us of those that we’ve loved and lost.  This is definitely one of the beautiful ones.  Thank you for sharing.
When my cousins and I brought their mother’s ashes to the ocean, a piece of seaweed with a perfectly printed heart on it washed up to one of their feet as they stood in the surf.
Thank you for those words.
May your life be showered with peace, love, and joy ❤️. God bless you, and show his face to you, my friend.
She wished for her ashes to be spread in the ocean as well 😊. It was lovely. Thank you for sharing this.
You are beautiful. Thanks for sharing your message of perseverance!
I see no scars, you are beautiful and you have a gorgeous smile!
Thank you :)
Thank you! It’s honestly such a double standard that I hold myself to, because I know I am pretty but I still work so hard to maintain outer beauty and it’s so superficial. I know it’s superficial but somehow I still circle back to obsessing over my appearance on the regular. True beauty doesn’t feel superficial. It’s internal.
To be fair, the scars are on the sides of my face and I’m pretty good at covering them
Cool username. Do you play music??
As a creepy non-married straight dude, that pure bright smile is all you need to charm the pants off anybody. Your happiness is really showing through your eyes and that's more attractive than any pretty facial features you have.    We all go through ruts and valleys in life. It sucks, but your smile makes it pretty obvious you're on the upswing! Keep going after your passions and keep kicking ass. I'm battling out of my own little dark spot myself. Pursuing what I love in life is what keeps me going. There's plenty of others fighting with us. Let's keep it rolling! 💪
Exactly. What I see is what the world sees. No scars. You. Are. Beautiful.  Sending Mom hugs your way. 
I do! I’m actually a composer studying at University. I play the oboe!
Good luck, my dude! In a world where everyone fights a personal battle, I’m glad we can at least cheer each other on
"Just want to thank everyone for the encouragement. This isn't exactly something I can post on Facebook but I wanted to share it because I'm proud of it. The changes are subtle but huge in a way. Its little things like having color in my skin, big differences in my eyes, but most of all differences in how I feel and the way I act. I never had clothes money when using. Stopped being able to hold a job despite having a college degree. Moved back home and was kicked out when my 15 year old brother found heroin in the house. Sold everything I could including a beautiful coffee table I made that had a clock under a glass top. Friends, family, and girlfriend all thought I was a sneaky lying piece of shit (I was). Addiction is a disease of pure selfishness. Now I work overtime, have an apartment with the girlfriend, and I wake up happy as fuck every single day. I bought some bitcoin, I bought other people Christmas gifts, and I bought all the groceries for our apartment the other day (usually gf and I split the grocery bill). It sounds like nothing but it's everything to me.  I have started making amends and picking up the pieces. If anyone else is struggling with drugs please message me anytime. I struggled with opiates, Adderall, and Xanax all at once for years. I certainly didn't get clean my first try and I understand how hard it is. I can remember thinking I would never get clean and I frequently wished I would just overdose and die in my sleep. It really does get better if you keep at it. I wake up happy every day now and somehow I just know in my soul that I won't touch opiates again - something I was not able to say any of the other times I ""got clean."" Something clicked. So thanks again.  Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger. I didn't expect this to blow up. I snorted, smoked, and swallowed my opiates for five years. After multiple tries I finally got clean via inpatient rehab and a Suboxone taper. Started as a legal prescription I just couldn't kick.  Bonus pic: my 21st birthday. Cut my hand on a knife I was using to do Molly. Used to think the pic was funny. Now I look at if very differently https://imgur.com/a/VaYs0  Last edit: I'm overwhelmed by the support you all have shown me. I have a ton of people to reply to so if you messaged me I will reply to every single one as soon as I can. To anyone using - get help. Inpatient and Suboxone taper is what did it for me finally. I know you might think you'll never be happy again but once you get past the withdrawal and start getting your life in order you'll be happier than you ever thought possible. My life is not perfect. I lost things I'll never get back. I am still trying to pay off 2500 in CC debt I racked up while using and my student loans. But ya know what, every single time I put a dollar toward my credit card I feel an unbelievable sense of accomplishment. I got a job I love helping developmentally disabled individuals and I have couches and a new bed in my apartment with my beautiful girlfriend. Please don't give up.  "
Dude i cant even imagine how addictive heroin is but i say that to you, the mental strength you must have to surpass the addiction must be tremendous, be proud of yourself!
The fact that the pictures don't show a huge difference is actually quite interesting.  I wouldn't have known you were on heroin in picture 1.  I would have just thought.. skinny guy.  Sometimes people make themselves look like shit in this type of photo to get more attention/sympathy.. or I dunno... but I suspect if your first photo was really messed up then you might have been too far gone to want to change.  Anyhow the fact that the differences are not super apparent is very interesting on all sorts of levels.  Congrats!
My son is 18 and in jail for drug usage. He sold his clothes and his bed. His fucking bed. Breaks my heart every single day. This gives me hope. Thank you for posting. 
Hey amazing! Stay strong. You're a hero.
U had a car while using, as is apparent from the keys in your hand. My car was the only thing I didn't sell when I was using. Idk how I resisted the urge of getting a check for a few grand or whatever it was worth, but I did. You made it this far because you're smart. You didn't sell your car. Good job never sell your car while addicted to heroin cus then how can you travel to go get more heroin. Fuckin heroin is the worst thing in the world. If you're reading this never try it because it will fuck your life up. Even if it doesn't ruin your life it will fuck it up. Worse than anything. You think you can do it but you can't. 
"I'm glad you don't know how addictive it is! If you want an idea just imagine looking at your mother crying, your girlfriend angry and begging you to please stop. Imagine them threatening to cut you out of their lives, bargaining with you, trying to help, doing anything they can. Imagine your cute old grandmother saying ""you're breaking  my heart."" Imagine being ashamed, having pawned your most prized possessions, owing a lot of money to a lot of people. Imagine having the flu times a thousand and wanting to die. Imagine having multiple close calls where you did too much and couldn't breathe. Imagine having a college degree and knowing that literally all you have to do to get rid of your misery is simply not use heroin again. Then imagine getting in your car, driving to the shady part of the city at 2am, going into a run down house and seeing a gun on the table, spending money you borrowed from your 15 year old brother for gas on heroin, and then doing it the second you get back to your car. Then you go home and you lie to your girlfriend who has been your  best friend since fifth grade. You look her straight in the eyes when you're about to nod out and tell her you're clean, feeling great, and that you hope she's proud. You have no idea why you do this. You just know you can't stop.   Heroin showed me parts of myself I wish I never knew existed. Brought me to my knees.    **Edit:** Hey r/bestof! I'm getting a lot of questions so I'll just answer here. Like I said above, I snorted, smoked, and swallowed my opiates for five years. It started with a legitimate prescription for painkillers and I just couldn't stop. It's insidious like that and makes you gradually accept things you never dreamed you'd be doing. Opiates are the devil. What finally ended up helping me stop was inpatient and a slow Suboxone taper. My girlfriend and mother forced me to go because by that point I had totaled my car twice, lost four jobs in six months, failed at quitting through outpatients and NA, took too much multiple times, sold my stuff, did thousands of dollars in damage to my mother's house by leaving the sink on, put a hole through my mother's door, and the list just goes on and on.  Prior to opiates (and early on in my addiction) I was honest and had worked (and never lost a job)  since I was 14. I have a college degree, I was making good money, and I treated people with respect. Then opiates. I was a real piece of shit when using, especially once I made the jump to heroin. My girlfriend stuck around (BARELY) through the lies and horrors only because she has been my best friend since we were really young, and always hoped I could go back to who I was before opiates. It's amazing how, at only 95 days, my thoughts and actions are literally completely opposite of what they were when using. My goal is to have my cup overflow so that I have enough stability and happiness to do for others what so many people did for me. Thanks everyone. Means the world.  **Final Edit:** Hey guys, Reddit's official podcast, Endless Thread, just released an episode about this post and my battle with heroin addiction. You can check it out [here.](http://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/02/16/kickin-it)  Also, I set up an email for anyone who wants help with their addiction or just wants to say hey. You can now reach me at Alex.EndlessRecovery@gmail.com  **Update:** It's October of 2018 and I've been clean for over a year now. I am in graduate school working on my Master's degree. I have made amends with many people I care about including my family and my wonderful girlfriend. I am so happy, and my life is so good. I am still getting emails from addicts and their loved ones looking for help. I'm so glad I have had the opportunity to help some people. If you're stumbling upon this and need somebody to talk to, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm still using the email listed above for this purpose. I want every addict to feel as good as I now feel.  Thanks everyone! "
Yeah I have seen people make themselves look like shit and I didn't want to do that. The differences are indeed subtle. Little things like having color in my skin, huge difference in my eyes I've noticed. There was a period in February where I looked truly sick. My mother said it was the first time she realized I was a full blown drug addict just by the way I looked. Unfortunately/fortunately I don't have any pictures from that time period. My skin was pale looked pulled back over my ribs and face. Eyes were shot from constant all nighters (ya don't sleep much on heroin), etc. But thanks!
Yep. Sounds about right. I sold my PlayStation, a gorgeous table I made:(, and more. I really hope your son finds his way. I really recommend you get him into inpatient as soon as he's out because it'll help more than jail. Inpatient and a slow Suboxone taper is what saved my life. That and a loving family and girlfriend who refused to enable me in any way. My mother and girlfriend ended up giving me a very clear ultimatum: go to rehab and get clean, or you're no longer welcome around us. Period. It saved me
Thank you for the kind words! But the real heroes are the people who helped me get here - even when my use negatively impacted them in many cases. I hope I can do that for somebody someday. 
Actually I totalled my car twice! And when I got a new one I used part of the leftover money to buy heroin. But yeah that's the one thing I didn't sell
Then talk to your doc about it and maybe get back on the subs. Don't let anyone tell you it's not recovery. It's no different than a diabetic taking their meds every morning. If subs allow you to live a productive life and get rid of that ugly addictive behavior then stay on them. Life is too short to be unhappy one way or the other. 
Wow, that's really vivid. The guilt sounds crushing. I'm glad you got clean. I have a close family member who is on heroin, and it breaks my heart and scares me. She's been in treatment many times. I truly hope you flourish and help others along the way. 
"> Imagine having the flu times a thousand and wanting to die.  To just expand on the withdrawal symptoms themselves.  Have you ever been in the hospital and got an IV drip of something like saline?  You know how you can kinda feel it pumping into your veins, it's not quite body temperature so it's a little cold, that kind of thing?  Withdrawal feels like they hooked up an IV full of ice water.  Mixed with glass shards.  And every time you move a muscle, get up to get a drink, go to the bathroom, eat, anything, those glass shards poke at all your insides.  It makes you not want to move.  That's why the stereotypical image of a heroin junkie is one with their arms as close to their torso as they can get, with their hands in their pockets.  You're constantly cold.  I once ran a space heater until my room was 34 degrees celsius, and in between a few seconds of ""oh my god I'm literally on fire"", I always felt cold.  Have you ever had growing pains when you were a teenager?  The weird leg pain that shows up deep in your leg muscles and is the most frustrating, annoying pain of your life, even though it's not actually as bad as, say, getting your leg cut off in an accident?  It's like that, constantly.  All muscles, in constant pain, all the time.  No relief, ever.  Even in your dreams, and I mean this sincerely, it follows you into the dreams.  If you get any sleep at all.  But the tougher of you out there might be thinking ""That's nothing, I can take that.  I've had a really bad flu, I've been through things like this before"".  Except it's not just physical.  It rips you of your mental soul.  There's a television show called ""Over There"", it has an episode called The Prisoner where one of the main characters tries to go off morphine, and it has the most realistic depiction of opiate withdrawal I've ever seen on TV.  In between screaming in agony from the pain, vomiting, and writhing, all he can think of to say to his girlfriend calmly watching over him is ""I'm such a worthless loser, why are you still here, you should let me die"".  A person who was a proud military soldier not a few days before.  A person who didn't even take heroin, but was just given morphine in a hospital setting.  Now imagine that pervasive, overwhelming, irrational chemical feeling in your mind, combined with the knowledge that you actually *are* a piece of shit, you actually *did* do the heroin and all those other horrible things willingly.  Combined with the constant physical agony, where comfort is a mystery crawling out of your own skin.

You’re a fantastic writer. Figure out how to write as part of your future ok? 
As someone with similar demons, I'd say that's how it goes with addiction period. 
Hey man, what you have done is awesome.  And I hate to be the downer, but I feel like it's important.  I have five years clean from all drugs, but I struggled most with heroin.  Just know that you're not out of the woods.  I have seen so many people go back out with six months clean and never come back.  My best friend just relapsed with five years clean.  He's in rehab now, but I honestly don't think it's a fight he's going to win.  No amount of clean time garuntees success unless you put in serious work.  I've seen people with ten years go back out and lose companies and homes and cars and lives.  Just be vigilant man.  The most dangerous thing is thinking you've got it.  Getting clean is the easy part.  Staying clean once you have everything you've ever dreamed of is the true challenge.
I would love that so much. Writing is my passion, that's for sure. Thank you!
Hey, just a stranger passing by but if that's true, I'm hoping you and your wife get some help for it. I've seen too many ruined lives from drug use to pass by this without leaving a comment 
Frogs drink through their skin, so you cooled him off and quenched him.  Way to go frog bro.

Just have to say that anyone who would notice a random tree frog on a hot day, then go get him a drink, is destined to make the world a better place. Keep up the good work.
You give the frog water to drink. Unknown to you, the frog pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the frog arrives.

Ah, retreat!  The giant naked ape is here to eat me!  Strange tactics.  What is that water? A portable pond?    Well, I shouldn't be rude.  I will dip for just a moment.    Ahhh, that's what my green needed.  Thank you kind citizen.
Now he won’t croak!
That is so cute.. And it fits in that tiny cap, wasn't expecting that!
The cold water on his hot skin must have felt absolutely ribbiting.
When life hands you a tiny swimming pool.... 
"Ha that's great, I was expecting him to have a little slurp... Nope ""dis my paddlin' pool""😁 "
What happened after that? Did you set him down in some shade? 
Love this post 🙂 
Funny enough, throughout my life I never realized tree frogs were so small. Never saw one in real life, and the only pictures i occasionally saw were close up.
He literally looks at the person filming before looking at the water and getting in. He steps in as if he may have to jump out, but apparently likes the tasty water, and gets more comfortable. This is some Wind in the Willows type shit.
My parents have a little tree frog that lives in an outdoor umbrella in their backyard in Atlanta. Whenever I’m there I take a spray bottle and spritz it like crazy, little dude must be hot. 
It must have been so grateful. Just imagine crawling around a wall and a floating mini personal pool comes right up to you. 
You are a very good human OP!!
Nothing like heat to make a wild animal love humans. I live in Australia and the summers are quite harsh so once we had a parrot struggling in our back yard so I took him some water in a bowl and he instantly flew onto my head and starting flying down into the water to cool off. After about 15 mins once he cooled down he realised that he didn't need me anymore and the bastard bit my ear and flew off. 
Froggo does a soak
We're lucky humans can't drink through their skin. Imagine public swimming pools..
Thanks for the frog fact. You inspired me and I searched for more.  Fact No. 2 Frogs use their eyeballs to swallow. Frogs eat their prey whole and their eyeballs actually sink down into their mouth and push the food down into their throat.  [source](http://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/all-about-frogs)

I was 16, with a group of other teens out in the boundary waters of Minnesota for a month. It was an ascent program for bad kids. In the middle of this trek, the leaders split us up for 3 days. We had a bag of food consisting of sweet grains and a few pieces of candy, approximately 800 calories. We had unlimited drinking water, 1 bottle and fluoride tabs. We were given a sheet of plastic and 10 feet of twine. We had to setup our own camps and survive alone for 3 days. The first day was frantic, setting a base, making my shelter, ridding insects and clutter to keep away bugs and things that bite. As dusk arises, so does the anxiety. The wildlife is in full roar, to the point that you can't hear your thoughts over the wild birds singing their songs. As the night progressed, and the temperatures dropped, so did the songs of the birds. As it seemed, suddenly the woods were black, pitch black, and nothing could be heard. You could only hear your own heartbeat. I longed for family, comfort. I feel asleep thinking I'd never wake again. SNAP! I'm sitting up, still, holding my breath. SNAP! My eyes are wide, trying to visualize what's near and might possibly be my demise. SNAP! I jump and grab the thing closest to me, a boot. Great. I'm shaking and hysterical. I want to shit. Snap.. the breaking branches are getting softer, its moving away.  It goes quiet. I have a headlamp, batteries so far gone all I get is a dim glow. I decide to turn it on to check the time on my cheap casio. I'm laying down again and I turn my lamp on. FUCKING FROG IN MY FACE! I screamed like girl in a cheap horror movie. The frog stayed in place. Hes sitting out of the weather in my other boot that was tipped over. This frog came back to my boot for the next 2 nights, and slept in my boot right next to my face.  My protector.
You could practically hear an audible “ahhhh”
He's a moist boy
He’s like “idk even know what this is but I need it”
that lil leg shimmy is everything
He hunkers right in. 
"I didn't notice that until the 2nd time I watched the clip but when I did, an audible ""awwww"" followed after."
And now he will repay you years later by sitting outside your house, silently reducing any mosquitos that come around your place.
They definitely did I think!! It’s an important lesson for us all to remember to help take care of any animals that we can as we share this planet with them. That one act of kindness from OP very well may saved that frog, like you said!!
I think he was mostly desperate lol. Frogs don't normally stick around when a human approaches.
"Nah he was like ""If I get in the bottle cap, the human might kill me.  On the other hand, if I don't get in the bottle cap, the heat will kill me.  I might as well take my chances and be comfy before I die."""

I loved how you did that!
This was quite ribbeting to see, really.
It was froggin' awesome
They “drink” through their skin :)
I did. I left him soaking in his pool in the shade. I then refilled a small bird bath nearby and told my mom to keep me posted on future sightings. I hope he hangs around her house. If he does, she will take care of him.

Humans are so incredibly cute! Seeing a random little creature in the wild, surmising that he must be suffering in the heat because the human also doesn't like the heat, deciding to do something to ease his suffering. Filming it to preserve the moment because it makes the human happy to see the creature happy. Posting it online to share the happiness with other humans.  *And all these other humans are extra happy because the creature appeared to be super happy about being in the cap water*  Like, how extra are we??? So ridiculous. So cute

Silently my ass. The tree frogs around me lose their minds for 2 days everytime it rains. Those little bastards are loud when it's sexytime.  Better than cicadas though.  Edit: Of course my highest rated comment ever is about frog sex...
Whilst partially true, I would challenge you on the 'silent' part.  We let our pool go green and now frogs and plants live in it.  It is VERY noisy.
IDK, I had a toad stalking me for about a week a few years ago. Little bastard would sit on my deck and stare into the house, night after night. It would even hop towards me in a rather menacing fashion if I was sitting out there. 
He was just worried because of all those stories about humans putting chemicals in the water to make the frogs gay

How did you get him to not run away when you came near? Just luck, or any special approach? I get lizards in my house all the time and I try to save them but they run away whenever I get close. Takes a lot of patience to finally catch one to help them out.

No, but it's an indicator for future terrible acts just like helping a small animal is an indicator for future kind acts. 
Perhaps if you sought it out just to destroy it, since that, like this, would require keen effort in pursuit of the moral goal.
When the frog goes in, some water spill in a way uncharacteristic for glues. We good.

We have saved their lives, as herons started coming round. At first we thought, how lovely, we are creating a whole ecosystem with native fishies and plants and froggies....  Then we realised he was there to hunt our froggies.  So then we got giant plastic crocodile heads for the pool and he stopped coming.
Don't forget yer water cap glistening full with cooled water
Dream of a Froggy:  “He was dreaming of a water pool as his last wish. Then a nice little pool showed up. He thought at first it was a mirage. But this was fucking real.”  Moral: believe in your dreams 
Yeah, water stinks.
Im a geologist and everyone knows this. What's wrong with you man? Next thing you'll be telling me that pee isnt stored in the balls.
Thank-you. You now have a 2018 subscription to frog facts and will receive hourly updates.   Did you know, frogs eat their own skin? To not waste all the nutritious protein found in their skin. Frogs shed their skin periodically like most animals, but they do not slough it off and leave it behind. Frogs actually push the shedding skin into their mouth and eat it. This is the ultimate way to recycle all the components they used to produce their skin.
Those animals pose a threat to you. Most other animals we kill on a regular basis do not.
I had a vegan roommate who got pissed if anyone killed most bugs, especially spiders.   She went out of her way to kill cockroaches and mosquitoes. She said she made an exception for those because they didn’t deserve to live. I don’t know if she was being morally consistent, but I didn’t disagree with her.
I'd say that's almost self defense.    I'm sure you'd agree that someone who does let mosquitoes, ticks and wasps go could do some real good in the world though.   There's an argument that killing those pests stops other life from being killed or hurt, but that's a dangerous line to walk.

Oof. I moved from a cool climate to a very, very warm one. As soon as I hear the first cicada of the season, I know I'm in for a miserable six-to-nine-months.  It should never be 100 degrees in either March or October, god damn it!

Those are the worst bugs.   Spiders kill other bugs.   Enemy of my enemy idea, I think it passes. 
I've never been vegan but I went through a phase where I started thinking that spiders have a role to play, such as killing random bugs, so I'd let them live. Ants, as long as there weren't too many, were sort of a clean up crew for crumbs, so I let them live.  But cockroaches? Flat out serve no purpose. Mosquitos? Worse than serving no purpose they serve a negative purpose.

I’m glad you’re not one of the idiots that drive with their dog in their lap while texting and eating their burrito.
I mean, that's probably the best spot. 
Honestly super smart. He's probably super comfy and doesn't get jostled around like most dogs do in cars
Someone needs to ride in the back seat and give scritches. I volunteer as tribute. 
Super cute and all but I would be terrified of being rear ended.   I also live in so cal so maybe that's indicative of the shitty drivers I deal with on a daily basis. 
I was very mad this morning, got into it with my fiancée and now the doggo made me happy and I’m going to send this to her to make her happy and remember that I love her despite our quarrels and qualms. 
That sort of behaviour is exactly why I want a malamute, they're just such fun dogs
Cute, but super dangerous. :( If rear ended, trunk crumples. If hit from any other angle while his head is sticking through that hole, or if the car rolls over, could result in serious injury or worse. Best bet is to train and use [doggy seatbelts](https://www.budgetdirect.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/How-to-keep-your-dog-safe-in-the-car.png)!

It's dangerous to drive distracted. You might accidentally eat your dog and text your burrito.
Unless they get rear ended. The trunk of a car is a crumple zone. It’s designed to fold up like an accordion :(  Edit: some these replies are gold. 
On the other hand if they get rear ended he's on trouble as the trunk is a crumple zone. 
And look how clean those back seats are.

Or.. hear me out... Buy MORE pitchforks. Just in case.
You let a dog free range in a car and it will find the weirdest place to hide.  My guess is the owner used to let him sit at the back seats when he was still a pup, and one time he forgot to close the opening to the trunk and the pup figured out he could go to the back of the trunk and use hide there because dogs loves to hide in dark places.
If you're in an accident strong enough to crumple any zone, it's prety likely that your (assumed) unbelted dog anywhere in the vehicle is going to have a really bad incident, and may even take you down with it, since it becomes a 60lbs projectile inside the main cabin heading towards the front seats. 
r/foundthemobileuser
Apparently it's waaaaaay easier if you do it while driving. I see it all the time. If that does not work, try adding one more task, like putting on makeup.
Dogs don't typically wear seatbelts, so if we're going to think of bad scenarios, every unsecured place in the car is high risk. The trunk would likely be safer in a head-on.   Every time you get into a car, you take a risk, this is just heightened for most pets.  Edit: I'm surprised how many people responsibly get harnesses to buckle their dogs in. That's good. I've personally never seen it, but I'm also from an area where people have dogs standing in the back of a flat bed truck going 60.
Yeah, it’s a car they aren’t 100% safe.
Not really safe anywhere in the car without a seat belt, more an issue with dogs in cars in general than specifically dogs in the trunk of cars.
This. I was rearended with my dog in the back seat at 60 mph. Even in the seat he was almost crushed up against the back of the front seats and I really don't care to think about what it would have been like if he were in the trunk. 
On the other hand if they get hit on the side or front, the doggo isn't a projectile, which would cause more harm to the dog and the human driver.   Best place is in the back seat with a secure harness, this is probably second best position for the dog if you're not willing to put the dog in a harness.
I can do drinks as long as there are snacks for both human and canine passengers.
You too, I guess

Head behind the brake pedal is where mine ends up so she is banished to the back seat.
No. If you aren’t moving and get hit from behind. The trunk is designed to absorb the force of the impact and protect the people in the cabin. Otherwise, you might be right
Include me in the screenshot with a sloth covering my username. 
Yeah and it's kinda funner if you close your eyes occasionally,  it also is supposed to give you more rest and energy! Cool fact right?
">	Dogs don't typically wear seatbelts  Which is a shame as a proper harness for the car is really not that expensive and legally required in many countries"
They make harnesses for dogs to combat this exact issue. There's a vet comment somewhere in this thread detailing a dog surviving a crash specifically because of the seatbelt harness. It's just information that needs to be spread more. 
I question your taters
6 yr account... 33k karma... Well done.
I wanna be in the screenshot!
My cat likes to sit underneath my legs while driving, which is definitely not safe, so he's not allowed out of his crate while traveling anymore.
Yes and his point was a dog not wearing a seatbelt wouldn’t stay in its place like a human does..because they’re wearing seatbelts.

Veterinarian here. I recently saw a dog who was properly secured with a car harness in a car that got rear ended on the highway by a distracted driver when stopped for traffic. The car was totaled and the dog's owner was fortunately wearing her seat belt as well, and the owner had to be stretchered out but fortunately only suffered a moderate concussion and whiplash injuries. I was able to treat the dog as an outpatient for whiplash and some bruising/soft tissue swelling in the armpits from the harness, and the dog and the owner both made full recovery. That dog 100% would've been dead from that crash if it wasn't secured and he ended up as a projectile through the windshield. Everyone should wear their seat belt and secure their pets too.
Best to get him his own car, secured to the back of your car. 
What?
I like how this is back and forth with valid arguments lol
Dude, you have to put the dogs condition/whether they lived or died a lot sooner! That was a rollercoaster and I was holding my breath for most of it. 
Tell me where to find crash tested harnesses for large dogs. All I find are for little toys or haven't been verified as actually safe. My boy cracked a tooth in the accident that totalled my car. I had whiplash and a concussion. I'm pretty sure he did too.   Emergency vet didn't detect any breaks at the time but did prescribe doggie pain med and low activity rest. Cracked rear molar was found months later during dental cleaning and normal vet said impact probably caused it.  For details, my dog was in the back seat of my then-sedan. He was collared and leashed (and microchipped, and insured) but not attached to the car itself. My windows were cracked but I never put them all the way down, thus his head was not out the window at the time of impact because he never puts his head out the window. If my windows had been down all the way he probably would have jumped out of the car (and thus into traffic) from his fear after the impact.   Edit: Thanks for recommendations!
Maybe they won’t save a dog’s life in a severe crash. But it’s not going to be worse than turning an unrestrained dog into a projectile; which will almost certainly kill it, and possibly any other passenger who may happen to be in the way.
#I question your taters
No kidding, I was like... should I keep reading, uhg, will he live?!  PHEW!

Stolen dog [reunited after 2 years.](http://i.imgur.com/EvlwRe8.gifv)
TF did the thieves think was gonna happen once they had to bring the dog in?  Edit: Apparently they didn't steal it; they bought it in front of a mall. In any case, they shouldn't have tried to keep it once they found out it had a proper owner.
my girlfriend found a dog awhile back and tried to find an owner but no one called back to the signs. she didn't check for a chip because he was pretty haggard looking and she didn't have time to take him to the vet. fast forward to a few months later and she takes him into the vet for a check up and just as a joke checks for a chip and what do you know, he has one. perks up to his old name and she took him to his owner that night, her family was ecstatic and thought he was long gone. i miss that little dog but i am glad he's back with his original family. 
They should have had a neutral person bring the dog in, and have each person just stand there and then see.   Edit: Oh wow this was after 2 years. Definitely his dog  Edit2: Just saw the video of the case and it was actually just 5 months. By the time they got on the show it was 6 or 7 months total
My mom's boss was going through some personal problems and had to get rid of his dog. My mom said she would baby sit till he got everything in order. Mom had a car accident not long after and could not work anymore. Her boss moved to another state to take care of one of his kids. 5 years goes by and he comes into town for court with his ex wife. His dog went ape shit when she heard his voice. Dog was crying tears, barking like crazy, and running in circles around him.     We ended up baby sitting the dog for 12 years. She died at 18, but any time he came over, you could tell she was always his dog.

The dog was stolen, but not by the woman on the right (defendant).   She bought it from a woman off the street for her mom and had grown attached to him.   I'm sure she knew it was his dog, but it was hard for her to part with him.

When I was in college my girlfriends roommate went to a party where she got into it with the person who was throwing a party, she ended up stealing his new kitten and then drove to the humane shelter and said it was hers and she couldn't take care of it anymore. It made my blood boil beyond belief but she was proud of it. I hope that kitten found another good home
A friend of a friend just had their service dog stolen while a party was being held at their house. Pretty messed up.
I knew some girl that was on a dog beach, she said the dog vanished just like that. She had two of them there and one got stolen.
I would love to see the source video for that.  Also, what the hell happened to that dog in those two years that it was that terrified and cowed?
If I recall the defendant in this case didn't steal the dog, but (unknowingly) bought the dog from the thief.

I returned a stolen dog to its owners once. (I didn't steal him, I found him after he escaped from the people who stole him) and he was was very sweet and affectionate to me, but when he saw his parents he went nuts. They know. 
ebaumsworld..? what is this, 1999? I had no idea it still existed
"To be fair the dog did start jumping to her right afterwards, so he might ""do that to everybody"". Clearly the guys dog though "
"not shown in the gif...  Judge: ""put the dog down, put the dog down.""  Mom: *quietly* ""Don't!!! Don't!!! Don't!!!"".  Girl:  Puts the dog down.  Dog: ""Daddy?!?!?! Daddy?!?!?! DAAAAADDDYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!"""
Still pretty pissed Trump didn't put her on the Supreme Court. 
I thought it was even more telling that the owner started crying in public.  No one does that for a dog that's not theirs.
"""Yeah that's weird, he usually multiplies to the equal number of people in the room and his clones greet each person."" "
I imagine he was reading a newspaper, he put it down temporarily, his glasses slid down the slope of his nose a bit so he could look you straight in the eye without a piece of glass in the way. He delivered the line, pushed his glasses back up, and then leaned back and continued reading the paper. 
Oh wow. What a little slut. He's very cute
Yeah but if your dog hasn't seen you in say a week, and you are in a room with strangers there is only 1 person he is going to run to.
"Except this dog ran past the woman who claimed she ""bought"" the dog from someone to this guy.. Not even the woman he was with, just the guy. As Judge Judy said, ""It's his dog"""
I think what sells this case in particular is the fact that the dog is calm during the entire walk down the aisle, but then you can see the exact moment when he catches his owner's scent and goes nuts once there's voice confirmation.  I've had dogs that show this type of interest in strangers too but when there are multiple people around they'd usually bounce around sniffing everyone first.
I have a Siberian Husky too.  Every single time she meets someone,  it's like those videos of soldiers surprising their dogs after being away for years.   She's like that with the cable guy, dishwasher repairman, everyone. 
Send me this sub if it exists. Omg so good.

"If it makes you feel better, she has all the reason to be respected as a television personality. She was an actual family court judge in New York, and then switched to the television show, which is actually a binding arbitration. So it is an actual alternative to going to court, but is still considered a legal agreement to whatever the outcome is. About as ""real"" as reality TV can get."
But god help you if your case involves computers. I've seen her screw up a few times just because she didn't give a shit about the technical details of how something worked.
I think a lot of it is that, with most reality TV, you watch because you just like the characters for no meaningful reason. They have good fashion taste or are pretty or whatever. Or the subject is about buying houses or something.  Judge Judy is a level-headed, clear-thinking, intelligent woman with great patience and firm integrity. (I don't know about her personal life, BTW, just taking this from what I've seen of the show). The revolving doors of good and bad people exists to highlight how she is a good judge of character and morality.  I honestly think it's just significantly better than most reality TV shows because you watch to admire a genuinely admirable person. 
That's a very succinct and accurate way to put it
in this case, it's someone who wants the attributes of a loyal dog without all that having to be nice or a good person.
oh, that's actually really sad. but honestly she knew better.
To the top!  But yes, that's really sad. Still sort of enraging that she can't see that despite her mom growing attached to the dog, it wasn't rightfully hers as it was stolen from it's original owner, who the dog obviously still loved and missed.
Who buys a dog from a woman off the street??
"someone tried to steal my cat but my cat is loud as fuck when she wants to be. She wouldn't stop meowing and I eventually found her a few houses down.

I watched a little girl in my neighborhood steal my dog right out of my backyard. I got her to give her back, her parents eventually bought her a dog that looks exactly like my dog with the same name, it was creepy but I forgave her because she was a kid.

"I'm so glad that stopped for the most part. Those posts used to happen all the time.    ""Saw this dog alone in a fenced yard, gave him a better home"". No, you stole a dog."
I'm not joking when I tell you I would have made the rest of her college career a living hell. I'd tell EVERYONE what a horrible thing she had done. 
A friend of mines ex just had her dog put down. He refused to let her take the dog, she would go visit the dog and they constantly fought over him. The ex just didn't want her to have the dog. When she went out of town on vacation, he took the dog to the pound and paid to have it put down. She found out the day she got back. Understandably she was a total wreck and everyone who knew her wanted to kick the ex in the nuts. 
You don't steal an abused dog. You report it to the authorities. Otherwise your situation will happen.
"Maybe the dog is thinking, ""Is it really you?"" Then finally got the smell of old bro and the question confirmed. "
I grew up with a little red nosed pit bull my step mother rescued. I walked this dog everyday, two or three times a day. Sometimes at 2 or 3 in the morning. We were always together if I was home. When I came back from my first deployment and got to go on leave my old man picked me up and we went straight back to our house. I got out of the car and she was playing in the front yard, so she ran up to greet what she had thought was a stranger. I'd lost a lot of weight, and I must have smelled completely different. It took her a few seconds to realize who it was, but when she did her legs buckled, she dropped to her belly, started whimpering, and then she wet herself. I know they say dogs don't have emotions the way humans do, but it's very hard for me to describe the look this girl had without saying she was totally overwhelmed by seeing her friend, and I really felt the same way. Of everyone I could have missed while I was gone, I missed her the most. She'd never hurt me, and she always made me feel like I was the best dude in the world when I was sad. The first thing we did when she got her shit together was go for a really good long walk together. I miss that little dog so much. It still gets to me that she's gone and it's been years.

"I left my dog with a friend for two days last week because I had to go out of town, and this is *exactly* how he reacted to me. Like ""Holy shit? You're back?! Is it really you!? OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU MY FAVORITE PERSON IS BACK OH MY GOD I'M SO FUKCING HAPPY RIGHT NOW.""  I've had him since he was 8 weeks old, and with the exception of nights where I might put him in his covered pen around 10pm and then wake up at 9am, we've never been apart for longer than 8 hours in the five months I've had him. So he was probably pretty stressed out about me being gone for 48 hours.  Edit: To clarify, I'm not saying the excited reaction doesn't happen literally every time I come back into his line of sight, I'm saying the look of fear/disbelief happened this one time after I was gone for 48 hours."
I think he just didn't really know it was him until he got a smell of him. [reminds me of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3NxqaT9e_I)
That's actually kind of sad for her then; if she didn't do anything wrong, but still lost the dog she probably had grown attached to.
"""That's what happens when you buy a dog in front of the mall for fifty bucks"""
"Yeah, I gave her a lot of shit for it because I always said you never know but she just never got around to it. Kind of a lesson learned I guess. We just said it was his year ""studying abroad"" lol."
Yeah, I wasn't there for the exchange but I guess her kids ran out screaming his name and my girlfriend almost cried. Her two dogs were sad that the third went home for good so when someone offered a chihuahua puppy (the lost/found dog was a chihuahua) she jumped at the chance to take him in and now our new puppy helps fill the void lol. Her dogs took him in instantly and they all love each other now. They're my best friends lol.

"Yeah, my wife used to be a dog walker for almost 2 years.   A little while ago, she had a day off her new job and took our dog to the park to meet up with some of her regular dogs that she used to see every day, and one of them did basically this.  ""Is is you? I don't know if it's you. I'm not going to get excited yet unless I know for sure it's you. OMG IT'S YOU!!!"""
Aaaaaand I'm crying now.
Anyone who doesn't think dogs have emotions has never been a dog's best friend. Once you have been, you will never doubt it again.

A buddy of mine is a retired Navy helicopter crew chief.  He told me a story about coming home late one night from a training mission and entering his house quietly so as not to wake his wife.  According to him, after a long flight on the helo, you usually smell like aviation fuel and engine oil.  His 100+ lb. Yellow Lab didn't recognize him because of the smell, and got between him and the door to the bedroom where his wife was sleeping.  The dog snarled at him with hackles raised until he spoke to him and the dog recognized him.  The dog was scared enough to pee on the floor while he was growling, but he was going to protect his mama.
She might have gotten attached to the the dog, but the dog certainly wasn't attached to her.
Yeah I was gonna watch Air Bud tonight... Now that it's ruined what dog related movie should I watch instead?

It's absolutely baffling that people don't know this and think it's a real courtroom show.
I don't know. After the crash in 2008 I was layed off, in debt, and hungry.    I stole a lawnmower. I went knocking on door of houses with long grass and mowed their lawns for grocery money. It got me through.    For the record, I made it right a few years ago. I left a Christmas card in their mailbox with money (cost of new mower) and a note explaining what happened with my name and number. They called to thank me, forgive me, and tell me they donated the money to the food bank. The old guy was great about it, was joking that it was a great thing I did stealing his mower. He bought a riding mower to replace it and his back doesn't hurt anymore. 
What if I steal your heart? :)
"Oh not at all. It can get a great deal more complex than that. Stealing a dog can never be motivated by desperation like many other things in the category of ""anything"".   Something about Sith and absolutes..."
well no, stealing a living creature is much worse
Whenever I see ;( I can't help but think of an old sea dog who's sad. Just needs a pipe.
Just ask for visitation rights on weekends
My friend who worked at Chipotle once told me about these three teen boys showed up with not one but two German Shepherd puppies. They were purebred, around 6 months old or so. The boys were trying to sell them for 200 bucks a piece, even had their AKC papers. In the few hours they were there they sold one, but left before selling the other.  Cops showed up the next day with this middle aged couple to check camera footage for the license plate of the car that bought the one puppy. Apparently one of the boys stole the dogs from his family because he wanted to buy a car, and told his parents the puppy had ran away. My friend said it was heartbreaking because the mom was in tears and the dad was upset too. She's not sure if they ever found who bought the dog. But how do you do that? Sell a family member to satisfy your greed? A family member that is clearly loved and cherished? Rotten pricks. 
There are people who sell stolen pets, believe it or not. When I worked at Walmart we had to kick some folks out of our parking lot for trying to sell pit bull puppies that it turned out they had stolen.
Glad that worked. One of the primary reasons to get your dog microchipped is it's almost impossible to _prove_ a dog is yours. Like, sure it looks like your dog and acts like it... but what a coincidence! 
I think that happened to my neighbor's cat.  She was awesome and super friendly.  Never saw a cat before that would come running when you called it, especially without food in your hand.    She disappeared one day, we never saw her again, the neighbors were pretty distraught.  Messed up as it is that someone would steal a cat, I prefer that idea to the alternative.  Our houses back up to a pretty busy road...
yeah but she's adopted, I dunno, she's not my child, I couldn't just go to them and present my concerns about their parenting.. this was 14 years ago, she must be in her 20's now. 
"Rescue usually means they got it from the pound, not found it in the street.  And while it's a little laughable when people call getting a free dog ""rescuing it"" it's better than them stealing someone's dog."
Yeah I don't know if I believe this story just bc of that. You'd think it would be simple for someone, anyone, who knew the person tell them what happened to their kitten and they could go readopt it or just pick it up.
That *does* actually happen sometimes...
Unfortunately this is not as uncommon as we would hope. I've seen a bunch of stories on here about it but also have experience with it in a similar manner.   My ex had a dog walking business and I got to meet these two beautiful  pits named Georgia and Zeus. Spoiled, huge things that she brought my 1 yr old son around and there were never any issues.   One night she gets a phone call from the owners. They had Georgia put down because she chewed some furniture. My ex was in tears, I was appalled. I asked how the fuck someone could just have an animal executed like that, and my ex taught me about how vets won't question an owners request because our beloved pets are considered property before they're considered a living being. 
*holy fucking ball licks*
Dude should utilize more of his keyboard 
That's got to be so scary for the dog! Like a stranger wearing your family member's skin as a suit.
That is hard to say. My dogs were always far more interested in a loved one they hadn't seen recently than the one they've hung out with recently.   Maybe we'd see the exact opposite reaction after the dog spends a week in the home of the other guy.
Sandlot
Completely from memory from that ama.  They buy small claims court disputes (less than $1500 I believe).  So this saves time and money in the justice courts and their rulings can be whatever they want.  The plaintiffs have to both agree but they will because it is a win win situation even if they know they are guilty or will lose.  They pay out $1500 so the each side gets $750 but then your win/loss from Judge Judy's verdict will swing it to the other person.  So even if you would lose the case completely, you only lose the $750 they pay you while the other party walks off with $750+$750.  In the case where you lose and need to pay lets say $300 in damages, one party gets $750+$300 = $1050 while the losing party gets $750-$300 = $450.  This is why they are able to get so many cases, even the weird ones because even the guilty/losing party knows by agreeing to be on tv, they make some money or get out of paying anything at all. 
Is this a Trump quote?
"Mix the two together and you get Randy Marsh.    *""I am not 'chugging a beer'.  I'm having 6. It's called a Smorgesvein, and it's elegantly cultural!""*  "
What's wrong? Are you ok? 
I mean yeah it's not preferable but it can get the job done.
However, *it is* legally binding arbitration. They sign a paper saying her judgment is final, and it would hold up in the court of law. However, if she awards one party $5000 in damages the show pays it rather than the defendant like in normal arbitrations. 
I love this and I will admit to doing something similar and paying it back. Good on you !!! 
Then its yours to keep :-)

"One of my dogs had two pups before we got her spayed. The same person bought both pups, someone my mom kind of knew. I think a few months later we visited them. I wasn't crazy attached to them, but it was just nice to see them and that they were happy. And I have a few of acquaintances and  friends that I'm ""Aunt Poi"" to their pets. If she just made friendly with the owner, she may have been able to be a friend to him and see the dog or even dog sit it when he was out of town. It's better than never seeing them again. "
I would be mortified that I raised such a terrible human being.   
Where was that dumbass gonna get a car for 400 bucks, anyway?
There's a special place in hell for people that steal other peoples puppies. 
Or steal a pet, wait for a reward to be offered, then return it for the money.  As in the movie Seven Psychopaths, that doesn't always go well.
As an aside, my cat was a TNR stray dumped in my neighborhood when she was just ~6months old. My neighbor was feeding her but couldn't afford to actually keep her, and this silly cat kept fucking curling around my ankles and tripping me and my boyfriend up every time we would come home and get out of our cars, and then she'd sit outside our front door whining while we cooked and had dinner. A few weeks later, we caved and took her in, fell in love, then took her to the vet. She had a microchip. Uh-oh. Damn. Maybe this is actually someone's missing cat? But her ear was tipped? wtf?   So anyways, yeah, we took her into the vet, they scanned her, and there was no name in her info, just the address of a vet in the county who works with the pound and does free tnr services once a month. They called to confirm that this was true, and we also checked with the microchip company that there really was no mistake, that this really was for absolute sure not someone's pet and that was actually their real vet they had taken her to and they just hadn't updated their personal microchip info.  They scanned her number, and yeah no. The vet confirmed. The microchip company confirmed. She came in with a batch of kittens caught from feral strays. I called the microchip company again right away and asked them how to update that shit, and SHE HAS BEEN ALL MINE EVER SINCE! It will be 4 years on November 11th.  **CHIPPING IS SO IMPORTANT**   [Cat tax](http://imgur.com/a/ruqIR) 
Time to look her up and steal her dog. Payback's a bitch.
Adopted child? Maybe she was stolen, too.
"No, these posts really happened. About 5 years ago, this sub used to be filled with these ""rescue"" posts. People were just taking pets. "
"Well at least they aren't buying it. In the bird and aquarium keeping subreddits people post all the time how they ""rescued"" this animal they bought from a pet store because the enclosure was too small or the food was inadequate. Like bro you didn't rescue anyone, if anything you just funded the pet store to keep treating animals that way."
Same thing here. I live in an area with a lot of strays and lots pets that are uncared for. Every once in awhile if they go in the street ill pick them up and return them if they have tags or take them to the shelter to get scanned for a chip. It that comes up with nothing I put posters everywhere.  The dog I adopted had no collar and no chip and lots of fleas. I took him home put up posters and got him scanned. The neighbors of the owner eventually called me as they would pick him up often when he would get out. I got in touch with the original owner and bought a collar for him. He would keep getting out and coming to my place though. Eventually he came by with his tags taken off. He just kicked the little fucker out and didnt even tell me or the neighbor. He was probably the biggest asshole Ive met and he abandoned a fantastic dog.  Ive picked up another dog whose owners I cant find. He probably belonged to someone but he was thin as hell and had a broken foot. I feel guilty his owners didnt see my posters or go to the shelter to ask about him but hes got a good home now.  Sometimes depending on where you live it can be hard to tell a dogs situation. As long as you do your best to find the owner I see no foul in it
"That's my thought as well.   Our dog had a foster mom for a week and despite owning him for over a year, when he sees her he's all over her (which isn't often).  He'll eventually get his fill of her, and once he does, he's glued to me again. If this was all Judge Judy was basing ownership on, I'd for sure lose the ""trial"".  EDIT: Not to say that the ruling is wrong. If it's his dog then he should get the dog back. It just sucks that the other woman has to lose her pet in the process."
Annie are you okay?
Hunger makes people do things they wouldn't normally do. I knew it was wrong, but I was desperate, I had to do something. I felt terrible about it until the moment I closed the mailbox. It was not a new machine either. I would have returned it but the cylinder eventually cracked and it went to the scrap heap.
GET A ROOM!
The only time it's okay to steal a puppy, in my mind, is when you know for sure it's being abused or is going to be used for dog fighting or something.
Are we sure it was a female dog though?
The problem here is your mom.
Thanks for your story.  It's important for people to see honesty modeled.  
No. I like to watch.
That's called dog rescue, which is a service done by professionals every day.  If you think an animal is being abused, call them. Don't do it youself.
Are we sure Payback was her name?

And THIS is why I love boxers!! This doggo is the embodiment of the breed; they are the spazziest, lovable and loyal dog you will ever have! I have had 2 in my life. I lost my girl Izzy last year - she was my bff for 12 great years!! I miss her dearly. But I don't have the heart to have another - I will see her in heaven because that is where she is. :)
I used to compete in Schutzhund nationally and help train people to train their dogs.  Whoever taught her how to train her dog did an excellent job. None of it is forced, the dog is willingly complying.   I'm not sure if this is a mock trial, some other obedience event, or an official Schutzhund B event, but further stages are age-restricted as the dogs mature. This would not be allowed in later trials but it shows that the dog has an eagerness to please and obey and that she is keeping training fun.
And after running up to her.  I don't see any problems here.
I did exactly what you asked. You didn't say walk like a normal dog.
and pulled some massive style points doing it!
He just put his own spin on it.
That is his fancy whirligig sit. Give him a treat right now.
It doesn’t matter how you get there, it just matters that you get there.
It's subtle, but I think it will set us apart juuuust enough from the competition.

My neighbors boxer put his paws through the glass of the windows next to the door on 3 separate occasions. He was so excited to see them coming home he just broke the window to try and get to them. They put a bookcase in front of the window after that.
As soon as I saw it was a boxer doing the command, I knew it would derp out at some point.
Boxers might just be the very best dogs.

It didn’t look like anyone laughed! How is that possible?!
This was AKC Novice Obedience. The dog did Q with 181 points. Lost 3 points for the spinning ;)
This is an Obedience trial, the dog is in Novice (just starting to compete). Here's a full video of a [AKC Novice Obedience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBd0PiqiaW0) run.
I used to do obedience with my GSD.  You can never train the exuberance out of a dog... All you can do is train them that there are certain times when they can't act like a little weirdo.  They will still be goofballs the other 99% of the time lol.
Looks like perfect execution to me.
10 on technical merit and 10 for artistic impression.
Its a boxer, that's normal for them
I had to watch it a few times, but I think I finally caught it--was the extra step that Tasmanian cyclone of demon possession?
Pretty sure I saw a cartwheel in there somewhere...
Save the money and buy yourself something nice.  I really appreciate the thought though :)
I love that. Schnoodle, you are the best.
This is really good, fair play. Ye had me at the dog emoticon :@)
"Not OP but there was a party joke where you ask people to see if they notice anything weird about your gait, then walk seven or eight steps and turn to them.  They will say they didn't notice anything (or even better, start pointing things out) but you say no to all guesses and try again, this time walking more slowly.  Again, nothing, or guesses, you get the idea. You can do another or a couple more slower walks, then go to punch line.  Finally when it's punch line time, you walk verrrrry slowly, but after two steps you stop and flip out, flailing your arms and jumping around like a crazy person, then recover quickly and finish slowly walking the remaining steps.  They you turn to them and say ""did you notice it that time?""  It's a good theatrical joke."

"My father had a boxer, one night we were watching a WW2 documentary and the soldiers were reflecting on the window into the backyard. Dog started growling at them, and my dad egged him on and said ""Go get them!"". Old boy ran straight into the glass head-first and shattered it.  Dog was perfectly fine, but my father learned that maybe he should replace low windows with plexiglass from then on."
He didn't get hurt, did he?

So true. I had a boxer once. Only dog I've seen that can retain eye contact while running in the opposite direction.
I love boxers! Probably would never own one but I love them.
No no, you gotta watch it a few times more, it was actually the human who messed up. She didn't fold the leash perfectly in half. Noob
No if you looks really closely in the middle of the second step he lifts his paw .00005 seconds early and plants a third step with the same paw .0003 seconds later. Truly spectacular.

If anything like our boxer, likely small skin deep cuts. We had french doors and I think he put every pane out and we just replaced them with plexiglass.

Good dog didn't actually want to bite either, it was just pretending. 
Oh my gosh this video. That sweet dog not wanting to bite, and then the dude reaching out to comfort his doggie, just so much sweetness in such a short clip.     *Edit:Holy cow my first gold! Thank you kind stranger! Happy New Year everyone!!
I'd like to think my dogs would act like this but I have Huskies, and they would just as likely bugger off for an adventure.
My dog would be like “Loads of new people here **and** my owner is on a stretcher and can’t stop me meeting them?? Best day *ever*!
The guy reaching out to comfort his doggo at the end got me.
"""I am going with him. Or else."""
:( what a good pup. Hope the owner was ok
Good doggo? No.  The best doggo. 
When my partner fell down stairs and broke her leg, our dog came to sit on her and protect her.  ... I mean, it wasn't exactly helpful, but it was rather sweet.
I should get a dog
i am the dog n this my man -  i doing every thing i can  to keep him safe - i will PROTEC!  you hurt my friend - i'll give you Heck  there's something wrong, he can't get up  is Now he needs his hero pup!  i'll put my whole life on the line  until i know that he is fine  no other bond is greater than  the one between a dog and man
The fact that man is risking pain to comfort his dog shows there bond is strong. 
anyone know the story behind it? Where was this, what had happened to the owner etc?
Loyalty 
This hits home on a personal level. I have the bestest baby girl that I adopted a few years ago. Several months ago my landlord came over to fix something. I passed out when I opened the door for him, then passed out again when I got up to get water, prompting him to call an ambulance. The entire time I was on the floor waiting for paramedics, then waiting as they took my vitals and got more information, she was at my side with her front paws on top of me and wouldn’t move. The paramedics were awesome and just worked around her. She came to the emergency room with me on the stretcher. I ended up in the hospital for three days and couldn’t get out of bed on my own because I was a fall risk. She stayed in that hospital bed with me the whole time I was there except for when I asked the nurses to take her outside to relieve herself. Shoutout to all of you in the medical/emergency services profession who are so understanding of the bond between dog and owner in situations like this.   Edit: here’s a pic from the emergency room for anyone interested https://imgur.com/gallery/PbozdXO 
...as a former street medic, I can assure you I would be talking to the doggo like, you're a good boy and you can come with us, but we gotta help him, too...yes, you're a good boy, yes you are...  I don't know how we'd transport him and keep track of him at the hospital, maybe bring a neighbor along for kicks or something. But, hey, the dog goes in my book. 
As an EMT I have a hard time not petting people's dogs even though I know I am the most likely person they'll bite.   I've met some really awesome dogs at work though so it's worth it. As long as I have enough fingers left to put on ekg leads/drive for my medic. 
I feel like this dog will gladly take a bullet for him
Wow someone's really got nerve, cutting onions in my own house
Dogs rock
"Yeah that was just a ""Dude I'm telling you I'll DO IT IF I HAVE TO!!!!!"""
He threw himself in between his human and the baddies!!! 
What sticks out to me, is the dog wasn't aggressive towards those around its owner giving medical assistance. It Just wanted to be with its owner. 
He wanted to be sure the owner would honor their arrangement, a dentastix at a quarter past 3. 
I liked the fact that the original guy holding the dog didn’t overreact to the biting. When he is by the owner, the original guy is petting the dog again. 
His tail between his legs 😢 he’s so scared. 
Also have a husky, she would 100% use this as an opportunity to run off.   She would also come back 2 hours later and wonder why I wasn't letting her back in the house (she's not the brightest of crayons). 
My dog sucks as a guard dog and doesn’t really learn tricks. But she would for sure be the dog in the video. She sticks to me like glue- I trip over her daily. Even something like me leaving her with some friends to go get a beer at the dog park or something- my friends say she just stares after where I went and then acts like I’ve been gone weeks when I get back. This dog threw her back out greeting me after I was gone for a work trip and couldn’t walk for several days, she still dragged herself off her bed to try and follow me around.   She’s a little simple and silly, but she loves more deeply than I know how to understand. I’m very glad I have her in my life. 
Depends on the day my Akita is having. She will either go full bear or fuck off into the woods.
Malamutes would just show strangers where the valuables are. They can pull heavy loads but are worthless otherwise. 
Ditto. Plus he would be taking full advantage of the restraints on me to give me a full face wash and oral cavity search.  Edit: My top comment is about my dog and his obsession with giving kisses. Figures! He's a friendly little Jack Russell
I sliced off a sliver of my thumb a few months ago onto the floor.    I worry about being on a stretcher now my dog knows I'm edible.    
"You dropped this ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ """
Broke my damn heart. I haven't seen a dog so scared and uncertain since that one [screaming shelter dog,](https://youtu.be/h5XzGyjEkkc) and that makes me really sad. :( I'm glad his owner is such a major point of security for him, though...  Edit: forgot link lol  Edit 2: THANK YOU FOR MY FIRST EVER GOLD KIND STRANGER!!!
I’m in tears. I thought this would be funny but I actually said OH SWEETIE NO when he came on the screen.
The dude couldn't even see what was happening but knew it was his pup. Beautiful. I hope he made it out ok for his pups sake. 
I felt sad he couldn't come with his hooman, but also happy after his person gave him some pats
"""I go, or we all stay"""
Eh, dude's *probably* okay... He was moving his arm and no obvious hemorrhaging. Plus, I think I saw his shoes still firmly attached to his feet.   Source: My ass
The paramedics seem completely unconcerned about the dog flinging itself onto the guy's chest. If he was in serious danger, I suspect that they wouldn't just stand back and watch it snuggle with him.
If humans mirrored their behavior after dogs, this world would be an amazing place.
My brother explained why this really is so sweet :)  Basically its the dogs instinct to protect your partner, because shes wounded and cant fend off predators herself. In a pack of dogs, when one of the pack gets injured, another will stay to protect the injured one from anything that threats it. And you and your partner are your dogs pack :)
My dog woke me up this morning at 4 o’clock throwing up all over my bed sheets.  Good luck friend.  
If you have the space, time, and means, head to a shelter and get one now! Pro-tip, I have 2 pups and put $100/month in to a savings account called “Dogs” and it has bailed me out big time. One pup had cancer and the other had life-threatening bladder stones that needed surgery. Both of these episodes happened within about  12 months of each other. Thank god I had a pretty decent amount in that savings account by the time they had these issues (~5 years old each) I was able to cover the costs with zero impact to my checking account.    Just so you are not going in blind here are some back-of-the-napkin cost estimates: Food = $40/month, vet (Once a Year Checkup + shots) = $300, flea/tick/heartworm = $200/year.  Make sure you understand the costs of a dog before getting one and you are all set!  The one thing I can’t put a dollar amount on is 2 pups going bat-shit crazy when I have come back from getting the mail after being “gone” for 45 seconds. Tails wagging and jumping in to my lap with excitement is something you can’t monetize. When I get some exciting news and start to jump for joy, they both jump in 100%. They have no idea WHY I’m happy but they know I am so THEY are happy too! We don’t deserve dogs.  Good luck!
I am prepared for my down votes!! Their\*  Edit: I am sorry, Borgmaster. I have the day off and decided to look through your history. Your grammar is horrible, but it appears you are a techie and very eloquently have been pointing out how stupid the wall is. I am sorry and you have no need of made up human grammar rules.

My brother's husky bolted and we couldn't catch him so my brother took a prat fall when the dog could see and rolled grabbing his leg yelling for Loki to help him. My dog was super worried and trying to tug on her leash to get to him. His dog stopped, looked back and then bolted again. I let my leash drop and my dog ran over and started sniffing at his leg and licked him until he got up and kept trying to check him out to make sure he was actually okay.  He was super ticked my dog was way more worried than his. Got all upset.
"Can also confirm. I have a half Husky, half Australian Shepherd. She'd use this chance to get into literally everything and anything she could so when I came home a week later and it's a disaster area, she's looking at me like, ""Dad, you wouldn't believe it, everything just started to explode and everything started breaking and... I love you."""
Thank you! I'm not the only one who deals with this!  My Malamute is a jerk. He's my jerk though.
They really are the very best kind of people.
So go full bear regardless. 
my husky let people onto the porch she was sleeping to steal my bike. TWICE. LIKE FUCKING TWICE!!   that said, she was protective of her family... she just didn't give two half shits about property rights.
THIS. Oh my God my entire mouth would be licked clean and every inch of visible skin would be thoroughly washed. 
Thanks I hate it
I read this out of sequence and thought you found that other guys thumb sliver.
"""Its ok, my baby"" oh lord, i didnt need to cry this early in the day. "
Fuuuuuuuuck me that’s heartbreaking. Would’ve ruined my day if it didn’t show the dog happy at the end. My wife got my favorite picture of my dog that recently passed framed with his collar for Christmas and it took every bit not to break down in front of everyone. Miss that dude. But now I see his smiling derp face on my bar every time I pour a whisky and I cheers him.   Edit: [miss ya boy!](https://imgur.com/a/wYHG0EB) 
Every time I see this video I want nothing more than to beat the everliving shit out of whoever abused that dog.
That video destroyed me 
Dogs deserve better than abuse. Animal rights should be just as much a thing as human rights. Don’t adopt an animal if you can’t care for it. Dogs are not toys; they are fragile creatures. Give them the best life you can give them. Do not take advantage of the fact that they cannot communicate verbally.  That’s it. I’m signing up to help at an animal shelter first thing tomorrow.  Edit: I signed up right after this comment. Let’s make this world a better place.  Edit 2: Thanks for the platinum! I really appreciate it :) happy new year everyone, and try to do something that makes the world a better place!
Can I rant about the dodo for a second. I fuckin hate their bullshit format. They are trying to pretend they are something more than reposters by adding... bork effects? And stating the obvious in a video that can be fully comprehended without subtitles? Raking in thousands in adsense for adding just that small bullshit fuck that. Why do people want everything baby fed to them in the most childish manner. highlighting key words as if we are reading a fucking childrens book. /rant.   That is a heartbreaking video though, sad to think there are many more creatures out there that are still being abused.
We always talk about the Good Boy, but we never talk about the Good Man

Your ass is very wise sir
Probably a minor accident where he said his back hurt a bit. Paramedics are required to put you on a back board and in a neck brace if you complain of any neck/back pain post accident.
Eh, you're not that far off, he's conscious, responding to stimuli, and not actively bleeding.     Source: my left pinky finger.
But no one would ever get medical attention lol
"My dog woke me up by tapping my shoulder and staring at me.  Meant ""Poop soon...outside or inside...your choice""  He's a good boy."
God damnit, I'm at work. I'm trying not to cry. 
I live in the US. She is an emotional support animal and the paramedics called the hospital before we left to make sure it was okay to have her with me. I think I got really lucky in that the paramedics were just truly good individuals who concluded that I really would be better off having her with me due to my medical history. 
I know this babytalk stuff is gonna be the ragecomics of this time, but I'm still tickled by it.
This situation terrifies me. If I was in a car accident with my guy it would be ugly. I would most likely need medical attention but my 225 lb ultra-protective Saint Bernard wouldn't let anyone near me. I'd just bleed the fuck out. Thanks Barnaby.
When my cat used to walk in in a mood (roughly 50% of her existence) i'd make a point of trying to stroke her just to see the amazing feat of a cat pancaking itself whilst walking in order to not be stroked. Fucking killed me every time.
Ha
My husky has perfected the art of stopping and waiting so that you can get closer to him and have a false sense of hope catching him, then bolting again with that husky speed and power, leaving you in the dust feeling exasperated. He did it on purpose, every time.
Hmmm. My three year old is a husky. Got it.
Gimme dat good salmon yo  Edit: I don’t know why I think bears would talk like that 
And he took a shit somewhere. I'm on a stretcher so I can't see it. But someone is gonna look at their heels and have a bad smelling car for a couple days.
Is there a reason dogs do this? I can't lay down in my friends house because her dog would do this to me as well. I would feel like I'm on one of those animal documentaries showcasing symbiotic relationships and one animal is getting its teeth cleaned by another.
It's a good cry though. He's so much better now. :)
unless it was a seriously obnoxious person of power on the titanic who was holding up  a lifeboat of children
His ass is strong and wise and i am very proud of it
[This puppy begs to differ.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujUHTbSIT6g)
Oh yeah- my dog does this. She doesn’t whine or bark- she just stares at me and gets progressively closer. Eventually she’ll get her nose on the bed. Like “alright lady- I’m getting close to a situation here and it can happen right by the bed or outside. Your call.” 
No I yelled pretty loud after being woken up and scared him so he ran and hid under the kitchen table.  I had to apologize for raising my voice before I left for work.  I can’t be sure but I think we’re cool now.    Just balled the sheets up and tossed em in the garbage.  He must have known I needed new ones.  
"I know... I love it. I hate that I love it... but goddamnit, anytime I see ""heckin"" or ""scritches"" I can't help but smile."
Wait, doesn't your Saint Bernard always have a barrel of medical supplies and/or Brandy around it's neck? He'd basically be EMS. You'll be fine. 
We had a Saint while I was growing up. She was the sweetest loveliest dog you could ever ask for. One day I was walking her when a couple of shady looking loud and clearly drunk guys walked around the corner. They immediately spotted me walking this massive ball of fuzz and started coming my way, probably just to pet her, but Josephine was having none of it.     A very low but very loud and guttural growl that I had never heard before began to emanate from her, almost like a lion. The two dudes quickly reconsidered and decided to walk on the other side of the street. Never heard her make that sound again, but boy oh boy do I remember it. What a beautiful dog she was.

Dogs, of all ages, basically act like juvenile wolves.  Young wolves lick the mouths of their elders, both as a submissive behavior and to encourage them to, er, regurgitate their last meal, which is basically wolf pup baby food.
Gentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog. Gentlemen of the jury: A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.  If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.     - George Graham Vest
How long have you known his ass? Just wondering
It's weird because usually he will just go if we oversleep because he hates waking us up apparently but when he wakes us up we know what it means. He will usually just crash out all morning on our bed which I'm pretty sure he loves as much as us.  Dogs are fun. Wouldn't trade this one for the world.
It's okay to enjoy things and smile :)
I never saw it as “baby talk” but I see people say that a lot.  I’ve always kinda just thought it was if a dog could speak English.
Yeah I was under the impression that all Saint Bernards are born with an attached medical supply crate that grows larger along with the dog
So, what you're saying is that I should puke up food in order to feed my dog?
Since the anals of history
Damn. I don't know why but that kinda hit me, I should let people do that bullshit if they want. It ain't hurting me or anyone else
"Same, I've always looked at it like ""animal talk"" ."
I never saw it as baby talk. I see it as good boy talk. Understands words, but not the formal language but more importantly even if super serious where anyone would let a cuss word slip, it just comes out as angelic good boy language.
It's a common misconception that the barrel grows along with the dog. Every April, the Saint Bernard seeks out the nearest wild barrel grove and selects a new barrel during the bloom. If they fail to find a new barrel, their sainthood gets revoked and they just become a Bernard. 
If you haven't been doing that already then I have to question your capabilities as a responsible dog owner.
Yup...as long as it ain't hurting anyone else...If they get enjoyment out of it...don't shit on their day.  Life is hard enough.
That's one of the most annoying things about some of my friends, some of them tend to hate on people just having fun in their own ways. Just gotta chill, let people be people
Just dogspeak to me. Like how 'can haz cheezburger' is catspeak. I don't think that's what a cow, or horse, or elephant's thoughts sound like. Just a dog's. 
Nature is a beautiful thing
The same way a Great Dane gets downgraded to Good Dane, then Acceptable Dane, then “Dane*” each time it fails to molt its old legs and grow longer ones.
Like let’s be real, if we look back at rage comics they were funny at the time. Now we’re 5 years and the collective history of the internet later, we’ve altered our memes into a much more ironic but yet more humanizing way, it’s just the evolution of a subculture’s humor (even if the subculture bleeds out mainstream regularly)
I hate on my friends that love puns.  It's a lot of fun.  It makes them share more puns with me.  Which makes me hate them more.  It's a vicious circle.  I love it.
Holy crap, I wonder if she recognizes herself? I wonder if she remembers? It is a Border Collie so I guess it's entirely possible.

Kirk is playing virtual reality dog.
Gallowboob strikes again
Who else heard “boing, boing, boing...” in their head while watching this?
She might recognize the handler and the calls. 
If you watch carefully, you can see that she's reliving the run. She bounces during the running part, is lower during the tube parts, and is going back and forth when she's going through the stick part.  Amazing! 
She doesn't recognise herself, just her favourite activity.
Very doubtful. British scientists have shown that dogs can recognize themselves based on smell but not visually. She may recognize the calls but otherwise she probably just sees it as a person and another dog. 
Who says only human stars can have massive egos?!

I agree. This is such a cooler trait for a dog anyways. I don't care how proper and pretty my dog is while she walks. Agility contests are so much cooler.

This is the real answer, only a handful of animals have shown self awareness (against a mirror) and dogs definitely do not fit into that category.  but this is  r/aww so the other answer is yes she does and she is proud of winning the prize.  Edit : Yes Dogs recognize themselves by smell but that's just besides the point of the whole thread.   You can stop telling me about the smell now thank you.
You’re on r/aww, dog. 
If my dog honestly thought she was seeing another dog every time we walked by a mirror she would be WAY more excited. 
My sister in law has a corgie. They do similar events. The dog is the snootiest diva I've ever seen.
As an Aussie, I will never not laugh childishly when Americans talk about 'rooting' others.
As an agility enthusiast ([here's my dog!](https://youtu.be/KY-oXJH4sYQ)), or makes me so happy people think agility is exciting.  If anyone is reading this and is interested in giving it a try with your dog, I highly encourage it! It's a fun way to bond with your dog, and they really seem to love it. :)

"They kinda can.  There are a lot more dog sports than people who aren't plugged into ""the dog world"" realize.  For terriers, and other dogs meant to hunt vermin, there's earth dog and barn hunt (note: in both of these sports, no rats are harmed - they are just located by the dogs).  For herding dogs, there's herding trials.  For german shepherds and other protection breeds, there's IPO/shutzhund which tests general obedience, tracking, and protection.  For hounds and similar, there's tracking (following a human scent) and nosework (finding certain scents like drug dogs)  For retrievers and pointers and flushers, there's field trials (for dogs that retrieve, flush, and point game)  For sighthounds there's lure coursing.  And then there's also agility, competition obedience, rally obedience, flyball (relay race for dogs), and a lot of others! "

You can honestly build some obstacles, probably buy some of those tube thingies, etc...with time and effort you can make an at home course. Even if you never compete and just do it for fun- it's GREAT for the dogs that like it, and an aussie/border will almost certainly love it.   I desperately wanted to do agility with my Stella (German shepherd/aussie mix is our best guess haha) and she would have been awesome but unfortunately she was born with severe hip dysplasia.  When I eventually get another pup I hope to do it with them 
It's 10 AM on the West Coast too. Don't forget us Americans are used to waking up at 6 am on the daily to sit in traffic for 2 hrs to get to our 10 hr-a-day job, so weekends we're up before 8 anyway.
Damn you!
"Haha, of course.  So, to start, she's always been good at learning the names of things like her toys (frisbee, ball etc) and everyday items like her bowl or leash.  I'm careful to call everything by the same name all the time.  So I basically turned it into a game.  First, I took some rope, knotted it up and would play tug-o-war, and every time we would, I'd call it ""fridge"".  Eventually, every time I said ""go get the fridge"" she knew to get the rope.  Then I just tied it to the fridge handle and boom, got it almost right away.  I'd always have her walk out of the kitchen once she opened it, the idea being that I was (hopefully) setting a boundary from any of the contents unless given permission.  To get her to close it, Id just tap the front of the door, enticing her to put her paws on it and always say ""close it"".  As for the ""beer"", same thing.  I took a thick koozie and just played with her, every time calling it beer.   When she got it down, I put an actual beer in it and showed her that I had put it in the fridge.  I told her to get the fridge, she does, then I'd say get the beer, which she'd grab, bring to me and then go back to close the door.  The one thing that's taken longer to express to her is that dropping it at my feet is bad for beer.  Nowadays I can just say ""get a beer"" and she knows the routine, she's even gotten it to where the fridge doesn't open all the way so she doesn't have to go back and close it.  So it's really more of a trick, unless I have a fridge stocked with beer in koozies.  And no, she's never used her powers for evil.  In fact, had a BBQ one time and had been tossing back more than a few.  Had her do the trick for some friends to see and she instead brought me the milk.  Guessing she thought I had had enough.

That’s one for the memory book to be revealed at a family event 
I had pictures from when my son was born that have my sister's each holding him in one of the pictures. They were pretty young. One was 9 and one was like 4 I think. The security and doctors made an exception for my sister's to be in there even though it was the Maternity Ward because they were such good kids and well-behaved. It was so cute because they both had big smiles. I put each picture in a double frame so I could have it with me always.  It was all so cute because my mom came back to the hospital and said that they wanted to give all their toys to my son lol. They actually spent their allowance on baby stuff that week. So I got new receiving blankets and bottles and all kind of baby stuff from them. They were so excited to have a new nephew. That is one of the most precious memories of my life.
When I was a newborn my older sister yanked me  out of the bassinet with one arm, marched up to my parents and proclaimed “I have the baby!”.  It basically turned into a hostage negotiation to try to get me back without her dropping me. 
Hahaha, my thoughts exactly.
Both facial expressions, actually
16/f/cali, whatcha doin
41/f. Same. Same.  *Please* do not ask me to hold your baby unless we're escaping some kind of a disaster or something.
I imagine my toddler will look similar when her brother is born in a few weeks. She has no idea what she's in for, and, honestly, neither do I
37 yo female. Have been standing and / or walking for 36. the second i’m holding a baby i am 100% certain i will suddenly fly face first into the ground on top of it.
Unfortunately, I was just setting up the shot and snapped a few photos to confirm lighting and positioning.  So no videos of this, but I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities for that.
I'll never let her forget it hahaha.  This pic will haunt her for the rest of her days.
"""Stupid Daikini, I have the baby!"""
When I was a newborn my sister wrapped a string around my neck and tried to strangle me...several times. 
There are tons of photos of my sister (two years older) sitting on my napping dad's chest feeding me my afternoon bottle. He ALWAYS fell asleep and she'd take over. And I guess mom hung out to supervise based on the fact that there's photo evidence.  She was super into me - I was basically a fun dolly. Until I started wanting to play with her toys. Then that shit was OFF.

Even then, 50/50 chance I'm throwing that meat decoy at the zomdbies chasing us.
not to freak you out, but this actually happened to me when walking with my newborn. He was just over a week old and I went for a walk with him in a carrier. Center of gravity is a little different, and I tripped and fell forward. Luckily I caught most of the fall on my knee but he still hit his head and fractured his skull. Thank god there was no brain bleeding or any permanent damage - just a head shaped like Stewie Griffin for a few days, and months of therapy for PTSD for me a few months later (I'm not kidding - it fucked me up royally).      Not sure if I had a point here but this is a 100% valid fear. I would just hold them sitting down, really. 
they can shift their weight remarkably fast. I'm discovering small toddlers are even crazier to hold - I'd rather carry a sack of eels.

Oh nice! I was a few weeks old and my sister got inside the crib and started jumping on my stomach. My brother yelled for my mom but I’m still not sure how I lived....wtf is up with older sisters??   I blame her for all my gastrointestinal problems. 
There was one time my brother transformed himself into a snake because he knows how much I like snakes, and so I picked the snake up to admire it, but then he turned back and went 'AAHH! It's me!' And then he stabbed me.
So cute. 
Wow.  That's awesome lol.  I might print and hang this next to the real photo when I get around to printing all the pictures.  I'm sure my kid will get a kick out of it as well.

> not to freak you out  > he still hit his head and fractured his skull.   Just FYI, you are *terrible* at not freaking people out. ;)  (Glad you and your baby are OK.)
See, now I feel like an asshole. That sounds horrifying but your use of the Stewie Griffin visual made me chuckle. 
" RemindMe! 15 years ""picture remake!"" "
My mom always asked me if I wanted a sibling when I was around 4-6. I would say “I’ll kill that baby” with a straight face everytime she asked. Needless to say, I’m 21 y/o now and still an only child. 
[I made one too. :)](https://i.imgur.com/t63RPqW.png)
If no pockets, use creativity.
"ah you're right!  ...crosses ""motivational speaker"" off career list"
it's ok - it's been a year and he's absolutely fine, and so am I. I learned that babies really are built to withstand our idiocy as parents. I also learned that you get interrogated like crazy if you bring a newborn to an ER with a skull fracture (rightfully so).
Lmao. I’m an only child too and I hated the idea of a sibling when I was a kid, but for some reason I could understand that it wouldn’t be the baby’s fault if that happened. My parents still tease me about my threats because I’d tell them that if they dared to have another baby I’d steal it and run away, so they’d be punished by having neither of us.  No clue why I thought that being a homeless 7 year old raising an infant was a good alternative to having to share my parents’ attention with a sibling lol.
I'm super motivated not to hold any babies. Does that count?
I met my nephew when he was 1 month old.  His older sister (age 4.5) explained wearily to me that “he’s only zero, so all he does is eat and poop.  We don’t know when he’ll be 1”.  
Demotivational speaker! 😂
Here's done a good job, the beside table makes it for me though
And you got a picture of the only time the cat used it? Well done OP!
So the night stand is for things the cat can push off, right?  Edit: Gold? Thank you, whoever you are! What do I do with it?
Did not realize this would blow up. Thank you so much, kind stranger, for my first ever silver! Here are more pictures of Ollie to be aww'd at ❤️ http://imgur.com/gallery/G1hXeOk
Are you willing to share this husband?
Nightstand needs a little alarm clock set to go off at 2:00am, primo running around and knocking stuff over time
That’s awesome!
I have five cats. Does he make bunkbeds?  
Fitted mattress and linen and everything a cat needs! Updoot for the perfect little bedside table.
He’s a keeper
I'm gonna put a fancy ramekin filled with catnip there hahah
Totally! The bedside table is a nice touch. Maybe put a framed photo above headboard and a little rug on the floor 😊
The table needs a solid (but unbreakable) cup/vase so the cat can push it off at their leisure.
LMAO. He's been sleeping on it for the last 30 minutes, but you're right, it'll just be a cute prop tomorrow.
Nah. Put stuff on it the cat likes and when the cats just chilling go over and smack if off the end table. 
For his stash of catnip 
Does he like the bed?
The red solo cup, candle and cat toy on the nightstand. Outstanding.
I have a cat that looks just like Ollie! His name is Oliver, funny enough :)  [obligatory Oliver pictures](http://imgur.com/a/q7DqYEY)  I know a lot of cats have this same pattern but it always makes me happy to see!
Only if he adopts more cats for me. Convince him and we can talk 😂
I snorted. I was genuinely excited to have a new bed frame, but this is way better.
I'm pretty sure they are all gonna lump into one bed, leaving the other 4 vacant for your regrets. 
It's a flattened standard bed pillow with a king sized pillowcase folded over to appear as if it has a top sheet! Hahah
Sounds classy
Your cat has a nightstand. This cat is definitely living its best life.  
Put a chain drive, like a bike chain, on super low resistance. Then equally space two cups, so when the cat knocks one cup off the other is now on the top of the table ready to be tipped again. That way you don't have to worry about the mess of catnip and your mitteny friend will have infinite fun.
"Probably ""bedside"" but got autocorrected"
Add a heated mattress pad. Boom.
Oh ho, how the turntables
Yell in his face until it wakes him up at 2 in the afternoon. If we're wide awake at 2pm he will be too...   Edit: First gold. I shall pass it on. 
Am I too late for the gold   Edit: Nice.
This is the most shocking part for me, the cat used the bed and not some random junk lying around.
Well, if cats are high on your priority list, marrying a guy who builds beds for your cats seems like a pretty good match. 
That’s hot; that’s a hot way to live 
The little nightstand for midnight kibbles is a nice touch.
This guy cats.
The cat has deemed the husband worthy.  For now. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71bIktNSZ1k
I don't even have a nightstand
Can confirm. We bought a heated cat bed. All formerly loved napping locations pale in comparison.   For fun we pulled out an IR thermometer while she was in the midst of a long nap in said bed. The measurements I remember (in F) were that the room was 76, top of cat: 83, tucked in paws 88, fluffy tummy region centered over the heating element: 99. And it's not like she's a sphynx or we keep our house at 60 F: she is a medium haired cat with a warm fluffy tail to bury her nose in and tufts of fur between her toes.
Or in this case a regular size heat pad would be perfect!
Hey happy cake day to you!
/r/unexpectedoffice 
Happy cake day!
Find small but very loud objects to suddenly play with..
What happened and how do I get invited 
It's because OPs cat is a *fancy* cat and not some run of the mill cat.
I can't argue with your math...the cats won't let me
If the cat has a top hat and monacle the scene would be complete.  
I have an electric oil radiator space heater. It is hot enough that I don't want to touch it with my bare skin. Probably not hot enough to blister but still hurts a bit.   My two cats get real damn close to that thing. Like paws stretched out underneath with a head resting on a wheel close. 
I put a heated pad on one of the chairs in my apartment and it's basically my cat's chair now. No one can sit in it. He sits on the pad, all day, every day, unless he's eating or shitting.
Purrfect.
Happy cake day to you as well! 
Happy cake day to you!
No, happy cake day to you!!!  Edit: nice
Never see those on reddit!
Not your common bitch. I can tell you that, just by the picture.
And if he talked in a refined British accent, goin ‘meow’ instead of ‘meow’.
My dog sits in front of my ceramic and wire heater. Its like 200 degrees red hot. I LITERALLY cannot be that close or I actually burn. My dog sits his head under it, but closer. He loves it. He's mental though. 
I’m just happy to be here and see this :)  E: This one’s for you, pops! 
I read it like I was supposed to.
Happy comment day! :)
Happy day! :)
What is this gold day?
That's all folks.
"Not sure...but mine says ""From Your Friends @ WebOas.is""  EDIT--------  Google ""WebOasis"" The site is actually super dope."
Let’s see: guild me!  Edit: wtf wow 😂😂😂
When I first meet Buddy the poor guy could barely walk/waddle without getting out of breathe. He hated the leash and refused to leave his owner’s side so I had to carry him down the street and force him to walk back. Now he loves his daily walks and can even run.  So proud of Buddy!   Edit 1: Thank you for the reddit gold and all the kind words!!!!Y’all are too kind!   Edit 2: The before and after is after 6 months of walking. He gets walked around the block every day. He was a rescue but we think he is a 10 yo chihuahua mix. Also I swear he is happy! He just looks grumpy! 
You have probably added  years to this dog’s life! You have done a great thing here. 
I think you did a wonderful thing and I'm certain you've enriched his life and his mental health and that both he and the old lady you help love you dearly for it.   The photos make me laugh though because in the second one, his squint makes he look like he is glaring into your soul with resentment. It's like he's thinking *'I was happy before you. Fat and happy. I stayed indoors where it was warm and my lily white feet knew only the soft embrace of the finest Persian rugs. But then . . . you came. Now I am ripped daily from my happy home and with my ever shrinking body I feel the bite of autumn's cold teeth. My feet are dirtied, dirtied by the harsh tap tap tap on concrete and the decaying bodies of once green leaves. As green and full of the warm sun's promise as my past was. One day I'll make you'll see. One day.'*
Aww! Good job, both of you- Buddy for getting in shape and you for being a good human being! ❤
r/progresspics needs this
Never thought about dog owners who can’t walk their dogs cause of old age. Must be hard if you don’t have family to help, I wonder if there’s like actual people who have like a group help elderly walk their dogs.
That’s awesome! Your neighbor might also consider feeding Buddy less, which will help him stay at a healthy weight. 
Is there a sub for doggo progress pics?
"In the first pic he looks timid but now he has that smug ass look on his face like ""yea, I look good."" Too cute!!!   You are a nice person!"
From the look on his face, Buddy doesn't look enthused about his new fitness regimen.
T H I C C  B O Y E
If you cut his nails, he will have a lot more of an easier time to be active and stay active. He will also feel a lot more comfortable in general. 
The carrying and walking him back is genius.
i'm Buddy  the dog  n i used to be chubby  some called me a hog  n they said i was tubby  my hooman n i  been together so long  it was hard, by and by  just to walk  me along  i wanted to stay  right by my hooman's side  but a new fren, one day  said 'C'mon, Buddy'! he tried  to get me to walk  down the street once or twice  i liked how he talked -  this fren hooman was nice :)  n now - i am Pleased  cuz i've lost a few pounds!  no longer get teased  by the neighborhood hounds  n as i get older  n i can't quite keep pace  lift me up on your shoulder  hold me close to your face  look into my eyes -   full of Love,  til the end  n Please realize -   You're *my* Buddy - my fren!               
You are awesome.
This makes me happy, my senior rescue is only finally just getting comfy (I’ve had him for a year) he was super tame and docile, thought he was just a forever lap dog. over the last month or 2 he’s been sprinting to go outside and walking with me everywhere, he even started playing with toys!  Thanks so much for helping not only the old lady but the dog
Man you’re a real one that is so amazing r/humansbeingbros af
OP has an awesome soul 
And with that, perhaps added years to the owner’s life. It’s quite common for older people to deteriorate after a significant loss.  Bravo, OP. The world needs more people like you.
Lol that was a great read
Chihuahua owner, can confirm. Those little feet walk the fastest on the way back home on every walk we take!
What a great transformation!! Goes to show that it starts with a simple walk 
I tried but they don’t allow dog transformations so I thought r/aww might appreciate it instead 
There's a few websites where you can request help or offer to walk, borrowmydoggy I think is one
Older people tend to over feed their dogs a lot, they just fill up an entire bowl for the whole day which is usually way more than the dog need. That or they have dementia and continue to fill up the bowl because they forget. My grandma has dementia and I am responsible for feeding the dogs, she I’ll ask every half hour if the dogs were feed even if I handed her the bowl and she watched the dog eat 30 minutes later she will ask again.
/r/dogresspics
I had to gradually increase the distance. I started by carrying him down a couple houses and making him walk back. Then he was able to go up and down the street. Now he is able to go around the block. 
We did that when we first got our dog. He HATED walks with a passion. So we'd carry him halfway and he'd sprint home. 
I tried that with my dog when she was a puppy, and she would always just end up plopping down on some grass and refused to get back up. So she basically got me to carry her back both ways lol. 
my malamute as a puppy was TERRIFIED of stairs. one day i said enough is enough, and i set her down in the middle of a staircase. i said i dont care if you go up or down but youre doing it by yourself. after a good 10-15 min of crying she walked down on her own.
As silly as these are, the ending brought a tear to my eye. Love your style!
/r/ilikthebred For more of these 
Thank you for making my girlfriend cry (in a good way?) this was great!
That’s some real dedication and selflessness. Kudos to OP!
She actually has two dogs. One is very active, plays fetch, and is a normal weight. Buddy however just wants to be by his human and has no interest in toys. I’m trying to convince his owner to cuts down on the treats but she is stubborn and 90yo. Can’t teach an old dog new tricks (except for Buddy). 
Now the dog will die after its owner. Good thinking
Any kind of social contact (to humans) also has a strong statistical effect on people's expected remaining life span. Just having a neighbour check in regularly will do wonders (on average).
I have to carry our chihuahua to approximately the midpoint of our walk the majority of the time. I've got the border collie in one hand just going psycho about the walk, and the chihuahua in my other arm resenting my very existence until it's time to go home.
/r/dogresspics is where you need to crosspost this.
"So, a pic of YOU and the dog and the 1lb YOU lost with a ""side story"" of the dog. There  now you're within rules."
mmh, unfortunately the elderly aren’t probably most active on websites and applications :(
Automatic feeders are great for this! Set it for twice a day at specific times, all you have to do is make sure the little slots all have food in them.
When my meds were giving me memory troubles I had a weekly chart on the wall like it was kindergarten and the pen taped to it, then I could make sure the cats weren't overfed. Underfeeding the cats is impossible because loud babies who panic if food is 10 minutes late.
I’ll invest
“teach you fuckers to carry my fat ass so far from home again”
My dog sees a leash he's already running to the door to go.
She beat you, but you gotta make sure they learn. My dog used to do the same thing, so I'd just leave him there without food or water for days on end. Poor guy never made it back, but at least he learned his lesson.
> i said i dont care if you go up or down but youre doing it by yourself.  I’m sure telling her this is what convinced her.
Right in the feels!!!
Thanks god, it wasn't just me that my eyes leaked!
Respect !!! 
If she won't cut down on the number of treats, can you get her to cut down on the other meal sizes?  Or switch to smaller/less caloric treats?  There's more than one way to skin a cat....
Well at least she's not too stubborn to accept a neighbor's help. Good on you for taking the initiative!
Looks like OP is about to get a new dog.
Glad I wasn't the only terrible person thinking this.
My shihtzu-poodle will walk for a little bit and then just sit down on the sidewalk and refuse to go further. If you pick him up and carry him a bit he'll go a little further, but then hit the brakes again. He's very stubborn!
People need to get to posting in that sub! I want to see more of these doggo transformations!
Genius idea. I actually lost 125 lbs this past year. I’ll take an after photo holding Buddy lol 
My post was auto removed and I asked the moderators for an exception and they said no. 
"We got an automatic pill machine for the same reason. She kept forgetting she already took the pills so she would take them again (which could be dangerous!). The pill machine tells her it's pill time and she has to push a button to get them out. If she doesn't do that within a reasonable amount of time it calls an ""emergency contact"" to alert them the person did not get their pills. Well worth the investment."
> Underfeeding the cats is impossible because loud babies who panic if food is 10 minutes late.  I’ve never seen a more accurate description of a cat. 
Lol. Most people make doggo voices for their dogs, but I'm pretty sure my Chihuahua swears and uses a Strongbad voice. 
Hahaha yeah that seems reas-   Oh...damn, dude.
Hell yeah, you showed that little shit who's boss.
Hey now! There is no need to skin a cat to feed this dog. That's what horses are for, silly. 
Well at least there are routine check ins...  Im dreading the day that I... smell my 90yo neighbor who never has visitors and has made quite clear, she doesn't need or want help.
I'm only in my 20s and had to get a Sunday-Saturday 1 week pill container so I could make sure I didn't accidentally forget I took my thyroid meds during a 5 or 6am piss run (has to be taken 30+ minutes before food on an empty stomach, so it just works better to take them and go back to sleep)
The real issue is when someone else makes a voice for my pet, that isn't the voice I use. 
Yeah, and if a hungry dog is left with a dead body, there ain't gonna be an open casket funeral. 
Tie the terrier to the chihuahua and report back what happens when a (tiny) immovable object meets an unstoppable force.
Right?  That's not what my dog sounds like, what are you doing Todd?
For real. My ferrets and dogs have very specific voices and dialects.  For instance, Yoshi is a ferret, but his voice is the classic Italian 'New Yorkah'  people think of.   It makes it much more fun when they war dance and play together.
HEY IM WALKIN HERE
My cat bites on of us in the morning if his food bowl is empty, we joke it's to wake us up to feed him but I'm pretty sure he's just saying fuck it and going for food.
HEY IM SLINKING INTO THA SOCK DRAWER YOU LEFT SLIGHTLY CRACKED OVA HERE 
BADA BING BADA BOOM
Mine lays on my chest right up against my face and puts his bottom two teeth into each nostril. That's how I wake up if he didn't get enough food the night before. I take it as a wake up now or I'm eating you. 
He could possibly be the oldest cat in the world
Dude contact Guiness World Records. According to Dr. Google, the [current record holder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_(cat)) (oldest cat that's still alive) turned 31 years old last May.  EDIT: Holy crap, went to bed last night with around 300 upvotes, now it's over 7000. Anyway, to all the people saying that the oldest cat is 38, I am talking about the oldest **living cat,** which is a different record than the oldest cat that has ever lived. OP hasn't stated when their cat turned 31 nor if they had a birth certificate, so I thought there may be a chance this their cat was older than Rubble.
Tiger has lived a longer life than Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin or Amy Winehouse.
Handsome
So do you feed him anything special or do anything to help extend his life?
He sure doesn't look that old.
Wow! Thirty one is an amazing age for a cat! You must love him so much ♥ Give him some pats from me!
Only 90s cats will understand this.
Wow that's impressive. What a wonderful cat! You must love him so much!
What are you feeding him and where can I buy this fountain of kitty youth?
DO YOU HAVE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO PROVE IT?    That's crazy.
Verified as 31?
My Max is 17 and in a bad state, he went blind last week and we are fighting various cancers. I have to practically hand feed him now and constantly cleaning the house as he can’t see his litter box anymore. Had a last Vet meeting last night we’ve decided that this is his last week with us. Very sad.
Kudos to you for taking such good care of him! You have prolonged his life for sure.
"""His feline wisdom is almost palpable."""
Yeh, had to let my cat go last year who was 24. Thought that that was rare already.
It's incredible! This would put him on the list of oldest cats for sure, most of them are around 30  [Also, I'm a novelty account so here's a drawing!](https://imgur.com/tgaZoRz)
The oldest *independently documented* cat was 31.  This was proven with medical records from their veterinarian which had an exact date of the cat's birth.    OP's kitty being 31? Absolutely possible.
For real. There really aren't many cats at all in the entire world that reach their 30s. At 31 he's surely in the top 5.
Unfortunately, not that easy. Unless you have documentation backing up what you’re saying, Guinness won’t just take your word for it on your animals ages. My girlfriend’s family has a dog in Portugal that’s 29 years 6 months old at this point (older than the oldest dog in the world),  but no documentation so....
Tiger doesn’t have a drug problem or greedy jealous wife I’m assuming. All of them are cool cats though.
Amy Winehouse just celebrated eight years of sobriety.
Very much. He still bounces around like a kitten. He's quite a pickyguy though. He only drinks from the shower
He drinks from the showers
There's a guy who has had several cats that have lived to be older than 30, including the oldest cat in recorded history. No joke, once a week he gives them a tiny bit of red wine. There are scientists studying his cats and his methods for caring for them to figure out if that's actually doing something. They're not encouraging people start giving their cats wine just yet though.  He also turned his garage into a cat playroom which has a projector that shows wildlife documentaries which he says keeps their minds active.
Unfortunately, he may not seem young but his body front the rightangle will show it. I believe he has cataracts, a form of arthritis, and he looses fur. He, thankfully, doesn't seem to notice.
Will do! And give your fluffy buddy some Internet pats too!
If this guy is 31 technically he's an 80s cat...
We do!
His fountain of kitty youth is drinking from the shower
We do, I'm trying to find it
By a vet. 15 years ago he was supposed to die. Every five years we were told he would die. We are extremely lucky for him.
You're telling me. He is an indoor outdoor cat. This guy has escaped so many coyotes. Either that or hes just immortal
lol using foxnews for cat facts... it ain't a fox mate
Regular cat food
Hardest thing I ever did in my 52 years of living was put down my 25 year old.  His kidneys just gave out on him and he was in terrible pain. there was no choice. I'm very sorry for your loss. Once you spend a quarter-century with anyone, they are legit family. Four legs or two.  EDIT: Thanks for all the precious metals kind strangers! EDIT (again): I just wanted to take the time to thank everyone for the outpouring of sympathy. I really don't have time to thank you all individually. You have officially overwhelmed me. I would like to quickly say, to those of you who are just now experiencing something similar; it gets better, I swear.
My oldest one to date has been 22. She developed dementia in her last year of life and thought she was a kitten so she was pretty active and chirping.
My grandad died 5 years ago but his cat never left his house probably hoping he would come back. So I went to his house every day since and fed the poor little cat.  The cat passed away last March in my arms at the age of 25.
Sorry for your loss
That's a good run! I'm so sorry for your loss though, losing a cat you've had such a long time is incredibly hard. Mine was 22 or 23 (street cat) when he passed.  My vet had another patient who was 25!  Once I get settled I'm adopting another senior kitty.
[It would!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_cats) Also, dope drawing!! Love your account. keep it up
It's even speculated that Jeanne Calmen, the 122 year old woman, was not who she said she was.  There were claims that she was her daughter (not literally), for the same reason (how significantly longer she was able to live versus other oldest people).
How do you document such a thing?  You could have birth certificate but who’s to say it’s the same animal?
That is true
Cat nip is a hell of a drug
Dark
This will never get old
Well, he's the 31 year old cat, so he probably knows what's best for him at this point haha
https://i.imgur.com/iUIvzCd.jpg
Shit, I'm 4 years older than your cat and have more health problems than a receding fur line and bad eyesight. Seems like he's in great shape!
Well, he is 217 in human years. I'm impressed he can sit at alert like that.
A video of his holiness drinking from the shower of youth would be awesome!
If you do, congrats on the world record.
A vet estimated his age? Thats actually not at all a good basis for claiming he is 31.
Bro can you just say one brand
Just had to put down my 12 year old golden retriever two days ago. Very aggressive lymphoma. Basically falling apart. Still can't believe my best buddy is gone. Such a weird experience.  Overall though, I'm glad I stayed with him. I still regret stepping out for 5 minutes until he passed. But I was there when they sedated him so.  Afterwards, seeing him laying there, just soul crushing. Nothing has compared thus far in my life. But it was good to say final good byes and kiss his nose for the last time. Its fucked up but I opened his eyes just to see them one last time and hope he saw me too.  Just needed to write this out I guess. Can barely get the words out.  Edit: heres a picture of him   https://i.imgur.com/r3VAxIq.jpg  Thank you all for the support :) I didn't think anyone would even read this.
That's real cute and sad
Damn. I had just finally stopped crying. Bless you for doing that.
He didn't lose it he let it go
>Once I get settled I'm adopting another senior kitty.  You're a good person. Since we were adopted by an adult ginger male cat, we've adopted 2 other adult ginger males, each more snugly than the last. We just lost our last ginger male a few weeks ago, and we, too, will adopt another senior kitty.
I'm not sure I could tell the difference between a 100 and a 120 year old person.  They would both look super old.
Yup, exactly lol. Just did a google search, they need a birth certificate (lol)
You have to count the rings.
Neither will she
For real, im about to start only drinking from the shower
thank you
Actually... he is 31 in human years haha
Huh, we just might not have had a good vet then. We are currently digging up the papers for him
Hey, I'm so sorry for your buddy being gone. I'm sure you gave him an amazing 12 years and you sound like a great person
Sorry for your loss friend.  But he will live on in your memory and in the spirit of your next animal.
Put my Lady (12yo G Shep) down 2 years ago in October. I still miss her every day. She was the best girl. So was yours. They're playing together now :) just waiting for us to make it back to them.  Wow... almost 2 years now and I'm crying typing this. That kind of love never fades. <3
Fuck man I honestly don't know what I'll do come the day I lose my best friend. He's all I live for an not sure I'll be able to go on.
She had a really rough start to life (dumped at a public beach with her kitten, they were chased by dogs until my mom rescued them) so she was always standoffish and cautious of people and other animals. She also couldn't stand to be held so when she developed dementia it was like she was free of those traumas. She ended up spending most of her time in my arms purring and making kitten chirping sounds. She also played with cat toys which was interesting because she'd never shown interest in them previously.
You count the wrinkles, just like tree rings.
The theory is that the real Jeanne Calment died and her daughter assumed her identity in order to dodge inheritance taxes.
"I've never had a dog that didn't come with that documentation from the breeder.   I assume cats are the same...  But where I'm from,  you get cats for free in a box that has ""free"" written on it at the end of someone's driveway.   Farm life :)"
Good way to at least see the age of 31
It’s been sitting in my random image folder on my phone for a long time, needed to share it somewhere 🤷🏻‍♂️
I'm not crying, my eyes are sweating.
You'll probably be like me.  I saw it coming a long time ago, I just felt it, and thought damn thats going to be tough.  The thought doesn't even scratch the surface and it will be the most soul crushing experience you'll have.   But.  Keep the pictures. Keep the videos. They'll make you smile when you don't feel like you can. And memorialize him best you can.   It will be hard but you will survive. That animal showed you how wonderful life can be. Its a gift. Treasure it.
I didn't get my mom to sign the permission form for this feels trip
sounds like pet dementia is a good thing  I mean it's lacking pretty much all the tragic aspects of human dementia  edit: apparently that's not the case, sorry to all pet owners who have or had to deal with it
Ensure you cut them in half too... wait..
Yeah my cat forgot his birth certificate when he showed up to my colleagues front door lol
Ahhhhh. That makes more sense then. Piloto (the almost-30 year old dog) was a mutt/street dog that my gf’s grandfather adopted around when she was born.
It's overrated
I don't know what's wrong with your eyes but I'm crying
Its a terrible day for rain
Agree so much with this, after losing our 9 year old french mastiff my family lasted about a week before we rescued another dog. The house was just creepy silent without a furry friend.
Lol that’s a new one! I’m sure Reddit won’t run it into the ground in the next ~~couple of weeks~~ day.
Really depends on the individual case.  Sometimes the animal gets confused and scared.  Some will start howling/ yowling because they can't find their way around their own house or can't find their people.  Often that happens in the middle of the night.
Surely if he has his social security number he can get access to a copy of it?
I'd bet money the current Piloto is actually Piloto II.
As a 32 year old, I wish I could be 31 again.
That’s actually what I assumed, too. But it also doesn’t make sense. There were no kids; her grandfather was around 60 when he adopted the dog and her whole family lives in Canada. Plus, in rural Portugal, they don’t have the same mentality as North Americans; they’re working animals there. I’m inclined to believe the dog is just old as shit
If anyone tries to bully that kid, something tells me #50 gonna provide a different kind of assist
Love the dbl guns at the end!! 
That's very wholesome
I always hear people say that kids can be terrible... Yeah they can, but they can be fucking awesome too. 
Based on the traveling no-calls and the softness of the defense, I'm guessing this is a December NBA game.  White team appears to be the Knicks.
The #50  we need  https://i.imgur.com/z0r8sBY_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium
Get back on D!!!! /s
Awe, are the kids’ jerseys numbered in order of height?  
Always so easy to call out bad parenting... great job in parenting and coaching that #50.
my little brother suffers from spine issues that make balance really difficult. technically, he wasn’t supposed to walk, but by eighth grade he was the “sporty” kid and, while he wasn’t on any sports teams, he loved watching.  his buddies asked him to run in a race for their track and field day, and he agreed. mind you, my little brother can’t run very fast. he sways in the wind and bobs back and forth and typically falls more often than he was run in a straight line. but he did it anyways.  all of his friends grabbed hands and trailed behind my little brother at the race, cheering him on as he crossed the finish line as first place. he went to regionals. i remember when he told us at home that night, he cried telling us the story.   at his graduation, during the valedictorian speech, they mentioned my little brother’s run, and everyone in his class stood up and gave him and standing ovation as he stumbled his way across the stage.  kids like that make my heart so warm. thank you for sharing this. 
Maybe it’s because I had my first child four days ago, but this made me burst into tears. 
How about some love for #44 from the other team, who lays off the defense, claps when the kid scores, then tries to shake hands with him. 
r/humansbeingbros 
He used his girth for good.  As a big guy for my whole life it’s always better to be the lovable big guy than the brutish big guy.  Use the tummy to shield your loved ones.  
I was the little kid in elementary school. I had a friend like #50. To this day not sure why the biggest kid in the class decided to befriend the smallest one. Thanks Richard! You were a good friend. 
My daughter is deaf blind. She had a friend like #50. It made all the difference in her school experience. They even went to prom. 
I love crying at 9:36 AM, hungover as shit 
#50 is already way ahead of his time and many adults. Great example of leading by example. Rock on lil dude 🤙

It’s like that kid who appeared on dr.phil for defending that blind kid who was getting beat up by some bully. 
We had this autistic kid at our school. Super nice kid just off and obsessed with basketball. Dude was a stat savant. Ask him about some random no-name player and ask him how many rebounds and assists he had in 1995 and he would know off hand.  One day I am at lunch and I see him and he has this scrape down the side of his face. I ask him what's up and what happened to his face and he won't tell me. I pry a but more and he eventually tells me this white trash fuck dragged his face along a rolled on plaster wall.  I walk into the lunch room and start marching straight towards the kid and his friends, theres a chair in the way and I grab it and chuck it behind me and break into a run towards this kid. I'm at full speed tackle him off his chair and start to beat this kid. Eventually my friends and some staff pull us apart.  I was always a bit of a troublemaker but more just pushing limits and abusing the spirit of rules but never anything bad so me and the admin got along relatively well. Vice principal asks me what the fuck I was thinking. I told him to go ask Bob, the autistic kid. About twenty minutes later VP walks back in, tells me I get three days of in school suspension. The kid that hurt Bob got a 10 day suspension.   Idk why I felt I needed to tell that story but there we go. That #50 will have little mans back.
Bro even #14 from the other team tried to high 5 him after that, no one gonna bully him

Almost like humans.
They simply don't give a shit about social norms.  If they are aware of you needing help, they will help without second thought.  If you annoy them they go ballistic...
In my experience as a teacher kids will say stupid stuff but if one of them is crying or having a difficult time my entire class can be derailed by every single child in the room attempting to console whoever is crying. Likewise, if they’re having trouble with something 9 times out of 10 someone else will swoop in before I can and offer assistance. Kids are clueless but pretty wholesome guys. 
I got a belly laugh from this
Did you really draw this? Cuz if so its amazing! 
Yeah he's great on offense but just a complete liability at the other end of the court.
Came here to say this lol
Yes they are
And look at #14 (opponent team) - at a minimum, he's respectful and a good sport. His parents did well, too.
Just what I need for my dry eyes. Tears.
Maybe it’s because I had my last child 12 years ago, but this made me burst into tears, too.

Although he's cold blooded, he probably finds that it feels very safe and maybe the fuzziness feels good too.  He might find it a fun little hiding sleeve, or he might actually find it comfortable.  I think he's adorable!  Merry Christmas! 
Spaghetti looks like a very civil serpent.
I wanna see that in action
Spaghetti is a perfectly appropriate name for a danger noodle.
Snuggly snek
My cornsnake's name is Ziti!
Can he slither with it on? It looks like he would slide out.
Holy Crap!  I didn't expect this post to blow up like it did. My sister just learned how to crochet about a month ago and she made me this for Spaghetti. Best gift ever!  On behalf of Spaghetti, Thank you so much! And thanks again for the gold! Completely unexpected.  Thank you! This made my Christmas!
So cute, too bad sweaters don’t work on snakes ;) 🐍

Aw, Spaghetti is a cute name for a snake!
Spaghettis lookin a little al dente 
 Coziest. Danger noodle. Ever.

Ok... I hate snakes and that's the cutest damn thing I've ever seen. Bonus cute points for naming a snake Spaghetti.
My noodles name is Spaghetti too! She's a girl though, and she doesn't have a sweater
I hate snakes but this is so cute I can’t believe it. 
is it just one strand of spaghetti?
Spaghetti the snek    Adorable pet    He's small and he's long   And as cute as they get     For Christmas this year    They made him a tube    A sweater of sorts    For he gets cold too
He's got a sweater on his snake, Spaghetti
Wearing a new Christmas sweater with no regretti
Her palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's a snake in her sweater already, his name's spaghetti
To eat mice, but he keeps on forgetting 
I just kinda put his head in one end and he just wiggles to the other end on his own. I just hold the sweater in place while he works his way down. He stops just before his head pops out the other end and just chills in it. Then after a few minutes he'll pop his head out.
Most adorable bite pipe I have ever seen
Don't cold-blooded animals seek heat though? I guess he won't be able to warm it within?
Assssssssstute obsssssssssssservation sssssssssssssssssssssssssssßsssssssssssssssssir
Yes, OP, please :D /u/Rancor_Emperor, is a video of Spaghetti and his sweater possible?
Is not a danger noodle, is friend :-(
That's not a danger noodle, man. It's just a regular squiggly boi.
Her palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's a snake in her sweater already, his name's spaghetti
yeah, he's already getting phone calls for sponsorship deals
Hell yes to Pasta sneks.
He crawls inside of it and just sits there. after awhile he works his way out. Its more of a cozy sleeping bag if you want to look at it that way. Its the principal! 
Yeah but he's just been sitting in it lol.
They do a little bit...they slow heat loss.
SNOODEL
I thought that spaghetto is the singular of the spaghetti noodle.
Username checks out
Ready to go party, confetti

It's a similar technique to anesthetizing snakes for surgery. Introduce long tube, let snake wiggle into tube, close off ends, add happy-sleepy-time-gas. 
I never thought I’d think a snake was actually cute. lmao. 
that is such an adorable decision
The question now, is if he thinks he was given an article of clothing or a new mobile home
That’s a new one  Someone should make a list of our nicknames for sneks 
"They seek heat if they want to warm up. The ""blanket"" doesn't produce heat though so it wouldn't warm the snake."
like the esset that ssssnuck in there.
https://youtu.be/4Q9cW34Aafg  Here you go
Lemme see if I can do something.
But some people are still scared, even if friendly.  I've always wondered if that's because people who are afraid of snakes just assume all snakes bite?  Or is it the lack of legs and a fluffy coat?  I love danger noodles!
I was hoping I didn’t have to be the one to post this 
r/pastasneks
That's absolutely adorable. 
I have this mental image of Spaghetti in his sweater behind a desk, being the principal of Slither High. We just need a rag tag handful of smaller snakes to complete the cast... And one of them needs a letter jacket.
Is he stuck? ^(/s, kind of)
I’m going to annoy everyone with this knowledge thank you.

It's funny you ask    I've been asked before    My poetry lines     *Alright*, nothing more   
His sweater is heavy. But his species is incapable of sweating.

Well, you learn something new everyday.  Happy Holidays!
TIL anesthetizing snakes is a thing...
They can be super cuddly. 
We call ours tube often. Dumb tube if he is not being logical, like when he escaped and wrapped around the radiator built behind the wall and we thought we were going to have to kill him. The wall had holes for pipes and such, so either we waited for hours for him to move, like we did, or let him get in the wall and die eventually. Poor guy has had a difficult life. He was an abuse victim, a vet friend's customer found him in the yard covered in cigarette burns. He's a good tube.
Danger Noodle my personal fave. 
But it does prevent him from losing heat as quickly right? Like his body temperature would go down more slowly 
ßßßßßame
The music made that video 100x better 
Okay, who was the little shit that left the “Reddit anyone?” comment?
Is it wrong that the recommended video showed noodle recipes
I think they've said its an instinctive fear inherited from our ancestors? I could be full of poo though
Thank you, I thought so too
^/sssss^sssss^sss
He's pretty mobile, he's crawled out of it a few times. When he's in it he pokes his head out of one end and just kinda stays there for about 5-10 minutes then I'll start petting the sweater and he'll start to crawl out of it.  The sweater is new for both of us, I'm just getting a kick out of having the equivalent to a dog sweater for my sneak.
Have you seen a snake trying to knit? I would imagine it would take at least three. Two to be the needles and one to hold the wool. 
I actually learned it from a joke:  Where do poor meatballs live?   In the spaghetto
> mammamia!  He checks out guys.
Only good at shredding some skin
Underrated comment 
r/nocontext worthy?
To you too! One other little tip if Spaghetti sheds his skin, but his eyecaps don't come off: wrap a bit of scotch tape around your finger, sticky side out. Then a *very gentle* little touch to his eye should get it. If it doesn't work, give it a couple days and try again. 
TIL snek surgery is a thing...
A large number ssssssuffer from ssscoliosssiss.   But seriously, everything from traumatic injury to respiratory and reproductive disorders. Gastrointestinal obstructions, parasitic infections, pretty much anything you'd expect in other animals - except leg surgeries :) [enjoy](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/exotic-and-laboratory-animals/reptiles/management-of-reptiles)
I got my snek a boobjob for her birthday.
Snake cuddles will kill you with cuteness and constriction, but’s totally worth it my dude.
I wonder if they actually like the cuddles or if it's just warmth to them and nothing else.

That is hilarious.  But I am impressed, despite not expecting to fall that far, the cat handled the landing like a champ.
Your cat had a lot of confidence in that invisible table.
I love how the cat is just playing it off, like “alright whiskers, just act normal and pretend like you didn’t just pass through a glass table...” 
I used to have the same desk. Actually frequency in which it needed cleaning is why I got a new one haha  Edit: Apparently most of Reddit also owns/has owned this desk at one time or another. 
"""I don't understand... Normally I levitate here. HAVE MY POWERS BEEN TAKEN FROM ME?!?"""

He unexpectedly fell like 3 times his height and landed perfectly. Really makes you feel like a dumb piece of shit for falling down because you didn’t realize there was one more step.

She has (often misplaced) confidence in everything she does.
Looking at the other side, it was a glass table. Table looks exactly the same as usual to the cat.   You can also see the pieces to the left against the wall. 
"""I meant to do that."""
"""Alright, I can move through glass now..., thats abnormal.."""
Me too. Mine needed to be cleaned monthly... That was until it randomly exploded with my $300 monitor on it. Now I have a wooden one.
I had it too. I sprayed the glass with this stuff that made it look like frosted glass, which hid smudges excellently and actually looked really nice. But then it exploded.
it's probably the wrong color sun
“I HAD A SYSTEM JERRY! GODDAMMIT!”
Touch, smell, jump, rub up against it?
I love when it taps the edge like “I swear there’s a surface here!”
"""We're smarter than this."""
Tbh it looked like the cat planned for both scenarios when it jumped. It probably would've landed on the table if it were there, but didn't stumble or anything when it wasn't.  It's pretty amusing to see cats always landing on their feet
*Ah yes a pressurization attachment device which appears to not be attached to anything. Just as I suspected. Meow.*
Animals may not be intelligent in the way that humans are, but that doesn't mean they entirely lack intelligence either. So it's always fascinating to watch animal behavior where it's clear that there some gears turning in that noggin.
"He was playing it off as if he meant to do that.  ""yep, those silicone sucky things seem sturdy to me""."
“I wonder what other incredible powers have been bestowed upon me...”
How goes the wooden monitor?
Monthly? I had to clean my glass desk every 3-4 days because of all smudge and visible shit that accumulated on the glass. It's annoying af. I had a wooden desk and I only had to clean that shit like every 2 months.  Never get a glass desk for your workspace folks
Why does everyone keep mentioning it exploding? I got a lot of expensive shit sitting on mine right now. 
"""LOOK JERRY!!! THE WEIRD CIRCLES ARE HERE, WHERE'S MY TABLE!!!"""
That's what happens when you put all your points into agility and none in perception
*Hoomans and their malarky*
I love how when cats fuck up they always try to make it look like they planned it all along. Like, they trip over then fling their leg up and start licking their ass like they only stopped to scratch. 
Animal intelligence tends to be more specialized. Cats are smarter at their specific kind of spatial reasoning than any human could ever be. And we humans are smarter at existential crisis. Ain’t evolution grand?
Mine always do that.   Cat: *Does the dumb*. Clatter. Thump. Me: “Nice going, Princess Grace.” Cat: *Avoids my gaze and nonchalantly licks his knee one time in a ‘blow it out your ass, hooman’ kind of way.*

It’s just a wooden picture frame with a picture from playboy in it. Just as good as most computers. 
Their problem is that they don't document their experiments.
I unfortunately did the opposite... I put all mine in perception but none in agility.  I see the stairs, I understand the stairs are there. But I still manage to fall down every single step.
Khajiit does not understand this strange remark
Yeah, but little kids break the most fundamental rules just to piss everyone off, so they don't count.
"I enjoy the idea of a cat that can't pronounce ""humans"" but uses words like ""malarky"" regularly."
Just cats? I pull the same move on a daily. If I trip and fall, I ain’t getting up all willy-nilly. I go straight to casual ass licking and save myself the embarrassment.
Huh? The cat seems to fully understand that the glass is invisible. Otherwise it wouldn't have tried to jump up onto a desk with no visible surface to land on.
You know, I'd actually like to see a monitor with a wooden picture frame. Not just a regular frame slapped on of course, but I feel like something nice and elegant would look interesting.
And how are they supposed to do that,  Greg?   They don't have THUMBS.

The afterthought fist bump. “Oh ya, I need to do this to keep you happy.”
Interesting behavioral detail:    When offering the hand to the chimp the guy does so with the palm upward, between apes that's a sign of submission and the chimps accept it by stroking the palm with the fingertips.  This chimp considers this human a superior in hierarchy and holds his hand from under to show so.   Edit:  Thanks for the gold and silver, so far this is my most upvoted comment with difference.  As some of you have requested [here](http://center-for-nonverbal-studies.org/htdocs/10301.html) is a source, more specifically in the point 6.2 says:   ' [...]  Similar palm-up signals have been studied in great apes. Chimpanzees (Pan paniscus and P. troglodytes) use palm-up signs to beg for food, invite bodily contact, and request aid during conflicts with other chimps. [...] '
The fist bump at the end killed me
No tail bro  He an ape
The way he gently goes to hold the guy's hand.... Awwww
Man he must’ve  developed a very strong relationship with this guy in order to do that. I always think of that woman on the east coast who had her face ripped off... gives you kind of a reality check when working with these animals
I don't know how videos like this can exist and there are still people who don't believe in the truth of evolution. That is a video of two incredibly intelligent, incredibly dextrous animals that are barely any different than one another. It is absolutely stunning how similar chimps are to human beings and how well they seem to understand how we try to communicate with them.
ChimpanzeeBro

Not monkey. Ape. Monkeys have tails. Cool vid tho.

"""God, humans are so weird and needy"""
"That's exactly how my 13 year old son reacts when I go to fist bump him. ""Yeah, right, whatever..."""
I went back to rewatch it. I thought it was an awkward hand placement trying to figure out hpw to grab the hand.
Wow, thanks for this, Very interesting!
Yeah I saw James Franco do this
Yes. I do this to my cat since I'm his slave.
But if an ape is raised in captivity would it know that showing the palm is a sign of submission? Genuine question by the way, not trying to be an asshole.
I saw that in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Actually kind a cool it’s accurate :)
It was a very bro fist bump
Don’t be fooled that chimp would devastate you for a pile of bananas
Big difference.  Some chimps hunt monkeys.  It's pretty metal.
If it doesn't have a tail it's not a monkey  Even if it's got a monkey type of shape
Find you a man who holds your hand like this ape does
Yeah but that stupid woman also gave that monkey beer, cigarettes, energy drinks and all kinds of other stupid shit.
I have read that young (not adult) chimpanzees are friendly, sociable and compliant. Adults are not, and must be handled carefully. Most chimpanzees that you see interacting with humans are juveniles.
Apes are all ridiculously strong that’s just how they evolved we got virgin big brains they got chad big muscles
Google Chimpanzee without fur.  They are almost literally 100% muscle.
More like people who don’t believe animals are intelligent, have emotions, feel pain and some don’t believe they are even sentient.
Kind of off topic but kind of not, it blows my mind that people are so ignorant to evolution considering we're not the only human species to have walked the earth. The Homo Erectus species of humans were around much longer than we were and we lived alongside eachother for years.   People are just so oblivious to the world we truly live in, they live in the world they have fabricated for themselves.

Imagine if we hunted things that looked like us but with tails and weird faces. And then we ate them. That'd be weird.

"""Chad Ape vs. Virgin Human""  Can someone with artistic talent please make this in the proper meme format?"
But they lack the fine twitch muscles which allow us to use tools in intricate ways, enabling pretty much every development man has accomplished over them.
Not only that, but they (and all the other apes) have different muscle fibers that make them a lot stronger than us pound for pound. Our muscle fibers are more tailored towards precise movements. A chimpanzee would never be able to sew, or do calligraphy, which may be comforting to think about if one is ever tearing your arms out of your sockets.
why the fuck did you think this was okay to spread
#WHAT THE FUCK  CHIMPANZEES ARE FUCKING JACKED AF I CAN NEVER UNSEE THIS
All I’m getting are pictures of Bert Kreischer
Jamie pull up that picture of the hairless chimp
Learn to be butt naked
I'm fairly certain my girlfriend only keeps me around because I can (and like to) cook.
Let me tell you, it *definitely* translates to your comments online as well.
"I know ""monkeybro"" is in the title, but it's an ape. Monkeys have tails."
He strong AF!
I laughed so hard I almost passed out 😂. Chimp senpai please devastate me.
Ehh, some people eat monkeys...
He was also an adult chimp. They're extremely aggressive and will always try to dominate.
Ok let me ask this in a less assholey way than the last guy lol   Would neutering them fix that? Yes leaving them alone is obviously the answer, I promise I won't go buy a chimp, I'm just curious if that works.
>(Note: Even though Tango was used to sell Tang® and other products such as Budweiser®, none of these companies have ever contributed to her retirement or long-term care at the sanctuary.)  Hmmm
Read this as autistic
Also their memes are shit tier.
>But they lack the fine twitch muscles   Yeah that's why you don't often see apes competing in OWL or IEM. You do see plenty in Fortnite though.
it's a good thing you did see it, adult male chimps can casually exert 1000+ lbs of force with one arm, they humiliate roided out human bodybuilders in everything with ease, they could tear your arm off with an accidental handshake
Learn? Psh, I could teach that class.
Fully aware of it.    Come, let us watch the downvotes grow, together.
"I grew up in a considerably ""urban"" area near Metro Atlanta. All of my ""friends"" (read that as ""people my older brother hung out with, but I tagged along because reasons"") used a very specific, somewhat similar sounding N-word much like how others use the term ""dude."" I legitimately thought it worked the same way, so that N-word became part of my vernacular; even though my skin tone doesn't have the correct shading apparently to allow it, we were all familiar with each other enough to know it had no racial implications whatsoever.    Fast forward about 10 years, and two moves - one towards a more rural area where the word suddenly had an ""-er"" at the end of it, and people were just as comfortable wearing bed sheets and setting crosses on fire in people's front yards, then back to a more urban setting - and I quickly learned I wasn't supposed to be using said word so familiarly.    Being ""stuck in my ways,"" and having enough problems with communication as it were, I reverted to saying ""ninja"" instead, due to the anonymity, usually perceived positive implication, and peppering said word in conversations usually garnered the same response as you just had (I just typically forego the explanation,) but it was just part of my vocabulary. Needless to say, it's worked a whole *Hell* of a lot better than that other N-word up to this point in my life."
Apebro
He deadlifts like 300 lbs and squats tonka trucks
An average chimp has the strength of several full grown human men.
Oh yeah.... I forgot about that. My step mother has mentioned eating monkey brains before. Man... no thanks.
Not sure why you're being downvoted. It's called [bushmeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushmeat), and the practice kills loads of at-risk or endangered species.
That’s why you gotta hit them with the T pose from an early age
Also I'm pretty sure she wasn't trained to handle him in any way whatsoever.
Yeah. I seem to remember a story about an aggressive chimp at a zoo that kept throwing stuff at the guests. Once they neutered him, he calmed down.  It's an interesting read: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chimpanzee-plans-throws-stones-zoo/
Both would be fine
I would get an A+ in your class
You're up, now! You're either in the clear, or this will be as fun as watching the stock market!
Pull that up Jamie.
Name them
In a lot of places the monkeys are still alive when they are served. It's fucked.
i like the way you think
And don’t give them Xanax, remember that
The monkey was owned by her neighbor. The victim did absolutely nothing wrong, all she was doing was visiting her neighbor.
Most of the chimps you see on tv are young chimps, which are not nearly as hardcore. They don't try to remove your face or genitals.
"I bet that would calm the rest of the chimps down too.  ""Don't throw that rock, didn't you see what the humans did to the last guy?"""
Because they aren't really into bananas. Give them some beer or a cheerleader to compete for and make the test even.
How would the scoring work, would you get scored on how nude a person is or how good a person is at being nude. If the second option how is one good at being nude, and how god damn high am I that I’m legitimately trying to think of an answer to this  Edit: Thanks for the sliver!! Its my first award on Reddit.
Yay! Hopefully without as many WASPs and quaaludes!    ...actually the quaaludes can stay. For science.
Gaston. Squee. Donkey Dong Doug.
Temple of Doom shit right there. Nope
Ok yeah but did you read the T pose part
These are all very good questions. I guess we just have to sit down and wait for the teachers notes. All I know is that I'm getting an A
She is too adorable!!!
They got her a gift, too! Aww! 
She seems nice 
Be kind to people. Love them.    They are hurting and they need it. 
Awww! I just want to hug her and wish her a happy birthday. Too cute.
After all those “Oh gawd, mum no” birthday cake surprises, I’m glad to see one that’s more me. My childhood was awful, I never actually got to celebrate my birthday, closest was one time where they wanted to take pics for family members, so they decked the table with food and made me sit prettily. No birthday party, even today at 28.  If someone would surprise me with a birthday party or even a cake, I honestly think I would cry.  EDIT: Wrote this right before going to bed, and waking up to this was, well, I cried in the bathroom. From kind messages to offers for proper mothering, it’s all amazing, and somewhat overwhelming. I’m not exactly used to anyone paying me any mind, and now I’m crying again.  I will reply to everyone who messaged me, but for the moment I’ll say this: Because I live in The Netherlands, and nowhere near many of you, I won’t be able to take you up on your offer for a party or being my DJ. In this case however, the thought most definitely counts. Thank you very much.
The best birthday surprises are the ones you don't expect. Once I remember punching in at work and the machine playing happy birthday. It was just a machine but it somehow meant a lot to me in that moment.
I miss my Grandma.
Oh my God that's so adorable my heart hurts. I have a vague lump in my throat and I want HER TO NEVER DIE OR FEEL PAIN 
This is definitely r/wholesomegifs material 
I lurk typically 24/7 but I've had a few drinks because it's Friday and I just have to say her face made my night before I even went out.
Some humans just look like they are so kind/heartwarming and that lady definitely looks like one of those people!
She still has the childlike wonder.
Our elderly need this kind of attention. They're lovely and mostly lonely people.
She looks genuinely moved by this, very good wholesome stuff.
This made me so emotional. 
I hope I end up with a wife like her when I'm old. 
You can literally feel the British
Do you see that lady in the background mean-mugging her? Must be jealous that her coffee cake wasn’t free ;)
Nice gestures when you completely don't expect them are the best. Especially on your birthday! This is great.
Oh so this is what’s gonna make me cry today 🆒
Last night at Walmart I was looking down an isle to see if what I was looking for was down there. Guy in front of me wasn’t moving either and had this interaction:  Guy: “oh. I’m sorry”  Me: “it’s okay I don’t know where I’m going”  Guy: “neither do I ..... in life”   Me: “same”  I’ve never felt more connected to anyone 
This is so painfully true, it hurts. My job involves looking at the medical records of elderly patients damn near all day. Almost every one of them is clinically depressed, and it breaks my heart.  Hug your grandparents if you can. They need it.
"My daughter's ""The Nice Book"" says, ""Look after someone little. We're all little."" I nearly cry every time. It's so true. "
"I watched a TED talk about how someone once almost became a school shooter. He said, ""Give love to the people that deserve it the least, because they need it the most."" I will never forget that quote."
I love you
"Where do you live? I need a ""kid"" to spoil. My adult children just don't care all that much."
I totally feel that. I was having a rough birthday and decided to play some pokemon. Apparently on your birthday when you go to the pokemon center to heal your pokemon nurse joy will wish you a happy birthday and that honestly made me so happy.  It's the stupid shit that gets you.
I miss mine, too. *Hug*
I miss mine, too.  She would make make brownies and hide them to save some for me before my cousin ate them all.  <3
Aggressive wholesome. I like it. 
I hope you do too. 
Hope you do too! My wife reacts this way when people are super nice to her. One of the reasons I married her - she’s a grateful person!
I hope I end up with a man who wants to end up with a wife like that when he’s old. 
Could be resting bitch face.
Probably just pissed they're filming and praying a video of her eating soup doesn't go viral. No one looks good eating soup.
When's your birthday? I'm going to gesture nicely to you 
Dude I just hopped on to reddit for a funny meme or two before bed. Not to get my emotions brutalized. 
Reminds me of one customer that said she was confused about something, so I asked what it was. She said “Life in general”, and I responded, “same”
I’m a 31 year old ex convict with prison tattoos on my face and cornrows.  This made me weep  Edit:  I was being facetious because dude above me has to point out how “manly” he is and to be able to cry with it must be a thing or something.

"I had a similar experience with Animal Crossing. , A few of the villagers (the ones that are your ""best friends"") throw you a birthday party. It was a pleasant surprise to be congratulated in-game"

I am a serial killer fresh off another sick ass murder.   I spend my Friday nights drinking gasoline and cutting off pieces of my own flesh to smoke.   I once snorted a black widow, naked, with a katana shoved straight up my taint.  When I was 15, I joined the Bloods, Cripps, and the KKK.  I had a hand in 9/11.  And I just fuckin' bawled my eyes out. 
sobbing my eyes out over this sub (as I do anything healthy mom-child relationship related) bc my own mother is a narcissist. bleh. 
"Ahh and they have you make a wish (that you freewrite in) and throughout the year ask you if you got what you wanted. If other people live in your town they even say stuff like ""XXX said they wish for a new car! I wonder if that ever came true!""  My mom and I play in a town together and the villagers told me what she wished for and I got it for her IRL after that and she nearly cried when they asked if she got it. It's literally the cutest, sorry I just had to vent 🌺"
And myself included.   #Big hug!
I, too, want to end up with that guys wife when I’m older. 
This is why half my friends say that they thought I was an complete asshole before they got to know me. Now they just think I'm an asshole 
Remindme! 228 DAYS “do something nice for u/imissmyoldaccount-_ ‘s Birthday tomorrow”  
I ate a bowl of cereal for breakfast.     Without any milk.      I'm crying
Dude. Me too. Read a post about a trans kid coming out. Lost it at the replies. I came out to my parents as gay and it's been terrible. Reading those responses, uhhh, my heart. 
Threesome.  Edit: My first 1k+ comment is from one word.... I love you guys. 
You'll be complete some day my friend.
Whew! That was rough! Six edits layers and MAYBE I got the remindme bot working. Maybe. 
I’m so sorry. If it means anything from a stranger, as a pastor and a dad I affirm who you are and wish for joy and peace for you.
Man, you guys ruin everything
Honestly. They're probably into it. I am.
Nah, it could be a wholesome threesome. That happens : ) 
This thread took quite a turn
That’s my fetish
Nothing wrong with a wholesome threesome

If I don’t see these ducks splashing around in a baby pool within the next few days I’m gonna be very disappointed OP
So what you’re saying is...the mama duck scored herself some free daycare through her adorable babies?
At my old house a family of fucks would roost every year. I even made them a duck house. Sometimes they would peck on the door for me to come out and give them seeds  Edit: I have a pic of the fuck house. Can someone tell me how to post it?  Edit 2: thanks to u/oodie1127 (and others) for the tips. Here’s the link: https://imgur.com/gallery/XIa7tC0
That’s awesome! Does she let you pet them ?
Good haul this year! Please post updates 😊
"**Mother Duck:** ""You know the drill, human""."
How did this get started? Do you consider yourself the grandma of sorts? Are you actually a human sized duck, OP?
That is adorable, and a Bakers Dozen no less! You are Natures friend it seems. How long has she been doing this and do have more pics of the fluff balls?
How does one gain the trust of so many quackers?
If you zoom in on the momma beak it looks like a snake in a duck costume once you zoom back out
I always gave my ducky neighbors oats so they knew that whenever I went out back they were getting fed, and lots of mamas-to-be would nest nearby to get access to the buffet!  At the demands of my family I stopped feeding them for a month or two because they kept pooping on the porch, but there was a significant decrease in the survival rates of new chicks—oats contain niacin, a necessary vitamin for ducks that helps them thrive. After burying so many of the deceased ducklings I snubbed my family’s wishes and got them more oats.  Thank you for being another honorary ducky grandparent!
Do you start to anxious every year waiting for her arrival?
That’s awesome? How did this start?
Muscovy ducks. They are non-native. In some states they are considered an invasive species.
One day, in your most dire moment of need, the sky will darken with the wings of a thousand thousand ducks flapping to your aid.  *The Quackening*, coming this summer to a theater near you.
/u/fuckswithducks might be a little jealous.
So I wonder if when the ducklings are older will the mommas remember your house and try to nest there?   !Remindme 1-2 years
I'm raising a muscovy right now too. We live on a lake and one day I saw a large male adult muscovy attacking a tiny duckling. He was trying to drown it, holding it under water. So I scared it away and the duckling came right to me. Never saw a mommy or other babies so not sure where it came from. We kept it on our porch for a few weeks, feeding it duck food until it was big enough to roam around safely outside. Still not sure if its a male or female because it still 'talks'. I read that at a certain age all male muscovies lose the ability to quack/chirp. I'm guessing it's roughly 6-8 weeks now based off how long we've had it and how small it was when we saved it. It's crazy how fast they grow. It's nearly the size of an adult now and full of feathers. I named it Bubbles, because it survived the drowning attempt. Lol
13? She has definately adopted a few other clutches lol.
Are you Tony Soprano?
I was looking at your older posts and, when I grow up, I want to be you.
Fun fact, depending on how many years this has been going on, this may in fact be a multigenerational learned ability. You see the young females return to where they hatched, figuring that they too will get off a successful hatch.   You may very well be seeing multi generations come thru.
I really loved this. Thank you.
Someone doodle this! :)
Will do. It’s adorable.
Yeah that’s more accurate than you know. When they get a little older she’ll bring them to my house and then fly away for a little ‘me time’. I’m literally the babysitter. She’s never gone for more than an hour but when she first did it I was like, WTF duck?
Shes the cutest little freeloader I've ever seen
Fucklings are the best!
Were they flying fucks?
Yes!! They peck at my storm door
I can't stop giggling at your typo lol
"*fuck house  edit: can't believe I got this much karma for ""fuck house"" in r/aww. I feel shame and pride all at once."
autocorrect usually goes in the opposite direction.
Someone clearly texts fucks more than ducks.
The ducklings get really used to me and my daughter and will eat out of our hands and pet them. Last year I got brave and picked one up, mama was PISSED and charged me. I have learned my boundaries.
Knowing how most duckling families turn out, I’d prefer *not* to get the updates.   Case in point, I lived with a duck similar to this who would always hang out by my house (I guess momma felt comfortable around us since we never bothered her). Every year she would start out with 12 chicks, then a week later it would be 9, then 5, and then if she was lucky a few of them would survive to adolescence.   Nature is fucking tough when you’re not at the top of the food chain.
As long as the updates aren't via /r/cooking
*Someone* wants a night out on the pond with the drakes!
I am in fact 15 ducks in a trench coat
This is year 6, it amazes me she remembers my house. They all make the journey early in the morning from the pond on a golf course down the street and hang at my house and eat and swim in the little pool we put out for them until it starts getting dark and then they waddle back to the pond.   [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/mpjJXcR) another picture of the babies.
Food. Feed them and they will love you.
Dude! You’re right!
I legit worry because I don’t typically see her until she shows up.   And then I worry about her and her babies making the voyage to and from the pond.
6 years ago I looked out my window and saw mama and her babies pecking around in my yard,  I took pictures and didn’t think much of it. Then I saw them again the next day so I ordered some meal worms and cracked corn from Amazon for next day delivery and started feeding them. They kept coming back every day until the babies grew their wing feathers. The next year she just showed up again with her new babies, and it’s been yearly since then.
But THIS particularly sweet Muscovy duck and her ducklings are welcome at my house. I can’t control what happens after they leave but for now they’re welcome and protected.
Whose kids do you think those are?
She does! She’s shown up in the past with 5 and then the next day have 12
Yes! She pecks at my storm door.
Meal worms and cracked corn mixed with a little brewers yeast that’s made for water birds. It’s smells really gross but they love it.
Occasionally one of the ducklings screams ‘you’re not my real mom!’ But for the most part it’s really good.
And we really love this post. Thanks for sharing it really made my day!
This is a once in a lifetime blessing from nature! She has chosen you. Do her proud!! Edit: I meant “once in a lifetime” as in, a person could only expect to have a wild animal choose you in this way, at most, once a lifetime. OP is blessed!
It doesn’t surprise me that you’ve built a relationship with this sweet little mama duck. My husband’s grandfather lived on a lake and every year he’d get two big white ducks that came to visit. He named them Daisy and Daffy, when they were at his house he would call them and they come flying in from across the lake.
You're not allowed to move, ever 😂😂
It's more like, I can't wait to show my bestie my new lovelies.... I hate you because I envy you
Sounds like you’ve done this before so I’m sure you already know, but just in case: be sure to either be out there with them the whole time they’re in the water or provide a ramp/raft for them to climb up on when they’re tired! Baby ducks don’t have the fully developed down/oils to keep them buoyant indefinitely like adults, and can drown if left in the water too long.
Childcare is hard to come by and expensive these days
Wow! That’s so trusting! Amazing!
Next thing you'll know you get a duckling support notice on your doormat.
WTDuck
You're family! You're the uncle/aunt that gets to look after the ducklings for an hour while your sister goes shopping. :)
duck: they are your problem now, suckaaa
Can I pet your fucks?
Genuinely made me lol :)
Not yet. The mom doesn't give flying fucks. Only the earthbound ones.
We had a pet disabled duck and she used to peck on the patio doors when she could see us in the house so we'd go out and snuggle or play with her. Her and our cat were great friends.
Never seen it happen that way around
Hahaha I would have done the same thing.
"although I feel it's kind of cool that she still returns. like, it was literally a ""not *that*, human!"" thing. but not a complete dealbreaker."
She likes you, but not *that* much.
Damn. How much you got billed for?
So to get people to learn boundaries for my fur babies I just need to get pissed and charge?  Noted.
I just tell myself they duck off when they're old enough
That happened with a fox family mom gave birth to under my gazebo this past year. Started out with six pups. As she started taking them out further and further to teach them things, they started getting picked off. It was horribly sad.
Chickens are the same. I used to rescue lost or abandoned ones at my grandparents farm. They were usually helpless cases my family told me not to bother with, eg I found one soaking wet on the floor, stone cold, no signs of life but I just had a feeling. We put it in the oven to warm it up and it was alive and survived against all odds. We put it under a surrogate hen.   Most of them ended up drowning in water butts/buckets. Stupid birds.
That's how she ended up with ducklings
Vincent Aduckman
There are very smart birds. If you keep feeding them, and letting them chill in your pool every day, maybe one of those little ducklings will claim you as a friend when they mature, and decide your place is home.
That duck was a person in a former life and you two knew each other.
You can officially never move now. Either that or you have to put it in the paperwork when you sell that the house comes with 1-14 ducks per year.
legit aww. ♥
Ah. Meal worms. Crack for ducks. And blue tongue skinks.
After reading more of OP's comments on this post it is getting even more cuter.
LOL yep I've seen ducklings swim between 4 different clutches back and forth and the parents just like whatever.
Gonna need a post every year now. Thems the rule!!!
More like an annual blessing from nature, haha.
without at least writing it into the paperwork of whoever they sell to that they have to take care of the ducks
I didn’t know that!! Thank you, I’ll make a little ramp.
I love sweet and knowledgeable people on Reddit looking out for everyone. thank you 💙
"Well, all kiddie pools say ""children must be supervised at all times""..."
When I was 12, my grandfather gave me a runt gosling that I named Peep. It followed me everywhere. I didn’t know this fact about needing a ramp and found it drowned in a baby pool I had left it to swim in. I was heartbroken.
“You think raising ducklings is expensive? Just wait until you see their *bills*!”
Duck care is even harder to come by because not many people know duck CPR
Everything I’ve seen of ducks they aren’t particularly good parents. There is a reason they need to have a batch of babies every year.
Good thing her children eat like birds.
Yes, just don't fuck my pets.
Username checks out
“I’m not comfortable with that but he means well so I won’t totally spazz.”
"animals can communicate with each other on a basal level... we are animals.. hence. yes! someone does something you don't like, if you take a few angry steps towards them and raise your arms and yell ""RAUYHYHHHYHUHHH!!"" and stop in front of them and glare and stomp your feet.. they'll know what's up. doesn't matter if they're another human, a dog, a goose, a bear, a hawk.. it'll work.   may not be advisable but it'll work."
All I’m saying is you don’t piss off a mama
Just ducking around somewhere
That's literally why most animals have litters. Increases odds of special survival.
You put a chicken in the oven... and it got better?
WTF is a water butt? And how can I drown in one? Asking for a friend.
Can you imagine if OP taught 13 ducklings to cook
The duck ~~whisperer~~ quackerer.
I feed them meal worms and cracked corn with a little brewers yeast. I tried grapes and peas but they had no interest. Squirrels like them though.
We have one! They just get in anywhere they fit.
It depends honestly. I’ve had babies show up in May, and I’ve had them show up late late in September.
I want daily duckling updates!
Or just giving the duck her new address. I mean they migrate hundreds of miles every year it is not like she cant just fly across town next year instead.
You know what? I don’t know you and perhaps never will, but you are a good person,  so you can count me as your friend.
"""I'll make a little ramp"" is the cutest thing ever said"
This is my favourite sentence on the internet so far.
Ducks as young as these also will require small human kisses to help their circulatory system.
Nice
It’s the duck of the draw.
If you ever make the mistake of acquiring a bird, you'll soon learn they eat like starved pigs.
Thats what the fuck house is for!
😏
It sure fucking does.
Great. Now I have a meeting with HR.
Sadly, some of them end up selling quack to pay the bills
Yep. Fish don't make babies by the thousands so they can overcrowd the ocean
It did. Only my nana helped, and I don’t think she thought it was alive but that’s always how she used to revive chicks that had got too cold outside. She died this year and I miss her. She always put up with me rescuing things.
"when i did some volunteering at an animal rescue, the baby ducks were given the bird feed stuff (with the gravel stuff for the gullet, I forget exactly what it was called), and greens.  Literally throwing in a bunch of lettuce and such that they ate in the pool.  I tried giving ducks at a pond lettuce once and they were like ""wtf is this garbage??"""
Said the duck
Should be in the manual for anyone putting a body of water into the wildlife. Frogs, lizards, ducks, snakes, or gators, something is going to climb in and get stuck.
Can confirm, I'm a duck
They make em to feed the other stuff in the ocean too! Lol
What did the hippo say?
We accidentally trained our cat to rush to the bathroom when he felt queasy and only puke in the easy-to-clean linoleum area. Might not work for every cat but it was incredibly convenient.   Whenever we’d hear the telltale “kitty about to puke” noise, we’d freak out and run to grab him and carry him to that spot. One day, we noticed he had started rushing there by himself, having understood and accepted that this was where the puking was to be done. He continued doing it right from then on.
what does the fox say?
Who built the Stonehenge?
Who let the dogs out?
I love this so hard. The derpy half smile is totally what makes this photo.
Her name is Jade and [here's one](https://i.imgur.com/10mIjOw.jpg) where she looks less derpy  I don't want /u/The_Phantom_Fap 's contribution to go un-noticed, so [here's the edit he posted with lasers](http://i.imgur.com/NMC7xgL.jpg)  EDIT: now that this thread is finally dying if you want to see more dumb pictures of this cat, she's on IG @heyjadebutt. Be forewarned that nothing else will be as good as this photo. She has peaked
I can’t stop laughing picturing her with the left facial expression in a top hat and monocle like an old time-y villain
If you haven't already sent this to them, you need to secretly get this printed off at least at 8x10 if not larger, frame it, and hang it on their wall without telling them.

Yes!  And the pink ears

They're both really nice but I like the derpy one best.
Now show me one that’s more derpy cause I like the derp

Yes and I'm not sure which face she had when she shit under my bed the other day
Single strobe, through a large diffused beauty dish. To camera right, and slightly behind the kitty  But honestly she wouldn't stop moving so I don't know where the light was in relation to her for these particular frames lol
Hey I'm sorry for what you're going through. If kitties make you happy, I highly recommend visiting your local cat shelter. I visited one here in LA, and there are lots of cats that just want a little love. If you're not in a place to adopt, there's no obligation to. Me and a friend went one time and we just spent 2 hours with cats sleeping in our laps. Great therapy for you and the cats :)
If I babysit the cat for more than 3 days the photos just happen
The cat is currently in my lap, so probably never. I might die here  Happy cake day!
I think it comes naturally with the lighting setup I used. It's slightly behind her, so the light catches her whiskers from behind and gives them that glow (just like if you light up smoke from behind)
"It was a style popular back in the 80s? 90s? idk some time before instagram  Try ""Olan Mills Double Exposure"""
Yes!  And the camera
[Does this help](https://i.imgur.com/WgkL5s3.jpg)
It's not a clean photo, but [here you go](https://i.imgur.com/TN2hyeT.jpg)!  I can clean it up for you later if you remind me
That is better than I could have imagined 😆
You ever do a white elephant gift exchange with this friend at Christmas?  You could save the idea for that.
I love getting fucked up on corn
So awesome! Did you have a black backdrop up??
Cat sitter / photographer seems like a pretty good niche market.  Cat owners would throw their cash at you!
The camera totally made this picture
Very much so! The first time in a long time I’ve actually laughed out loud from a post on here
"Expression of ""you are beneath me"" with a dash of ""who farted?"""
Honestly this whole thread is
'Wanna do a row with me?
Nope just a wall I painted gray!

Ah the age old question; which came first, the camera or the photographer?
Yep, I've seen that face before.
Hahahaha don’t know why I clicked, but this cat is still making me laugh
I'm so happy for these pictures lol. I thought it couldn't get better, and you keep delivering.
She is daring you to say something to her, daring you to say she shouldn’t be chewing the plants
Camera
She likes to sit on the bathroom sink and maintain strong eye contact with me when I poop, so maybe she got it from me
Chimera
Stop making me laughing me plz lol

Just a little more information...  This is the 2nd year I've owned the house and 2nd time I've seen it happen. But basically this bobcat is smaller then last years mom and I can only think that it's actually one of the kittens from last year.  The little space under the roof on the right is actually where she gave birth and the kittens like to sleep, it's pretty decent shelter.  Also, I don't want to do anything more than just put up a camera. Because I've seen a few people suggest building a dog house or something, but they are wild animals and needed to be treated as such and cant get used to humans. Literally last week in another part of town, some guy decided to pick up one of the kittens in his yard and ended up getting stitches. So as much as they are adorable, they are still wild and dangerous!  I have been super tempted to put up some kind of ball up there though lol.  Edit: Wow this post went crazy really fast. Thanks for all the gold and platinum!  I have a LOT more videos of all this but the camera I have up there at the moment wouldn't really let me live stream, I'd have to set up a different one. They leave during the day since they aren't locked up there, but in the morning and afternoon they are usually playing there. If people are actually wanting me to livestream on twitch or something I can probably set that up.
Oh my gosh they act exactly like house kittens 😄 haha and momma yells at the little guy who ventured to far 😍
Was this a huge selling feature when you bought the place? I works pay extra for this feature, as well.
If you don’t mind me asking, where do you live?
"The moms like"" get yer ass down from there NOW!"""
At :50 “GET YO ASS DOWM FROM THERE!!”
They're beautiful, and that was a brilliant idea.
Omg I loved when the momma bobcat yelled at the baby for his shenanigans haha
Man, you need to livestream this shit..
Poor mama cat trying to bathe and her kittens are climbing all over her.  How on earth can you get anything done? My entire day would be spent watching this adorableness!
Wow!  I 💕💕 this so much!   TY for sharing!  Got more?
[You got games on ya phone?] (https://imgur.com/gallery/GUSanil)
"I now know what ""Get down from there!"" in bobcat sounds like"
That, is a special type of awesome
Welp, that's the cutest thing I've seen all week.
The close up on that baby bobcat belly was awesome!lol
Thanks for being such a great host to these guys.  I wish there were more people like you!
>Also, I dont want to do anything more then just put up a camera. Because I've seen a few people suggest building a dog house or something, but they are wild animals and needed to be treated as such and cant get used to humans.  Thank you! Trying to interact with them or tame them would be the wrong thing to do. Let them stay wild, and enjoy filming the next litter for years to come.
Get one of those pet toys with a camera in it
You could try putting out pinecones or another natural item that could be played with by the kittens for some fun without real man-made interference
I’m pretty sure balls and frisbees are native to roofs so you would not be interfering with their natural ways.
I was going to remark on how small she was. I live in the ozarks, and they stay pretty hidden, but I've never seen an adult that small.
I think at least providing a water source nearby (more for the mom I think? No need to get too close) would be OK.  Being wild they should at least get their own food without humans, but water can be tricky, especially in the city where we don't have many ponds due to drainage systems.
Did the previous owner tell you that you have a bobcat nursery on your roof?
She does look like a younger bobcat. Moms will sometimes give parts of their territories to their daughters so you could be right.
Babies raising babies SMH
I would love to see a toy up there, but human-made toys would have human scent on them.  I wouldn't put any water or food up there as it would habituate them to the area.  It's already kinda bad that they're living among humans...cute, but they're wild animals, and the #1 and #2 killers of bobcats are cars and rat poison.    Pinecones or something similar seems like a better idea.
All kitties are kitties regardless of size.   The difference between a tabby and a tiger is that one can actually eat you.
Lick  Lick  Lick  Lick  Li-- wh--  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
I never knew they sounded like that!
Haha I had no idea. The house was vacant a good amount of time before I bought it so the owners may never have even noticed. I wouldn't have known if it wasn't for the kittens last year playing in my backyard a couple times.
Tucson, AZ
r/likeus
Really? It was right there.  Right meow!
All moms have this problem.  “Can I just get two minutes to get clean?!  FUCK!  .... Git back here!!!!” said every mom ever.
Yeah I have a ton of videos, and I'll probably end up giving updates as they grow.
Let’s do a GoFundMe for the ball.
We have had bobcats giving birth in our old barn for years and years now. Cute little kittens and it keeps the mice at bay!
Amen! Let the wild animals stay wild!
They live on a roof of a house, I think that's about as much man made interference as possible outside of filming them.  #ballforbobcats
They're not native to roofs, they're an invasive species. Which means it's okay for the bobcats to hunt them.
TBF the Ozarks have enough on their hands right now.
The mom actually leaves for most of the day and provides their hydration through her milk I think.
That would’ve sold me right there.  I’ll take it!
He probably diden't talk to the previous owner, the bank sold him the house after the previous owner was eaten by bobcats. :)
unless done with very thick gloves, there is no way you're picking up the kitten without getting scratched by it
That's certainly true when it comes to cardboard boxes:   https://i.imgur.com/JmdaoJe.gifv
REASON LAST OWNERS LEFT: ~~Eaten by bobcats~~ looking to downgrade to a smaller place to save on property taxes
"I came back from work down south and some birds were already nesting in the box by the back door. She was fairly alarmed when I showed up. I had to stick my head out like a bird for a few days before she calmed down. She was like ""what are you doing here?"" And I was like ""I was already living here and besides I would never hurt you"""

BUILD THAT BALL!
☺️ this makes me happy. Not just because cats, because we need heathy predator populations to maintain healthy ecosystems. But also cats.
That video would be intense
Yea, that is why I was thinking only the mom really needed water at this point. They can get most of their water content from food being cats, but a little extra never hurt. Once they start hunting on their own they might also need water in times of little food, or only finding food with low moisture.  No need to put any out if you know of some accessible water sources near by they can visit. But all animals can use more water sources.
"I've band aids & scratches from the ""regular"" kittens I foster. They aren't even trying to hurt me.So yeah."
The lion at the end has completely flattened out their box. Haha.
I heard they charge you per Bobcat in some states. Luckily in Canada they just charge you the square metres of moose which luckily isn't too much because Moose are big it'll cost you 2 maybe 2.5 tops.
Then she was like “too bad I cant speak English since I’m a bird.” And you were probably like “if I had only spent less time on reddit and more time tweeting, maybe we could come to an understanding.” Then she may have been like, “your eyeballs look like food, I’d try to pluck them if I wasn’t busy puking into all these mouths.”
My roof just happens to have this little cove thing that the mom decided was a good safe place since Bobcats like being high. So it's not super common.
Mostly it’s gnarled old cougars roaming around the streets of Tucson, but there’s some Bobcats too apparently.
Set up a 24/7 live stream.

and make the bobcats pay for it.
You know what else is intense? Circus sex.  Wait. No. I think I fucked up the joke.
Jason Bateman is causing an absolute shit show of problems over there.
I wouldn’t provide water. This mama decided to have her kittens here because it’s suitable habitat. That means there must already be water nearby. Making your property into some kind of magnetic oasis for wild animals isn’t always a good thing. clearly this spot works for their den just the way it is... don’t F with the natural process it’s perfect the way it is!
Basically a dog software, cat hardware.
I lost like 18 months of my life to Big Cat Rescue’s YouTube channels. they’re the ones that posted the content of the cougars in boxes— that’s Orion and Ares, they’ve been at the sanctuary since a hunter killed their mom and tried to steal them and their sister, and the guy’s brother turned him in...  Orion usually meows and it’s absolutely adorable. I think it’s in this vid https://youtu.be/BXhfZRE08ko
A moose bit my sister once...

brb bout to go be a bobcat
I'm at work rn wishing I was a bobcat.  Update: I made it. I am now a bobcat.
Your time will come. Hang in there comrade
calling it now, this is gonna be a new reddit meme/reference thing soon.
I used to be a bobcat but can't anymore due to self control
[Their relationship in one picture](https://imgur.com/a/VbVqcOS)  She's not even mad here. That's just her face. I got her from the pound when she was a few years old. I have had her 11 years and through a million moved and boyfriends and now she gets to be with me as I live a sedate life as a mom/wife. Don't overlook adult cats! She is the best impulse buy of my life. Photos are mine taken by @caseyraephoto on insta
This picture makes me happy.
Precious, what they talking bout?
sometimes we get in trouble just because we're very small,  we maybe leave our pawprints on the floor or on the wall  or maybe spill our food out of our dish upon the floor  or when we get a treat it's not enough, n we want more  if you ever feel like you have tried to do the best you could,  but realize it's not quite right, cuz it's hard to be good -  jes know there's always me here, fren - life sometimes is a test  you're perfect in my eyes, my boy, n i love you the best   
Today my son pretended that the cat scratched him to see it get in trouble.
Kalvin and Hobz 
I've said it before on reddit.  Cats don't just want to go outside. They want to go outside WITH YOU. They want to explore with you and play in the grass with you and nap in the sun with you. When I figured that out I started taking a blanket into the front yard and my cat and I would lay out there while I played with my laptop and he scratched at the trees.  Looks like Op's son has figured that out.
This kind of blew up! I own the rights to the photo but credit must be given to our family photographer. She gets the most beautiful pics of my kid and pets. @caseyraephoto on instagram 
Reminds me of my childhood cat. I put a cabbage patch kids dress on her and my nana made me a matching one.  We dressed up like twins for my cats birthday.  I love cats.
This is a beautiful picture
I don’t get how your cat doesn’t run away. My cat got out and was missing for a week. How do I train cats to stay by me or be able to be indoor or outdoor?
I’ve heard Calicos are sweet. I thought it was a saying, but each calico I have met is loving and affectionate. 
My boy was a rescue cat. I think he tolerated me because he trusted me, but wasn’t ever really affectionate. That was until my little girl was born; he had finally found his human.   He was 8kgs of part feral beast, unfriendly to almost everyone, and barely tolerating those of us he liked, but his girl; he adored.   I would often find her sitting on him and “reading”. She would pull his whiskers and when she released them, he would bunt her from head to tail, miaow as if to say “are you coming?” and wait for her to crawl after him. He slept under her bed, cot, and next to her capsule. He would wait by the door when we left and miaow at me until he could smell her when we came home, making sure she was safe.   He adored her. Rescue cats are the best.

[> She's not even mad here. That's just her face. ](https://i.imgur.com/s3hpJHH.png) 
My 12 yr old is the sweetest cat on the planet with most people, kids, and dogs. The moment she sees another cat all hell breaks loose and she beats them up. 
When our kids were born, lots of helpful people informed us we couldn’t have a cat with kids, the usual crap, won’t bore you with it.  We swallowed hard, but decided to wait and see how it went.  Our old crock of a cat, it turned out, would hop into a crib and wave her precious untouchable tail in front of a yowling baby, evidently to get him to stop the racket.  When they were old enough to shade her and bug her, she’d put up with it until she had enough and then smack them, hard, with a paw.  No claws.  God, she was a great old girl...
[She looks like my aunt's cat Mia!](https://imgur.com/a/1rWNnt0)
That grumpy face!!! 😻😻😻😻😻
Reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes lol, I think that's why I like it and a time when you were a kid and had no worries.  Ah man everytime I look at it, it makes my heart hurt. Tears of happiness.
I like the picture 
Taking over the world
😭😭😭😭😭
fuck I've had an emotional day and now I'm crying
Thank you for sharing your poetry with us! I always look for your stuff in comments. Your work is so sweet and wholesome!
I lol'd. that is some sibling level shit
My cat growing up used to punch me in the face (literally, no claws) routinely for breathing the wrong way. 
My last outdoor cat loved and owned the neighborhood.  He would greet all the little kids when they got off the elementary school bus and accept the pets and hugs and scritches.    If we went for a walk, he went with us.  He was wonderful and awesome and I miss him.  Someone let him out on New Year's Eve and he took off like a bat out of hell.  Missing for 3 years now.  
She's an indoor cat, we took her out for photos. He took hanging on to her leash and keeping her safe very seriously. She's also old as fuck and doesn't run anywhere anymore
In my experience, you just...let them go outside. After an adjustment period of like 2 weeks or so, that is. As long as you’ve been feeding them and treating them well, they’ll come back. They know where their bread is buttered.   Caveat: indoor/outdoor cats tend to have a shorter life span, on account of disease, predators, and cars. They also murder constantly. If you’re okay with that, have at it. Just make sure you’ve disabled the cat’s reproductive equipment, and don’t declaw it if you want it to have a chance to survive out there.
This is a tortie actually. Calicos are mostly white with small sections of orange and black. Torties are black with orange/yellow scattered throughout.   Torties are described as ‘almond joys’, sweet on the outside but a little nutty inside. I’ve worked with close to 30,000 cats and have to say probably 99% of torties fit that bill. Very sweet with pretty big crazy streaks.
Torties are notorious for their resting bitch face. I think it’s just the markings? Every tortie I’ve met is super nice, just mean-looking. My friend’s tortie looks like she has permanent angry eyebrows, but is a love bug. 
My girl HATES other cats. She has had 2 rabbit brothers and 2 dog sisters in her tenure here and gets along great with every living being who is not a cat. 
Since I am attention whoring my cat: here is her first pro photo shoot with her boy and the picture of her finding out she was getting a new human [Izzy faces ](https://imgur.com/gallery/KNPitbl) 
Looks like a film adaptation in the vein of Christopher Robin.
Wow,heavy stuff for lil meow meow and lil dude.
The same thing they talk about every night...
Hey! I hope you're doing okay there. hang in there!
They're a rich white people thing. They come with the starterpack.
I have a few things in common with your cat. 
Yep. She fits every tortie stereotype. 
 https://i.imgur.com/jUP5wc4.jpg Meet Bean
Thank you! I have a tortie rescue. Her resting bitch face game is top notch as is her ability to simultaneously pretend to hate snuggles while also cuddling in. I don't even know how to explain these abilities they just are. The absolute best are those moments when she completely snuggles in with a smug little smile on her face, though.
[I don't know. This is a good one too.](https://i.imgur.com/R390EId_d.jpg)
If the cat feels uncomfortable 9/10 the cat will fight you
It's because cats are the masters. With any other animals they are chill since they know they own them, no matter the size. But another cat is a challenge: there cannot be two masters in the house, only one shall order the human and the other feeble-minded beings.  Your regal girl would probably slay if she was a Game of Throne character
That cat always stares down the camera person?
"""meow""  ""Agreed. We strike them when they least suspect it. Nap time"""
Which one is the genius? 
Are you often cared for by a toddler?
"In my experience, it's not the breed, but it's the derp level.  All my cats have been sweet in a condescending, ""Oh you poor human.  You couldn't possibly survive without me."" way.  However, the sweetest cat I've had is my current boy orange tabby who is dumber than a pile of bricks.  I'll catch that cat just sitting out, looking at the window, purring.  When I go to bed, he runs up to my head, and plop down on my face purring loud enough to wake neighbors.  On the other hand, when he had to go on a special diet isolated from the other cats, it took him 4 weeks to figure out his new eating place.  Other cats have taken 1 or 2 *meals*.  He's also incredibly fearless (probably too dumb).  Runs up to new people meowing at them and purring, jumps up on top of doors, etc."

Here's my girl [Phoenix](https://i.imgur.com/1HtXpvT.jpg) judging you.  And then [a moment later](https://i.imgur.com/uym9JhN.jpg) looking cute as hell. 
My tortie is super chill and happens to be the only one I've seen without resting butch face. She so just follows people around chirping at them till they talk back to her and she'll respond back and forth as if having a conversation. Maybe it's because she was hand raised by us, I'm not sure.   Edit: someone asked for pics so heres two, one of her asleep and another of her burying herself into a pile of my clothes. https://imgur.com/a/P4dAzj8

A lot of animals perceive lenses as REALLY BIG EYES and so they do their best to figure out what's going on there.

Those people never had a dog. Dogs get happy as fuck. And they do smile when they're happy. Just like they get that look when they're about to be naughty or just were naughty. They show emotions with faces.
Say hello to man’s best friend. 
100%. They learn from our behavior too. I really believe that. When they do something and see us smile they want to mimick that to share in that with us in return. My dog is smart as hell, and by now we have full on conversations through facial expressions that he's picked up on and mimicks. Dogs are the fuckin best. 
Sorry, bro... Kinda sucks that this is how you find out your dog is cheating on you.
She is my SO and yes she knows about the cameras.  Edit - My house is smart and only accessible trough a VPN. She have access to the cameras too. I was not spying; I got an alert because it was after midnight and security was armed.  Edit 2 - We foster dogs from the local humane society from time to time and we like to make sure Nina our dog (the one in video) is getting along we the foster dog while we are at work. We also have an  electronic doggy door so we need to be able to see if the dogs are in or out. (We have a fenced yard and dogs can go in and out as they please)  Edit 3 - Nina wanted to say hi to everyone. https://i.imgur.com/gS3Tj99.jpg

Just as I suspected, she's dancing with other men

you all know what to do, let’s pick apart OPs kitchen.
nope, a girl broke in and started dancing with his dog
They don’t seem to be missing you at all.
My dog would never do this :(
Dogs only want one thing
hey, dads away, so now's our chance  c'mon, my friend - you wanna dance?  you teachin me them killer steps -  (Hey! maybe i can teach you 'bleps'!)  when dad gets home he'll be surprise  he Just will not believe his eyes -   the next time when your dance begin  i'll say to him - '*can I cut in'?!*
The fact that you got an alert and turned it on to see this is fucking adorable.
>I got an alert because it was after midnight and security was armed  this sentence makes the video so much better
I.e. Dear internet:  chill the fuck out and just enjoy this video of a nice lady dancing with a dog.
I can’t ever post a pic or video admiring my gf, or her with our dogs, etc. whenever I do it’s always filled with people jumping down my throat “dOeS sHe KnOw YoUrE PoStInG ThIS!?” Like yeah dude she’s looking directly at the camera
Imagine you see this and you have neither dog nor girl.
Aww.. we call one of our boys that cause he crawls into bed to snuggle every morning as soon as my husband gets up.
I'm glad I'm not alone 😂
Wine + cleaning supplies = dancing with the dog.
And the other guy is a better dancer, to boot :(  OP never had a chance :(
I hope there is no bone-sharing going on.
can't wait to have a girl or a home
We* love her.

Wouldn't we all?
You poor fool... 😞
All dogs are dogs.
And it’s DISGUSTING!
I totally just imagined you flinging treats and distracting robbers with lasers.
We just have cheap cameras up that we use for security, as well as use as baby/pet cams. We recently were able to use the set-up to figure out *which one* of our cats threw up so we could get them medical attention - something that has been super frustrating in the past! It's just never been a problem for us, trust-wise, to have cameras around.
I know, right?  People who don't trust their SOs don't understand.  Husband and I both have Life360 on our phones, and cameras at home.  It's for protection.  We live in a city on the West Coast which is becoming increasingly unsafe.  Neither one of us cares at all if the other periodically opens the app or checks cameras to wonder what the other is doing, idly.  Neither one of us are sneaky or nefarious individuals, so neither one of us cares if the other has instant access to the others' whereabouts or activities.  If hubby opens cameras and sees me bent over scratching my ass, oh well, he's been married to me for well over a decade now.  XD     To be honest, we don't look that often ... I'll check Life360 at the end of the day sometimes or something to see if husband is on the move home from work yet, but yeah, it's totally fine.
Imagine you see this, and when you get home, you're out of peanut butter.
Dude. Jar.

1. Always be overjoyed to see her; run in for kisses and hugs 2. Keep your eyes and attention primarily on her. Stay attuned to your girl's emotional state, and learn to read her well (dogs are phenomenal at this) 3. Love touching and asking her to touch you in a non-sexual, affectionate manner ('pet') 4. Make it obvious that you love her, and want her to be happy
1. be a dog 2. don't not be a dog
Play dumb, smile a lot, give attention and tell her she’s pretty.
K9s are such dogs...

Yes, but better. Because porn is porn and cats are cats
My ex was really self conscious about her body because she had had small breasts but I find petite girls with smallish breasts hot. I tried to prove how much I love her body by showing her the fact that my favorite pornstar has the exact same body type as her.   I honestly don’t know what was going through my mind but being drunk probably didn’t help. 
goddammit reddit. 
A cat is fine too.
I can’t believe you’ve done this
Please get this dog a beep ball used for blind baseball players!!!!  He’s adorable
Holy shit, the resolution on this video
Blindness aint gonna stop him from having fun
I got as excited as he did when he found the ball
Im not having a great christmas, this really made me smile. Thank your sister for being awesome.
Damn, that dog is pretty. 
You should post on r/greyhounds ! 
Adorable. Does he have a [bumper halo?](https://muffinshalo.com) 
My blind dog loved fetch too. It was always fun y when people would pull the fake throw crap on him, and he wouldn't fall for it.
"Lol that butt pat at the end   ""WHO DID THAT"" "
Thanks for the recommendation! He’s not allowed to chew much on toys due to teeth issues but I’ll check it out!   Edit: just want to say hello r/all and thanks for the gold yall!!   This is T! He’s a 4 year old Greyhound. My sister rescued him 2 years ago and at the time we didn’t know he was blind. The rods and cones of his eyes are dissolving - basically just eye deterioration. Not a problem for him because he can find a couch or bed or rug no matter where he is! Just weird for us because his eyes reflection creepily haha   The equipment in the background is set up for an agility class at a local training center. Check out what’s local to you if you think your dog would have some fun on the obstacles!   Lastly, please check out your local Greyhound rescue. These are amazing dogs who I honestly recommend first anytime someone asks about what kind of dog they should look for. Also look at transportation networks for these guys and see if you can volunteer!   Update: she’s reactivated her Instagram @sightless_sighthound
Where can I find this? Does it have a specific name or brand?  - Owner of a Blind Border Collie who loves fetch! 
Get on YouTube and look up 4K 60fps videos. You won’t be disappointed
My New Year’s resolution has nothing on this.
Ain't no one gona stop him nowww
Piggy backing off the top comment to say: absolutely! He fortunately doesn’t need sight for his favorite activity: sleeping. Not even his second favorite activity: cuddling!   Just want to say thanks for the kind comments!!   As for the most common questions:   He’s a greyhound! They’re fantastic dogs and I encourage everyone to check out rescues!   this was recorded on an iPhone but the setting changed to 1080 by 60.   And after talking to my sister about a ball with a bell, I’ve been informed he has cat toys that do have bells. Unfortunately that cuts into his very important nap time ....   Update: she’s reactivated her Instagram @sightless_sighthound
A fun version of this game would be to have a toy that makes some sort of noise as it moves. That way the pupper could track it even from a decent distance. 
If you ever need cute puppy pictures to help you out, just send me a message!
A brindle greyhound! It’s an incredibly beautiful breed. They’re known as the world’s fastest couch potatoes! 
Also /r/Longboyes 
Unfortunately his nose is too long for a bumper :( she was really stoked to get one and was pretty upset when it didn’t work 
He’s a greyhound! He’s seriously awesome, fantastic dogs - I highly recommend them! 
I know the balls they use are softer in the case they hit a player. But either way, thanks for sharing such a joyful puppy dog!
Beep balls and some way to mark the balls he has with an oil scent could be useful... 
That shit looks clearer than real life
dont stop him nowww!
Cause he’s having such a good taiiiiimmee, HE’S FETCHING A BAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!
My dog went blind last March. She always loved her squeaky balls (Santa just brought her more) so we have a modified game of catch. I take her out to the driveway, which is a good amount of space where she can run around knowing she won't bump into anything, and I run in circles squeaking the ball and she actually runs at a good clip after me, following the sound. Then I stop and roll the ball towards her and she puts her front paws out and waits for it. Most of the time I intentionally miss, bouncing it off her so she can sense which direction it went and sniff it out like a bloodhound. She loves the hunt of the ball and it builds her confidence.  When it comes time to play ball I squeak it inside the house and she squeals and squeals with happiness and heads for the door just like when she could see.  I also bought her one of those doggie strollers so I can take her for walks and get her out of the house. I take her out of the stroller along the way and she can still walk a little bit here and there, sniffing everything in sight. Then we stroll around and she barks like mad at the other dogs who bark at her which basically seems to give her life.  When I drive to our usual walking places she recognizes where we're going according to direction and gets excited. She even stands up and puts her head out the window, which she actually rarely ever did when she could still see. The first time I saw her do that, post-blindness, I could have died with joy.  Good luck with your doggie. I know it's really sad, and sometimes I have a good cry about it. Somehow we muddle through and have our good days and bad. Maybe yours won't lose all of her sight. My dog lost hers very rapidly but still had about 20% in one eye for the final three days and was still able to get by quite well at that point with only that little vision. Also, if yours is losing her sight at a slower rate maybe she'll be able to adapt more easily.  P.S. Sorry for the lengthy tl;dr! I think I'm wired for Christmas or something.  Edit: Thanks ever so much to the kind stranger who gave me my first gold on this Christmas day! : )    :  )     :  )
Great idea! Now we need someone to design it, produce it, and sell it and then we’ll have even better blind dog videos next year!
Thanks kind of a drug expert! Ill message you if I need advice on anti-depressants too. haha
Sounds like it needs to be modified. Unfortunately things are built kinda one size fits most. I have a weenie, and it’s hard to find jackets to fit him. 
This made for a really merry Christmas eve. Cheers, OP.
an animal fat or cooking oil may be fine, but do not use essential oils on dog toys.
Yeah man I heard the graphics outside are unreal
 his having such a good time
We are likely far apart but know that there are many of us out here that care about those in pain wherever/whoever you are.  
Sir please keep the conversation SFW 
According to many in the stands, the refs are certainly blind.  EDIT: umpires. Thanks for the correction.
"They definitely make toys with pockets to put a nice smelly treat in. This pupper looks like he doesn't mind when the ball ""escapes,"" but one of those kong things could be great too. They've got a compartment and don't roll around as much. "
r/outside
He's finding the ball
Needs some debugging patches, that's for sure.
If you wanna have a good time, just give him a call!
Unfortunately it's pay to win.

We all saw the behind the scenes video bro... let the doggo eat :)
How did he get into the ball game? Did the gate attendants think he was a good little boy? 
Pretty sure that's cannibalism.

Doesn't look like this is taken then, though. Look at the fence behind him. Good boye seems to be good often
True story: I was in New York on holiday with my wife and needed crutches as she’d hurt her ankle. Our holiday was in danger of being ruined, but that’s when I decided to turn to the good folk of /r/NYC.  I put up a post asking if anyone had a pair of crutches they could lend us for a week - within an hour, up popped a private message: ‘Can you meet me by 125th St Station?’   Absolutely.   Now, it’s a crazy thing to head off and meet a stranger in NYC but man, we were desperate after pushing a wheelchair around the Met the previous day. As we headed up north, the rain started hosing down. It was torrential by the time we got out of the station, standing under an overpass looking down on Manhattan a short while away. Would this guy show? Would he have crutches? We didn’t know.   Then, out of the downpour, a figure appears - like a rock breaking through a waterfall, a man in his 40’s dashes, clutching a pair of crutches. He’s soaked, but only too happy to help. We exchange pleasantries, and he’s on his way with a handshake. My wife and I look at each other - we’ve got a pair of crutches; she’s gonna be able to move around freely again.   Let me tell you, those crutches saved our holiday. My wife’s ankle got better, and we were able to enjoy our first trip to he Big Apple - all thanks to the amazing generosity of a random Redditor who was willing to dash through the rain to help a couple of desperate Kiwis in the big city. We returned those crutches with thanks, a voucher or two, and some Reddit Gold.  Here’s to you, my man. It’s not just a small world.   It’s a big-hearted Reddit community.
Happy cake day! Hope you get a hot dog w a candle

Everyone once in a while they do a promotion where you are allowed to take dogs into the stadium during a game.
It might be a Bark in the Park night, where you can bring your dog :)
No, only for dachshunds. 
I found him on the front page 
Yᴇᴀʜ! I'ᴍ ʀᴇᴀʟʟʏ ᴇxᴄɪᴛᴇᴅ ᴀʙᴏᴜᴛ ᴛʜɪs ᴛᴏᴏ
Where's the grill below the railing behind the dog? This is not the same location 
I am now growing concerned about how many hot dogs this guy fed to his dog
I love hearing about redditors helping each other. Makes me feel good about people.
The [Washington Nationals](https://www.mlb.com/nationals/tickets/promotions/themes/ladies-night) have that promotion. Took mine last time I was in town. She had a great time!
"A man walks into a NY bar with his dachshund and asks if he can have a free beer if he can demonstrate that the dog can talk.  ""Sure"" said the bartender ""What can he say?"" The man asks the dachshund, "" What is on top of the house?"" ""Roof, Roof!"" replied the dachshund. ""You gotta do better than that!"" said the bartender. ""OK"" said the man turning to his dog, "" What does the surface of sandpaper feel like?"" ""Ruff, Ruff"" was the canine reply. ""I'll give you one more chance before you and your dog have to leave"" said the bartender. ""Ok"" said the thirsty man, ""Alright, think hard now, who was the greatest NY Yankee ever?"" ""Ruth, Ruth!"" the dog replied.  The bartender was not impressed and asked them both to leave. Turning to go, the dachshund asked ""Should I have said Dimaggio?"""
Posted gif, can confirm, also excited. 
Different location, same photoshoot, equally adorable. We're allowing it.
It's a treat when they go to ball games, jeez 
I helped some Canadian redditors that were in my city for a festival test their drugs one year. Does that count for a feel good story too?
You took your dog to ladies night or are you implying the lady you took to it was a total bitch 
Oh yeah you’re right, background is different. But the scarf is the same so it’s definitely the same dog. Shhh I want to believe   edit: I’ve figured out the mystery. It’s the same spot, just further up the steps 
Watched gif, am also excited. 
Well a bite of hot dog is a treat, 2 full hot dogs on buns loaded with condiments would be a bit excessive.  But I was mostly joking and I don't have any reason to think that this guy actually let his dog eat 2 full hot dogs
Link: https://imgur.com/gallery/9Cnme3Vc
2 full hot dogs that could potentially be months apart? That’s not exactly excessive 😂  
Yeah I’d guess they just took the photo more than one place. Same scarf, hat and everything. The guy prob realized he wanted a background where you could see the stadium so took more, and doggo was happy to drool on another hot dog
Gif not work, excitement waning        edit: [gif](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9djyde/good_boy_doing_his_best_to_pose_with_food_at_the/)
Hey there. This is my dog, his name is Dash.  I took the photo (I’m the guy sitting on the steps in the video). They were both taken the same night (Wednesday 9/05) but at slightly different locations in the stands. The stadium lights from the location in the video didn’t make for particularly great photos, even after I edited them. So I got another hot dog afterwards and moved to a slightly lower location, which is why the railing/grating seen in the video doesn’t appear in the photo. During the second photo shoot, Dash knocked my beer over.   There were 2 hot dogs involved, neither one had relish... only ketchup & mustard. Yes, he got to eat 2 hot dogs... it was a special occasion, and he’s a very good boy.  
No, that would be cruel. Why wouldn't you feed the dog for two months?
because of the earlier fatshaming
God I wish that were me 
My dog always goes to the Airbnb house on our property first thing in the morning with a ball. 🤣  Edit: thank you for the gold!! If anyone deserves gold it’s Oakley.. She brings joy to everyone she meets. For this gold I shall give her a treat. ❤️🐶
Those are some seriously underhanded methods to achieve good reviews. Bribery!
One man's 5 star review is another man's allergic reaction. 
I don’t understand how the hosts would trust their pets with perfect strangers?! I’m too protective of my pets...
This happened to me at an AirBnB a few years ago.   [I woke up seeing this.](https://imgur.com/dCz8Ltx)       
Hi everyone! We are the ones with the air bnb! For those mentioning allergies, it is mentioned when you view our house about the cats (we have 3) so if you are allergic or don't like cats for some reason, you don't have to book with us! We also make sure to mention to anyone who stays here before hand that we have cats just incase they missed it in the listing! :) you also have the option of letting us know if you're okay with having the cats out or we will kindly put them away in our room for your stay! Also for those wondering how we trust our guests, we live in the home as well! When you book with us, you have to have verification so if something happens, air bnb covers our backs! But we trusts our guests :) I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay u/Tan-zania! And we know Oliver is looking forward to your stay here again! ♡
r/catswithjobs
Stayed in an AirBNB once with two cats, they were so cute and friendly and cuddled with us when we were sleeping, etc.   When we we packing up to leave on the last day I realized that one of the cats had peed in my suitcase.
Aw! I love AirBnB cats!
Staying at an airbnb and you don't lock your room while sleeping? That's brave 
That is a superior hospitality professional.
The cat or the guy?
I mean, I get that OP is handsome, but you can’t just go around licking people’s faces like that!
It can be for $89 a night, book now!
I would pay extra to play fetch with your dog.
I have a pack of 7 and they like to hover near the door of our AirBnB rental when we have new guests to see if they can get some pets and treats. I let my guests know I have several dogs before hand but they always seem a bit surprised by all of them.
Cat is the mastermind behind it.
This! I assume the hosts must’ve warned him though.
I always think this when I see these kinds of posts. I would love to be woken up to a kitten next to me but in reality i'd have gotten the itchy eyes and sneezes and not been able to sleep all night.
I recently spoke with a friend who said that they leave their cat in the apartment when they AirBnB it. I can’t imagine ever feeling comfortable enough to do that. I’d be so worried that the person would just absentmindedly let him out or something. Also, the cat would probably scratch them and then vomit in their shoe, so that wouldn’t be too great either.
I was talking to the owners this morning, supposedly they dont usually allow the cats in that room but he must have snuck under the bed when I left the door open last night. Still a pleasant surprise
Airbnb host here!   I have one cat and when we first started doing Airbnb I was super nervous about strangers interacting with my cat. Like them leaving the door open and letting her run out or other possible fears. But we are almost 1 year into this and everyone has left positive reviews about our cat and how they enjoy having an animal around during their stay.
You guys are lucky. I rented a room on Airbnb a few years ago and they neglected to mention they had a huge pet snake...
I'm glad you guys saw this! Thanks for the great stay, everything was awesome. (First booked person too)
“You did request a morning tongue bath?”
"""Don't leave! You are mine!"""
To be fair they could have the whole house/apartment to themselves. 
Yes.
For me I want to be the guy... that cat reminds me of my favorite cat ever that passed away (she was a lot more black to she was also black and white and had the same face). I miss that kitty and I'd totally take snuggles from that cat (problem is I'd also be tempted to smuggle the cat away ;) ).
Funny enough, that seems to be exactly what the point of this thread is.I spent a few minutes researching (okay....stalking) the OP, the AirBnB in question, and the convenient appearance of the AirBnB host spamming their links.  >**Seems almost like the OP might actually be the husband and/or involved in setting up this thread to promote their AirBnB on reddit?** AirBnB host has a brand new reddit account (and weeks-old AirBnB account with no reviews) and somehow found this thread within 2 hours of it being made, then started sharing their links to an AirBnB. Also has only one prior review as a VISITOR (not host), strangely from someone renting rooms in their own city (Dayton)....so they rented a room in someone else's house in Dayton while themselves renting out rooms in their house in Dayton all within a few weeks of each other? *Seems extremely odd*   >   >Screenshots: [https://imgur.com/a/SFHhMnA](https://imgur.com/a/SFHhMnA)   >   >edit: [OP now spamming the host's link too.](https://imgur.com/a/bx6xl3k)   >   >edit2: [THEY ADMITTED THEY KNOW EACH OTHER](https://imgur.com/a/anYtkMV) once I called them out
She approves your message and is eagerly waiting. https://i.imgur.com/mX7ZHN8.jpg 
You are living my dream. I cannot wait for more dogs. The only downside to our situation is if there are no balls around my dog will bring our guests rocks. Which is destroying her teeth. So we bought the Costco size boxes of tennis balls to keep in the guest house and have it written in the rules to not throw rocks.
The more reviews he gets the more catnip he's given
Well I think we can assume that this cat is well socialized with humans so it wouldn’t have anxiety like that. Hopefully most owners know their animals enough to know how well they get along with non-familiar humans. 
I'd be worried the guest would be some kind of psychopath who'd hurt my cat.
Were the owners still at the property? I kind of assumed you were only renting a room in the house.
I can easily see it mistake a testicle for an egg at some point
r/wholesome
That would be $50 please
but why?
Hahahaha he said yes when there were 2 options omg so funny lmao

Not like I don't trust my cats, I don't trust people
Watering the cat sounds like they have to pour water on it every morning so it grows up nice and strong
there are lots of airbnbs where you just rent a room in a shared space  The reason to do it is they’re very cheap
yeah man
Attractive cat and/or person  Edit: yeah it could definitely be an attractive cat person as well. 
I truly do... We just had our 4th and last kid.So I’m hoping in a few years I “accidentally” acquire another pupper.. my husband will kill me since we have 2 dogs, 2 cats, a few fish tanks, and a tortoise. 😇   This is her a few minutes ago...

Are you my fiance? We have 2 dogs 3 cats 2 fish a snake a gecko and a uromastyx. Shes a dog groomer and everyone always pushes foster animals onto us ;;
Doing gods work. Thank you for being a master creeper.
Logical me knows this dog is full of drool and earth-ending farts but emotional me doesn't care and wants to be best friends. 
But what is he moderating?
Lol... maybe??? So how do I go about bringing home a random animal without my husband getting mad? Pretend I dont notice it? Like, “oh Lordy! How did that Llama get in our front yard? Welp! I guess she chose us so we have to keep her”  I love your wife’s job. Animals are the best. My kids know I love the dog more than them. One day. When the kids are older, I’ll replace their pictures with my animals. See if they notice.
I did! Should have included that, I was living in an apt complex at the time and he'd gone up to the third floor and was meowing at that person's door.
It.
Well that clears things up 
they dont think it be like it is
Love the respect
We've all been that guy at the end, when you've worked so hard on a project and when you finally finish, you just need to chill.
Do you really have to fuck up the planter?
I like how after all that, he just wants to sit down
That’s one gnarly trick
He can quite scootering now I hope.
[Source](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1raJ_mBE6v/?igshid=kpjyylgt6vz2)
Grounds keepers HATE him! Watch this one cool trick to find out why
Ya mean dedication?
I expected him to celebrate after completing it.
And watch the sunrise on a grateful universe.
It looks like they did a good job fixing things up after the wipeouts.
This is why every community needs a skate park and why every community hates skaters.  These rails literally exist to keep people out of the planters.  Respect to the kid for not giving up, but same respect taken away because he semi destroyed that planter.  And now some poor guy that makes minimum wage has to go spend another afternoon fixing it all up.
When you reach the end of your journey and realise it was pointless.
All that effort, and still a trick on a scooter. Damn.
Probably means from the spectators
I've been there (skating not scootering).   Sometimes you've spent everything you got because you had to land it. Like, you're almost over it at that point.
Beat me to it
Even if the plants die, they’re relatively inexpensive to fix.  The railing he’s shredding is going to be permanently fucked though.
we've come full circle...
respectators
Me last night. I've been skating since last June and I've finally got my ollies consistent enough to hop onto shit. I spent 20 minutes last night trying to ollie a 6 inch curb. Nailed it twice in a row and immediately went home. I don't have the energy for celebration but trust me when I say I didn't need it. The sense of... pride and accomplishment 😏... was palpable
Nah just remove the rail, heat it up to bend it straight, chuck it in a lathe and take a light skin cut, galvanize it in molten zinc, rebend it, and mount it.  *permanently fucked* lmao get real.
Awwdience
Cost of repairs: twice as much as the original rail
Lmao who’s man is this
Applaudience
A prowd
A clapping of admirers
I was told there would be woosh
Let me just grab my 20 mats and foam pit out of my mat and foam pit room real quick.
i m going to try this at home and going to get broken neck
This feel a bit r/restofthefuckingowl to me.
although I will most likely never do this I found this tutorial extremely helpful
I love how he's showing how not to do it, but still manages to land on his feet just fine
Cool. Can I use it when you’re done?? I found a video online that I can learn how to do a back tuck but all I need to do is be ok rolling off a mat for a few feet and not landing on my head.
Videotape it so we can watch it on either /r/HadToHurt or /r/HoldMyFeedingTube
Also definitely not r/toptalent. Is there a r/mildlytalent?
What shape is your soup sandwich of a body in that you can't roll backwards onto your feet?  Eat a fucking salad my man.
"I wouldn't say landing a backflip is considered ""mildly talented"" as a good majority of people will never be able to do one."
Haha wtf is a soup sandwich??
And (not that I know anything) but it seems like his technique is REALLY good.  It’s one thing to do a backflip - it’s another thing to do what seems like a perfect backflip

I could feel the joy in this all the way down to my toes
The real top talent here? He does this with the biggest fucking smile on his face... so amazing.
NO LIE Not enough!!!!!!!
Just had an eargasm after listening to it
It sounds like smiles
Dude looked so happy, seriously put me in such a good mood!
Yea I upvoted in spite of the shitty title
Agreed! More is needed!
Why did he stop???
I played this in my work meeting and everyone had crippling 36 second long orgasms that enveloped their entire body. Tommy couldn’t handle it. He’s loading up in the ambulance as I type this. My boss cancelled work and is retiring to the mountains to meditate for the rest of his life because of this. Jim has started a religion to worship a dual spirit god that is half African American, half violin. Jane still hasn’t stopped orgasming.

He's aware of the effect he has on ears.
Okay. What the fuck
Stop interrupting the music with your notifications. I’m about to transcend this reality and enter the next stage in the evolution of humanity.
Lets wait for those insecure people who start to overjudge the kid just so they feel better about themselves
Jesus Christ... all these fake internet street fighters commenting on this kids workout.
His boxing skills are great and all, but do y'all see that outfit? Where can I get me one of those?
Great work for sure but he's essentially passing it to himself so it's less reflexes and more prediction
Sped up but still a very skilled kid nonetheless.
I would have knocked myself out on that thing fasten than I could say guacamole.
No doubt it's better than nothing and I'm not tryna shit on the work this kid is putting in but reflexes don't have much to do with knowing when that pad is gonna swing around at the same speed and location every single time.
Ok I'm here. What do I have to do?
See, 'cause its NOT COOL that a kid MAKES them FEEL WEAK.
This kid can still dodge a punch fast as hell, reflexes aside
I don't get why people feel the need to speed up cool videos like this. It would have been just as awesome regardless.
It looks cool in a gif though. That's what counts around here!
Umm okay. Start by criticizing the parents for not letting him be a kid.
It’s more movement training than anything I’d say. Like it’s really hard to teach fast movement, but having something also fast swinging around for comparison is actually amazing for that.
Bruh this kid got no comboes
Rhythm too
He’s essential doing the same move over and over again. Back in my day, we did a bunch of different moves and stuff
Yes. Yes. Let the hate flow through you.
For those that need context about the guys behind him here you go.The other guys running with him are his pacers, people that were  running around him so he’ll know how quickly he needs to run as running a constant speed throughout a long distance is the best way to do it. They also help reduce the amount of air resistance Kipchoge will have to deal with improving the timing.There were many pacers that kept switching to help Kipchoge but in the end they let him run on his own to enjoy the moment.
He looks surprisingly fine.
They said it was impossible!!!!!  Kipchoge will go down on history for this remarkable effort..  Below is a YouTube link of normal people - who are not running superheros - trying to match his world record pace. Its well worth a watch   https://youtu.be/SRYtn0j5ccA
Kipchoge is an endurance machine!! He ran the fastest marathon ever in negative splits!!
However it will not be recognised as on official world record by the ahtletics federation. Due to the 40 pacers they used, keeping him out the wind and getting his nutrition from a motorguy.
I ran CC and Track, it took everything I had to run in the 4:40s for a single mile.  I ran year round, was in peak shape etc.  This guy just ran 4:35 per mile for 26.2 miles.  If that doesn’t amaze you, nothing will.
That's insane. He doesn't even look tired!
What’s that, roughly 26 5-minute miles?
That’s how he looks like nearing the end of a 2 hour marathon wtf? I look like that in a 100m sprint lmao
I'm not sure that many understand just how insane this really is.  I mean, I run, I'm not a massively strong runner but I can run a decent 5k of around 24 minutes, which is near 7.5 mph. Sub 20 is considered pretty quick; and that's around 9mph   I *cannot* run 13.1 MPH (his average) for much longer than a minute, maybe two. It's feels like nearly a sprint to me, as it would to most people. Your average American probably cannot hit 13 mph.  This guy is a god damn machine. And if you're doubting me, go run 13 mph for a 100m.
I honestly look more strained just sitting on the toilet
Totally correct bit in a normal race you’re not allowed so many and they don’t swap out. Plus this is not a recognised race so no world record. BUT incredibly impressive nonetheless
Thanks for info, never knew that
[This WIRED video goes in depth with the preparation for the run and science behind the drafting.](https://youtu.be/c6FS3D4a_kA)  It’s from before a previous attempt, but still relevant. Happened to watch it last night, unaware of the record attempt yesterday.
I see people look worse daily after walking up the stairs.
Yeah. He only ran for 2 h. Others run twice as long.
At his pace he would do 10k in about 28.4 minutes, which is quite close to the world record (and faster than the female world record)!
what does that mean?
To be fair lots of record keeps track fastest ever and fastest in competition I think the fastest ever 100m is by Tyson gay down a crazy sandhill in like 4.8 seconds  Edit def over hyperbolizes the sand run but someone link it it's more like 6 something? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a1sO7moXC-s
He still had the energy to run around and give the crowd some high fives!  What a lad
Or roughly 42 2:50 minute kilometres
sure it isn't within regulations - but every single advantage and corner had to be cut to achieve this - its just a feat of the human body.
"No, they don't run the whole race, just parts of it. The fact that so many others need to ""help"" one man do it shows how it's so impressive, and difficult to do.  It's been tried many times before, and many have come very close... the feat is considered to be at the absolute maximum the human body can physically accomplish naturally."
I'm in this comment and I don't like it. So I've been taking the stairs now instead of the elevator :) so long winded stair climb.
I mean isn't he also cros country 10 and 15 world champion :P  He like most great marathoners started at mid distance k think he also to this day has a top 20 10k time and a few crazy cross country records
It means he ran the second half faster than the first.
How do you run 100m down a sand dune without eating massive amounts of shit
exactly the same as the 4 minute mile, to do it at all was absolutely insane. For the record i think the 4 minute mile had 3 other pacers in the race.  The irony is that the pacers also broke the 2 hour record (if they were present from start to finish)
Amazing dude. Recognizing the need for a change and making steps towards it is one of the hardest things. DON'T STOP. you got this.
Wtf what a beast
He did not run each mile faster than the previous one. Not today, nor with his official world record. That would be almost impossible as you’d have to speed up 26 times.   The negative split is running the second half marathon faster than the first half, not every seperate mile.
They weren’t lol, there were 41 pacers in total swapping in and out
Not the same at all. In the 4 minute mile people thought you might actually DIE if trying to do it.   Pacers were hoping in and out of the race today - the standard for a world records is that they have to start the race with you (even with the bending of the rules there are only a couple guys good enough to do this).  There was an electric pace car set in front of them the whole way. They were able to take it more fluids than is allowed for a world record - AND they didn’t have to pick them up from a table or be handed them off.   He is wearing $300 shoes that are pretty much insane shoes unlike anything else in the sport right now. They have 4 pods filled with tensile strands that expand and release on impact, all sandwiched between 3 carbon fiber plates (unheard of in running).   The course itself would not qualify as world record eligible even if all the above wasn’t happening.   Many different reasons why this is not the same as sub 4 and not world record eligible.   This man is a freak athlete and this performance is wildly insane BUT it is not the same as the first sub 4. First it would need to be in a record eligible race.   There is an argument that Kipchoge is not even the GOAT - Kenenisa Bekele has the current 5k and 10k world records and last week missed Kipchoge’s WR in the marathon by 2 seconds in Berlin.
yeah, it wouldnt be that impactful if there were 5 other dudes breaking the record behind him too
This reads very salty for whatever reason.
Damn ur really gonna shit on a guy running over 26 miles in under 2 hours because of the way he got his water and his shoes??
How can you be so right and wrong at the same time?
To me it reads very informed
He keeps going on about a pro RUNNER having nice shoes... he mad
His facial expressions really seem to emphasize how much effort he must exert to get thousands of lbs to flip loosely through the air at his own will.
That’s what they are doing on fighter jets as well. Just with the masks and helmets on.  IIRC they are breathing a certain way while clinching their core and lower body to slow the flow of blood.
thats a cockpit view of Ryanair flight from Dublin to London

Someone needs to combine this with the hilary clinton wow gif
Me on shrooms.
The G force must be pretty insane. I've read top fuel funny car drivers can break ribs and lose teeth from the G force. These planes have even more G's.
He's pulling many G's in that inverted climb. You can see him clenching all his muscles to limit the blood traveling to his head and he still gets very red.
God could you imagine what it feels like to control that much power? Flick of the wrist and you can move so quickly you can black out.
As an American I always find it hilarious to hear about Ryanair. Great jokes
"Yep. Like Kool Aid Man, bursting through your door with a bag of coke in his hands, giving you the most intense     stare you could think of with his red ass face breathing crazy like a mong while shouting ""WHO'S READY TO GET FUCKED UP!?"""
Thanks for the explanation. For a minute, I thought he was feeling constipated. :(
Coming from someone who's done it, there's nothing like it in the world. Sustaining 6Gs while doing loops and rolls in the air is the peak of adrenaline junky activities.
You can tell it's a joke because this guy looks sober
Being constipated would be a god send vs taking centrifuge test lol
One thing I’d like to experience before I die. Sadly, likely the only time I could come close to it is to be wealthy enough to buy a stunt plan
I dont think you've ever been really constipated
https://migflug.com/flights-prices/fly-mig-29-in-russia/  It's not like an easily doable amount of money, but for a bucket list goal it's achievable for a decent number of people.
As a former heroin addict, agreed. You ain't live til you've pulled tree trunk sized pieces of dook out your bloody bootyhole. And then had to toss it in a plastic shopping bag because you don't want the pipes to break. And then felt your soul leaving your body while you try not to go again despite really needing to!  Ah I don't miss it.
That’s honestly not terrible for a bucket list item
Jesus christ if ever there was an anti-heroin advert, this story would be the best.  Glad you're clean now my man, that sounds fucking awful.
Paying for pilot, paying for maintenance.  Paying for people doing maintenance.  It is a specialized field, who else is competing at a rate cheaper or even similar?  Not to mention it still has to pull a good enough profit margin to be worth all that shit.  They aren't trying to break even I imagine.  Quite a lot more involved than renting a go-cart.
I was never a heroin addict but had this same problem thanks to shutting off the signals to the brain letting me know I would need to poop when being away from home for some days. Later in life I learned this ruins your intestines by the hardening poop beating your intestines up like a brick being tumbled in a rubber hose. [I now as an adult have to eat vegan and learn to cook for myself from sources like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_YSOrDRUTE&list=UUBAyDAs2M6klx0Q09DKmsHQ), on top of that I take fiber before every meal now too or else I will have painful shits that feel like I'm trying to birth baby golems out of my anus for the next couple days  Edit: *As for the shutting off signals to the brain thing everyone's asking about, while I can't do this anymore as an adult, nor would I want too, as a kid I was able to get my brain to not give me the urge to poop if I wasn't by a bathroom I was comfortable with, which during this time was strictly only the bathroom at my house. We would regularly go on camping trips for weekends and sometimes even weeks, and during the whole stay out camping I wouldn't need to poop because of this. I would do the same for school daily, spending all day long without the sensation of having to go drop a deuce,  but as soon as my body knew I was getting closer to the house bathroom I was comfortable with, then all hell would break loose and hours or occasionally days of poop sensation would come rushing into my brain like a phone being turned on after a month of being off getting bombarded with days worth of messages, text, emial's, notifications, etc.*
Minimum effort? He has legs for arms.
 He's actually a world champion in javelin throw (2005).  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrus\_V%C3%A4rnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrus_V%C3%A4rnik)  thanks to u/saltball for pointing out

#THE BEACONS ARE LIT
Ugh FINE. Yes I will have sex with you.
So which district is he from and when is the hunger games
I can't wait to see him fight Predator
Minimum effort aside from the decades he spent learning to throw javelins lol
*The Night King would like to know your location*
The efforts were intense, just not recorded
Jokes aside and for those curious, this is all in the legs, not his arms.  Look at his back foot, the way he twists and channels energy up from his back foot twisting, up into his hips, keeping his shoulders back up his hips open up, with his arm barely needing to do anything but accept the chain of energy rising up his body.  It might not look like much given the lack of running start, but he's doing a whole lot with his body to let that javelin fly.
His name is Andrus?? By Jove!

While this is cool, are skating competitions usually held at completely flat grounds like this?
A veritable young Rodney Mullen!
im starting to believe older adults more or less only know cotton eyed joe
I can do a half-ollie to a broken wrist combo.
Yup, the struggle is real.
Going through the same thing
It is! I'm hoping he got scouted by some skateboarding reps so he could get some new gear and maybe a sponsorship if they still do that.
There is a whole subset of skate culture that revolves around “flatground” skating, where the tricks are performed right off the ground, with no ramps or rails. It was born out of California around the same time that people started using ramps.  **Edit 1:** check out this [video of Rodney Mullen](https://youtu.be/1U-cgn3cEGA), who literally invented most of the tricks this kid was doing.  **Edit 2: I like this video even more:**  https://youtu.be/L6mJc7yeKPg  It’s much better video quality, and it covers a lot more of his range of skill (in different styles), with a focus on flatground style. And the music is better (and this is coming from a Alabamian, lol).  **Edit 3:**  Here is the first video, but with much better quality and music. This is the version from the video game *Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3*, which I played endlessly as a kid. Takes me way back...  https://youtu.be/V1YeMXE6Wn4  Thanks /u/r4r4me for digging this up!
I can only do a broken wrist.
Of course they do that dude       Guranteed this kid is sponsored by some one.
When it first lowered, I thought it was two dinosaurs carrying lanterns, looking over a cliff.  Real plot twist to realise it was something way less cool than dinos.
I’m having a hard time believing this 🤔
Was I the only one who thought the objects were paint tubes and that he was going to smash the board onto the table and the splatter marks would be some crazy picture?
What am I not seeing?
It kind of looked like a mountain to me at first, caught me off guard lol
Me too! I was like he do all that and it's some deformed looking dinosaurs.
It’s easier to believe when you see he has paper cut outs of the faces mixed in with all the objects
It’s the titanic arms out scene. The dinosaur looking things on top of the house looking things are the backs of their heads/hair, the white space is their faces
Ding ding ding. Right there.
no, its 3 dinosaurs having sex  2 standing up, and the front one doing the doggy style.
Wow...end products are gorgeous
"""People who buy things are suckers""   -Ron Swanson"
I’m always blown away when I see metal during the process. It’s dull, dirty, and misshapen. Then through their skill and lots of time, they mold it and polish it into something beautiful.   All hobbies that take something and make it into something completely different are made up of insanely talented and creative people.
What is this? A tiara for ants?
I appreciate the skill and artistry. But, to quote Pam Beesly, “heart shaped jewelry is not something a woman buys for herself.”
"That is exceptionally well made.  I know this is strictly personal opinion, but I found the final piece really gaudy, though. It screams ""Disney Princess"", like a tiara for your finger."

No silly, Just a tiara for your dick.
Lmao he may be the most skilled craftsman in the world but the product still looks like an expensive remake of a shitty plastic ring
Yet, idiots upvote them into the sky anyways.
Not everybody enjoys spending their entire life and every minute with people. So maybe your idea of avoiding is more like his recharging time. Please be more open to diverse people who don't act just like you.
Finally, now my dick can be a Disney Princess.
Aww, that’s a nice way to look at that.  And yes, he is a ‘loner’ who needs time by himself.  But, he really is sick and tired of his teenage kids and his wife cheated on him, so he doesn’t want to be around her either.   He does, however, enjoy his time with my husband - so much so that I refer to him as ‘his girlfriend’.  They race cars together and speak on the phone every day.   Maybe I should be jealous?   Naw- he’s just a guy who likes to do his own thing.   I’ve met a lot of them, the older I get.
Not impressed. She didn’t split the first arrow down the middle with the other two. To be honest I’m actually quite embarrassed for her. What a shame.
I want that hat.
I feel like not showing the distance they're shooting from really takes away from how impressive this is.
So dumb question. The straps the ladies have on IS for boob protection/ non interferance? Because the men dont have them
 Colombia! :)
And she didn't even have to cut a breast to perform like that.  I'm starting to believe that the stuff about Amazon warriors is fake.
What is that three armed silver thing attached to her bow?
She's so pretty!  IG: vofvadi
Not to mention totally blowing that last one... I may not follow the sport but I've seen enough Robin Hood films to know good archery when I see it...
[i gotchu fam](https://www.nautica.com/reversible-bucket-hat/HR9210.html)
Yeah back when I shot I was fairly good but and at 50 meters I was almost always in the reds or closer and at that distance it's hard to see the different colors
I was curious and it looks like the standard distance for junior recurve is 70m.  https://targetcrazy.com/archery/resources/world-archery-competitions/
They make archery chest guards for both men and women, but they're more common with the latter.   http://outdoornewb.com/why-do-archers-wear-chest-guards/
Fun fact: I did archery for a little while and they gave me (a guy) the chest guard thing. I’m pretty fit, so I was like, yeah makes sense; it’s cause of my muscular pecs. Turns out, my form was just shit ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
It’s a stabilizer to help keep the bow balanced.

For real, she didn’t even land the 3rd one in the smallest circle   This should be posted in r/secondtiertalent
Everyone knows if you don’t fire an arrow into the air, then fire a second one to spin the first by the fletching and nail a bullseye you aren’t *really* arching.

What is that in freedom units?

"Well, it's a myth, but it was a factoid that was spread like it was true for a really long time.   > It first surfaced in 490 BC when a patriotic Greek historian attempted to force a Greek meaning on the foreign word ""Amazon."" Because ""mazon"" sounded something like the Greek word for ""breast"" and ""a"" meant ""without,"" he claimed the name meant that the Amazons cut off one breast so they could draw a bow.  https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/13/world/warrior-women-amazons-horsewomen-archers-history/index.html"

my life is complete
In freedom units it’s a QB taking the first snap after kickoff and hitting his receiver in the end zone in his eyeball.
lol can you imagine your troll comment lasting 2000 years
No, because it's all split into different types of bows. Recurve, Instinctive and Compound.   This category falls under recurve, where assists like this are legal, there is the instinctive category where there is no assist allowed.  In the end, equipment doesn't do a whole lot if a person doesn't have proper form. Shooting without good form is like shooting a gun, but with varying amounts of powder in each bullet, it makes the sighting and equipment basically useless.
That one dentist might be mighty happy he didn't recommend this archer.
Quite accurate and gushing with freedom. I like it.
How appropriate. He had a head full of doodles. Hope he was happier than the end suggested.
At the start it looked like Donald Trump but then once it got to the forehead it changed the whole drawing
I like how he got lazy in the end and just stopped making faces.
Hate how scripted this is, and for all we know he had a reference layer of the portrait sitting underneath. The final zoom didn’t even resemble cartoon faces, so why screw around with a dumb fucking narrative. ‘This is just so inspirational’ ah get fucked...
"I remember watching Mr Williams in the ""Laugh In"" revival way back in 1977. What an incredible man, may he rest in peace."
I went from curious, to mildly interested, to a bittersweet feeling all so fast.  Robin Williams was definitely the hardest hitting celebrity suicide for me.  I went back and rewatched the original Aladdin recently and the mix of emotions was intense.
"Rip Robin Williams. Probably could have played trump in the hilarious upcoming comedy series called ""2020"" with a little forehead makeup and a wig. Lol."
He definitely did but I'm not quite gonna call it lazy
You can see from 0:23 to 0:25 that the entire scribbling pattern is completely different. They're not even related.
His initial concept was 'art with erased faces', then he realised it's too much work and just went with 'art from squiggly lines'
The camera sweep from the prize to his face.   Professional.
The creepy look and what the fuck is on his tooth?
I wonder what's in those prize tins
I remember last time this was posted somewhere, top comment said it's scripted or so. Apparently you can adjust the wobbliness or how the claw behaves, and that he's just the owner of the machine recording this for fun.
2000-2019 and this is the best skill I’ve seen so far?.. weird af 2019
Prize, to face, to spoils! Don't forget the 3rd act!
r/praisethecameraman
Looks like a major cavity.
Dentist here. Based on the location I highly doubt it's a cavity. Most cavities form on the chewing surfaces of the teeth, and if they do occur on the smooth, front facing surfaces they usually form along the gumline where plaque gets stuck. It's probably a piece of seaweed or something.
Probably a pot of putty that makes fart noises when you stick your finger in it
You can adjust the claw grip strength and close distance. Most people don’t suck at claw machines as much as they think. They’re just fucking rigged garbage. You start getting skill based claw games in Japan but even they require a certain amount of plays before anyone can win.
The producer (cameraman) is just as good as the performer I’d say.
Looks like a tooth gem

I remember the early days of ninja warrior, when it still looked kind of doable by a good number of fairly fit, agile people.  Now anything I see from the final rounds looks like a stage from an absurd video game challenge level that you end up having to call over *that* friend to finally beat. 
I do this kind of stuff in Uncharted all the time.
The frames of his girlfriend were each like straight out of r/GirlsMirin

As a rock climber, I wonder how well I'd fare on one of these courses. A lot of the earlier stuff don't seem too bad and not unlike what you'd see while climbing/bouldering. But that last section with the bar is an entirely different beast. I remember going to an obstacle course that had something similar where you just go straight up and there was a surprising amount of coordination involved in order to land both ends of the pole evenly.
"Rename this show ""American Rock Climber Warrior"", since all it is anymore is an upper-body challenge."
Holy shit, he won 1 million dollars?!  That's awesome, he deserves it.
I have the upper body strength of a gnat. Would not go well for me. 
New Assassin’s Creed game looks dope.
I don't like how ninja warrior has become rock climbing challenge. Anyone who doesn't have crazy rock climbing skills is done instantly. 
This was the genius of the Japanese Ninja Warrior. It was fun to watch because you felt like you *could* do it. They even had just normal people try the course every now and then. IIRC the original finalists were like, a fisherman, a fireman, and a gas station attendant.
Yeah, I was going to say... This looks like god tier stuff compared to last time I watched. As a climber, I feel so much sympathetic pain for his forearms. Like that is an amount of endurance that even top tier climbers may not have. Despite his obvious power, I'm guessing he is in a ton of pain at the end there. The pure psychological willpower to push through that pain is unimaginable to me.
Also, it looks 90% focused on hand and arm strength, 10% core strength, 0% legs
Haven’t watched these shows in years. The commentary is so cringey I have to mute it.   This has to be the most difficult course I’ve ever seen lol

Ninja warrior Lemmy**.
Her eyes got more watery the further he got through the course. It was super cute.
He definitely got laid that night!
Not gonna lie that man can pull off that facial hairstyle better than anyone I've ever seen. 
His name is Isaac Caldiero and he's the only winner of the show's grand prize after 9 seasons. Aside from this, he ran 3 more stages on the **same night**. The 1st was a speed intensive timed obstacle which mainly relies on footwork, balance, and agility. The 2nd was another timed obstacle but it relied more on upper body strength. The 3rd one is this, and the last one is a 75 foot rope climb that had to be done in 30 seconds.   Not to mention that they had to complete a qualifiers and finals round with a hundred other competitors in each city. Overall, there were around a thousand people that tried to get as far as possible.  Another guy (Geoff Britten) actually also completed the entire course the same night as him but Isaac did the last stage faster. They're the only 2 competitors to ever complete the entire thing. It's fucking crazy.  EDIT: This is American Ninja Warrior Season 7, if you wanna check it out. They're now on Season 10 and they're still the only 2 people to beat the show.
You and everyone except this man would fucking die
there's an episode of StarTalk Radio where the show/course creators discusse that the people that do best on American Ninja Warrior are rock climbers.
Should be more acrobatic... doing flips while throwing ninja stars and dodging arrows and shit.  Disarming traps, assassinating audience members, etc.
I was going to say. Of course it looks hard as fuck and the guy in the gif is a beast, but I would have liked to see some other types of obstacle that test non-rock climbing skills 
Said he was a fuckin busboy before being on show. Damn straight he deserves it.
Would gnot go well for you*
Makoto Nagano is still the GOAT Ninja Warrior
That's my gripe with the American version. Too many of the contestants are gym owners, personal trainers, or former collegiate gymnasts/athletes. I think there's a few that even own a ninja warrior training facility. 
Hell yeah, the original ninja warrior allstars were fun af to watch and keep up with! There was also the waste collector and the first winner that they always cried for because he always gave his ganbatte but clearly couldn't keep up with his friends anymore 😢
An eventual consequence of people training specifically for the course. It will become boring or more absurd. 
As a bodybuilder who occasionally dabbles in climbing (when I cut down weight) none of this looks even real to me. That guy is an actor and all this must be CGI because Jeebus Christ, he spend 3 minutes pulling himself up and making dyno moves using nothing but the last two knuckles of his fingers!!!!         That's ridiculous. 
Every single person who can be considered a contender is so far separated from me in both ability and dedication it's just mind boggling.  They're committed, and it shows. 
Ninja Warrior is pretty much just a climbing challenge these days. If you practice bouldering/climbing, you can succeed
That feet first approach was so cerebral!
Yeah so trash compared to the japanese original version of the show they would show on g4, they would show 17 other guys running the course in the time the US one shows the contestant's backstory and why they want to win, and not to mention all the cuts to their family. 
Pff, I bet you don't even know what the Assassin's Creed is.
Not all that got wet. 
Well he did just win a million dollars.  Gotta lock that up.
It’s the 19th British army officer look, so hot right now.
I remember the first time he appeared on the show I can't remember what season. I think he claimed to be one of the 1% top athletes in the world and at the time I scoffed and laughed at this dude.  Then a few seasons later he did it and I had to eat my words lol. 
"What got me is how little fucks he seems to give up until the last quarter of the vid. He's like ""pff, I could do this all night, it's relaxing really"". Probably just deep in focus, but the impression is out of this world. "
">Caldiero, a rock climber, has made V14 first ascents and 5.14 free-solos.[4] He started climbing at the age of 15,[3] and bouldering at 17,[5] and specializes in highball bouldering.[3] He became one of the first to ropeless climb a 5.14a, on one of the first 5.14a established climbs in the U.S., ""The Present"" in southern Utah.[3]  Yea... when someone's that strong and makes something look that unchallenging, it's easy to underestimate the actual moves. V14 is way above my send grade... but I'd still like to see how I'd do.  It's like that thing some people say about how olympic events should have a random person competing with the professionals, just so that there's a reference of just how truly dominating these athletes are compared to an average person."
You have to be.  American ninja warrior is nothing but grip strength.
Bus boy is just a coverup for him being Spider-Man 
Man that name took me back... I used to watch G4 Ninja Warrior with my grandma when I spent weekends at her house as a kid. I remember her favorite was a firefighter who wore orange pants, and my guy was a gas station manager. Good times.
Man, I wonder how Nagano trains for this?  ...Cut to him doing a handstand on his boat...
you have to be a rock climber to win, there's pretty much no way around it
As a fat, lazy slob, this looks, I dunno... kinda hard to do, I guess... 
so the only difference between them and you and I is ability and dedication. other than that we’re just like this guy!
Breezed through it so easily he only lost to Isaac Caldiero from the original post by 1 minute 13 seconds. What do you know, Isaac is also pretty much a professional climber.
">	If you practice bouldering/climbing, you can succeed  Easy peasy. "
Your right, my hands got sweaty af
It's also crazy to think that he was relatively new to the sport when he started. Comparing his obstacle course experience against other guys who have been competing for more than a decade, he was definitely an underdog. It was his 4th time competing when he won.
He doesn't look relaxed at all. From the very start of the vid his face is pure concentration, making sure he conserves as much energy as possible.
>It's like that thing some people say about how olympic events should have a random person competing with the professionals, just so that there's a reference of just how truly dominating these athletes are compared to an average person.  I'd do that. I volunteer as tribute. 
Don't be sad.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Caldiero  > Caldiero was awarded a $1,000,000 cash prize after completing Stage 4 in a faster time than Britten.
Man, G4 was the shit back then. Ninja Warrior and Attack of the Show were bomb. Fell hard for Olivia Munn and Sara Underwood lol. Was a sad day when G4 was no longer a channel. 
THIS. about half way through i was like is this just rock climbing + ?
As a guy who loves videogames and Cheetos, I was 6 ft under around the 2 minute mark. 
If the competition actually had an equal amount of flexibility, lower body, and upper body strength, then he would be at a pretty heavy disadvantage against people training specifically for ninja warrior. But watching this (and from what other people have said in this thread) it seems like being a professional climber is all that's necessary. I mean this guy has twigs for legs compared to his upper body and he still won.
But guys a professional mountain climber, obstacle course experience not needed
 This unsads me.
If their is one thing I've learned form this show, it's the rock climbers are the best at these obstacle courses and it's not even close. 
Damn

This man has been pulled out of an anime and you aren't going to convince me otherwise.
What’s that exercise the guy is doing - lifting weights with his abs? Looks promising
u/tornudders, you agree?  Edit: Not real  Edit: someone made it
Oh, 🤔 I’ll brb, I.....😬...gotta return some tapes...
The thing that I've realized with celebrity nude leaks is that they only matter if I know who the celebrity is. If I don't (95% of the time), it's just another naked person, and probably not the one I was searching for to begin with. These people aren't especially sexy, so let's leave them alone. Just go look at regular porn.

Well, since Ip Man was Bruce's teacher, I think he might acquiesce to his master's skill.

Not the Ferrari prancing horse but still a work of art
Heard a guy once say that I could practice playing pool for a whole year, while he didn’t play once, and I wouldn’t beat him. I have a feeling I could probably do that. This, on the other hand.... I think I could spend the rest of my life trying, and I’d never be able to do that.
No gloves is a bold move. Impressive.
That smug look at the end. Awesome.
hi quite impressed, i'm... oh ffs sorry
Just press control z if u made a mistake
Just to demonstrate how hot the piece still is.
yeah this is super cool but before I clicked the link I bet myself another glass of wine that it was going to be a black horse, and not *the* black horse.
"I thought as soon as I saw the title, ""I bet by Ferrari logo OP just means a fucking horse.""   Pretty much any glass blower beyond the beginner stage can make this horse, definitely doesn't take a ""Murano glass master."" I had a buddy in college who learned this after like 3 months of glass blowing. They churn these horses out by the hundreds.  OP is terrible in pretty much every regard when it comes to this title."
"I played pool in a casual league for two years and got pretty good. My mum who hasn't ""hustled for beer jugs"" since she was 20ish (50 now) told me she could destroy me... I laughed. Five losses in a row and she won't ever let me forget it"
Glassblowers hardly ever use gloves, it impedes your motion and glass blowing requires a lot of dextrous movements, you usually have someone helping you with larger pieces to shield the heat when you work the glass.
At least 2 minutes and 24 seconds from my knowledge
Stupid Anti Flanders
If u log out real quick it won’t save and U can go back
The paper, if I am seeing it correctly, helps to blacken the outside
I've been to this factory twice. They make the same exact horse for every tour group.
Pool can be like that. I grew up with a pool table and always used to be down the pub or the snooker hall with my dad playing pool. When I moved away I saw a sign in the local pub saying they were looking for players so I decided I'd like to play again. Even after not picking up a cue for 3 or 4 years, I was a bit rusty but still had it.   I've played pub league for about 5 years now but my dad still wins more often than not. Sometimes I forget that he taught me everything I know.
Maybe. But on this occasion it’s definitely used to show how hot the glass still is
so a one trick horsey?
He didn't teach you everything he knows though just to make sure he always wins.  That's true dad power.
It caught fire, so it must be about as hot as a hot pocket.
Is he fucking BLIND?!?
 This guy is an actual fucking hero.
I’m still over here trying to do an ollie wtf
This is awesome, though I'm wondering why a blind skateboarder wouldn't want to wear any pads, or even (gasp) a helmet?
I like how he can still skate at night lol

Yes
Nah, just regular blind.
It’s a shame we can’t show this to the people he’s a hero for
I was about to say, I bet it's even harder to try at night, then I was like oh wait
***REALLY?!***
Just upload it as braille
Look at Tony fucking Hawk over here.
yes this is humorous hahahaha
Yeah there’s a video of him in a park doing a sick grind. It’s insane
He already was uploaded on braille.  Fantastic skateboarding youtube channel.

From what I understand: deciding if something is a dildo is a direct function of the individuals bravery.
Definitely a punting ball
Nobody did.
But the bravery of Paige knows no bound and hence she must be stopped.
Some kids in my high school filled a basketball with water and put it in the freezer. They then rolled it to some year 7s and asked them to kick it back.
Yeah buuuut if you did ask him, he’d say it seems like a waste of some good wood
At the NY Renaissance Faire, September 7, 2019, since verified by the Guinness Book of World Records.
But can he juggle whips while *he's* on fire.
Is it possible to be cut with the whip and have the cut cauterized at the same time?
Soooo....the previous record for juggling flaming whips was...two?  Or maybe one?  I was honestly expecting someone to come into frame with a few more flaming whips and add them in to set the record.
Not to downplay this guy’s awesome talent but do world records matter when they become this specific?  I believe I hold the world record for eating the most Taco Bell tacos in a taxi while traveling down 83rd street on a Friday night under a harvest moon.
Amazing, what specifically is the record counting though? Number of throws?
I'm gonna try to set that world record
Like a lightsaber?
The record is number of whip-cracks in 60 seconds.
Some of those records no one even wants. Running the furthest backwards, number of nails eaten in a minute, coconuts karate chopped in a minute, chainsaw jugging, etc. Some are funny or cool (biggest pancake or cookie type shit), but is there really a stiff competition for flaming whips?
Absence of facial burns?
Maybe it's just number of whips. Three isn't usually a lot, but when it's 'number of flaming whips you can keep in the air without getting scarred for life', it's plenty.
the size of the FLAMES brother
George Lucas is probably driving to your house right now to give you a hug, you're the one person who finally got it.
Then why is your title saying something completely contrary to that
Jedi's killed I think is the measure.
I assume he means the record for juggling flaming whips is measured by number of whip cracks.  I think somebody could manage more whip cracks of normal whips if they wanted to.
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
The split sequence looks painful
Brothers Fayard and Harold Nicholas dancing in the 1943 film “Stormy Weather.” Years later, Harold recalled that they never rehearsed the jumps over each other’s heads but still managed to do the routine in just one take.
Doing multiple turbo splits is one thing, but do you know how strong you have to be to raise yourself to a standing position from the splits position that smoothly without relying on your hands to lift you? Absolutely amazing.  The other thing I love about these guys is that they are not doing EXACTLY the same steps all the time, and that each guy has his own panache with his individual hand and head gestures. That makes it seem like they are just having fun with this routine that no doubt took an immense amount of practice. Sometimes, if you look at MGM musicals, their dance sequences are too formal and perfectly synchronized and beneath the plastered on smiles you can tell they’re just concentrating as hard as they can instead of having fun. This is a lot more fun to watch.
Anything that requires far-above-average talent or skill is r/toptalent. **Upvote this comment if this post belongs. Downvote if it doesn’t.**
I still can't wrap my head around the fact that the world was black and white back then
Is that definitely just one take, with the camera cuts?
My balls wriggled and went inside
You can tell by the momentary hesitation and how they slowed down by a half second after each one that they're in real pain
He 100% hurt his knee with his last split-jump though but continued like nothing happened.   What a champ.
That's incredible if they really never rehearsed the jumps (even if not on the actual stairs here, but just to make sure they could do it safely while landing on a ledge, repeatedly).  Truly top talent.
I wonder if They were an influence for Les Twins.
There is a great documentary, Pleasantville, which shows how the change happened. It’s quite amazing.
Camera A and camera B.  You’d definitely want to film it with multiple cameras.  I’m not saying that there’s nothing fishy with the one take thing, just saying that there’s nothing fishy about two cameras.
Dont worry bro, ill pull them back out for you
Also, no osha

You are not alone in that sentiment.
I used to buy cars from auctions all the time. It’s fun as hell. The cadence is pretty easy to follow after a few minutes. You just gotta know who you are bidding against and make sure the auctioneer isn’t bidding you against the coke machine to run the price up.   I gotta see if I have some of my old auction videos now.
As a ling time fan of rap and hip hop, I can’t tell if I hate mumble because it’s awful, or because I’m getting old.
Never seen this before and it's fucking beautiful  That auction house + rap beat combo, reminded me of a badass song I'd completely forgot about  [Let's Go (ft. Twista, Yelawolf, Busta Rhymes)](https://youtu.be/UWt1y8tSXHE?t=11) (produced by Travis Barker)
He’s considered by many to be the best of the beat rap auctioneers
These are livestock auctions so yes. They probably give a more authentic cowboy feel to sell more.

Everyone gets buff when they go to prison. Some just get brain buff 
">""It's only going to take a second before you have tattoos on your face and have given up and completely don't care at all.

Edit: you guys seem to think this is a quote from the guy who became an attorney. It is not. It's a quote from his cellmate who worked in the library and encouraged him to fight his charge.   Edit 2: As someone who has never been incarcerated before, I've only experienced the word inmate as a descriptive term. I did not realize how loaded and negative the term feels to individuals who have been incarcerated. I have edited the comment above to contain more neutral language. "
*Adams' sentence was eventually overturned and the charges dropped, for the exact reason that he had found in the prison law library books: ineffective assistance of counsel.*  This whole thing started because of a poor legal defense after he couldn't afford to hire an attorney.  I bet this man goes the extra distance to help others  in similar circumstances.
Prison library - dang that’s nice
"It's the shit like this that pisses me off when people say ""Oh what's wrong with the justice system? Seems to be working just fine... If you're innocent you don't have anything to worry about. Only criminals go to jail."" 10 years!!! TEN FUCKING YEARS!!! Could you imagine what it is possibly like to spend 10 years of your life in prison for something you didn't do? On top of that here's this nice shit sandwich Wisconsin want you to eat:            **Exoneree Compensation**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wrongfully convicted person ""who did not by his or her act or failure to act contribute to bring about the conviction and imprisonment for which he or she seeks compensation"" can receive a **maximum of $25,000, including attorneys fees**, as long as the claimant did not contribute to or bring about conviction. The Claims Board may petition legislature for additional funds. Effective: 1913; Amended most recently: 1987.      25000?? twenty five god damn thousand? What can you do with that? That's no where near enough. That is pathetic and a whole lot of people's feet need to be held to the fire. I am glad that Jarrett Adams was able to turn a negative into a positive, but holy fuck I am fuming mad."
Damn, that’s not only great for him, but that’s fucking smart. I hope he got compensated hardcore, because those ten years he lost are beyond priceless.
So you're telling me a self-taught man who was in prison now knows more about law than attorneys that went through law school amongst other prerequisite degrees? Either this dude is crazy smart, or the education system is just straight trash...or both. 
As a prison librarian this makes me very proud to provide a safe space and relevant information to this truly underserved population. Knowledge really is power.
This needs to be a movie! 
People get buff to show dominance or fight off bullies. But this guy, he has a set goal. I always wonder what’s going through their minds when they get falsely imprisoned and that too for 10 years. Glad he had faith in himself and didn’t just accept what was given!
Don't never skip brain day brah

>You need to go down swinging.  This is good. Thank you.  Edit: I’ve heard of the expression before but for some reason reading that was something I really needed today.   Man, y’all the best, lol
Great outlook to have, but you can't really blame the people who give up. The only reason this guy got a second chance was he worked every day to claw himself out of that hole, most prisoners don't have the motivation to work hard to fit into a society that disregards them. 
I also love the irony that the untrained layman was able to specifically prove how incompetent the trained lawyer was, at lawyering.      Edit: [We're lawyers!](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dnxd8UZ-LTI)
I'm extremely happy for this man.  Poor legal defense, is sometimes the public defender's office who are overwhelmed with the number of cases they have and don't have the time to commit to every case.  That's what I learned from the documentary Gideon's Army.
Guy actually wrote a letter every day to get grant money to buy books. Hell, he even helped a punk-ass kid to pass high school equivalency. 
The Supreme Court has held that “the fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful legal papers by **providing prisoners with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.**”  *Bounds v. Smith*, 430 U.S. 817, 828 (1977).  So, where in person assistance is not given, access to libraries must be provided.   Edit: [link to citation](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/430/817/case.html)
This is why I'm always worried about people trying to lower the standard for conviction. It is already too low in many cases.  I mean, there are some awful crimes that absolutely deserve to be punished but very rarely provide the evidence for a conviction, and that is awful, but the solution isn't to make it easier to throw more people in jail.
Well... to be fair, $25,000 in 1913 was over $600k today?
I  worked with someone that did ten years. He probably wasn't right to begin with but he was really damaged afterwards.
Also, important point here, he got his law degree.
People work out in prison cause it's boring and a good workout will take your mind off your situation. And it makes you tired so your not tossing and turning all night. 
This... could mean different things
Hello, fellow Harvard graduate.
You've never heard that expression?
One thing, keep in mind that ineffective counsel isn’t the same as legal malpractice nor does it truly reflect badly on the lawyer. In most appeals, this defense is made. 
*Purposefully underfunded and therefore understaffed offices, almost as if to tip the balance slightly 
last amended in 1987. Your point holds, but it isn't nearly that now. However, it definitely sounds like it's time to amend again to compensate for inflation over 30 years.
What I dont get is how they get the caloric excess and protein to get so hench....
Either way, you will wind up getting ahead.
I see you're also a connoisseur of quantum mechanics 
Nope. 
>keep in mind that ineffective counsel isn’t the same as legal malpractice nor does it truly reflect badly on the lawyer.  Yes it does. Ineffective assistance means the lawyer committed malpractice in the criminal context. If a civil lawyer blew your case and appeal by failing to make a proper objection or something else that would give rise to an IAOC claim in the criminal context, you bet your ass that lawyer's malpractice carrier would be paying out.  >In most appeals, this defense is made.   IAOC is not a defense. It is a means of raising an argument on appeal when your trial lawyer fucked up and didn't raise it/preserve it below, which would normally mean it is waived on appeal. If your IAOC succeeds and you get a reversal, it means the trial lawyer fucked up bigtime. 
It’s more than slightly. It’s a heavy imbalance. The only logic I’ve heard supporting this imbalance is that it’s hard to get voters behind raising the funding. It’s not a great argument.
[Now you're bein' acute](https://i.imgur.com/hPzVTxa.jpg)
They feed you the portion meals I think three times a day the rest they have to buy extra like instant ramen and those types of snacks I think they just bulk up on those snacks 
Https://xkcd.com/1053/
Yeah, god forbid you spend money on rehabilitating people back into society...
Buy food on commissary or work in the kitchen to eat extra, haha. I worked in the kitchen at the prison I was in and made $17 a week. Worked everyday from 9AM-7PM. And that was one of the highest paid jobs in the prison. Others work for pennies an hour. Doesn't mean some people don't make money though. The guy that was running gambling pools would send home like $800/week to his family. He had been doing that for 6 years by the time I got there. So people involved in things like drugs and cell phones make thousands, literally.  I made money on the side playing poker and other random stuff but mainly I got money from my family so I wasn't too uncomfortable, had a TV and got books sent in, that kinda stuff. At the place I was at you could spend $120/week. There's times where thats not enough because you're just bored and eat for happiness. It's something that distracts you.  As for protein I just bought pouches of tuna and ate maple and brown sugar oatmeal with peanut butter. I'm a pretty picky eater and you don't have many options in prison, but you won't get big on the prison diet alone, just isn't enough. Also another benefit of working the kitchen. So you can definitely bulk up, some really keep a good diet too and you can tell because those are definitely the bigger people.  Edit: To add the tuna was only $1.79 for like a small sized pouch, but each had 18 grams, and the slightly larger one for $3.15 was 28g of protein. 
Of fucking course there's a relevant XKCD.
I'm American and for some reason I always thought it meant swinging your arms while in a fight you're losing.
Thats funny. Here in europe, all lawyers have to take public defense cases. They get them assigned periodically, and if they want to stay lawyers, they have to take them. All attorneys have to participate and they only get like four cases a year. (they are obviously compensated for this by standard tariff minimum so its not their best work, however, the system checks for their mistakes very thoroughly, and if they mess up, they can be kicked off the bar association easily, so they try just as hard)
Man, I made 5€/day in the military (later raised to 11,70€/day as a platoon leader), and I was pissed off at my friends who worked at the grocery store over the weekend when they were complaining about their 20€/hour pay. I guess prison pay puts things into perspective even more.
For sure, you realize it's an industry of it's own. From the food suppliers, private medical companies, there is just so many jobs created by the corrections industry. Some prisons outsource their labor for a large amount and use prisoners that are paid pennies and hour. You have states not getting medical marijuana legislation passed through because their prison guard union lobby's to have it blocked, knowing a giant portion of their inmates are nonviolent drug offenders.  Some prisons and jails actually do try to rehabilitate their inamtes, the wardens actually see the problem and care. But for every prison that is rehabilitation based you have like 20 prisons that are just warehousing cheap laborers. They offer nothing for rehabilitation and take even more prisoners from other prisons to make more money.   It's honestly just an evolved version of slavery at some point. A PA judge got caught not long ago sending kids to prison for long sentences to receive kickbacks.
So to sum it up in a not short way:  Basically got drug possession/parephenalia charge while on probation for a stupid simple assault. So violated that probation, and got probation for the other charges. Well, I was a hardcore opiate addict at the time and continued to use and got caught, so 3 more violations. So I had to do all 3 probation sentences in prison, luckily they all ran concurrent so only had 18 months.   So really I could've gotten 18 months followed by 12 months followed by 12 months more but the judge was relatively lenient given my circumstances. He said he doesn't like sending people to jail for failed drug tests in the first place but since I was on county parole that got aggregated he couldn't do much.  He brought that up because a few months prior the state passed a bill that stopped sending state parolees back to prison for just failing drug tests or not paying court costs. Technical violations. They realized it doesn't make sense and costs taxpayers a lot. But some counties like my own continue to do so but again, it's just another industry. They still send people to jail and prison for tech violations but if you're lucky and an addict you can shoot for treatment. My county has contracts with rehabs and treatment centers so now they just send you to a locked rehab and tax payers foot the bill. They send these young guys to jail for petty shit and they come out professional criminals. I mean they just got done rooming and boarding with felons for stealing an iPod from Walmart. They aren't exactly gonna come out a better person. 
Striking out instead of watching the last pitch.
Prisons should never be privately owned for profit businesses. No idea why anyone thought that would help bring justice. 
Private prisons would work in a perfect world where people don't purposefully try to lock up more people in order to increase revenue, but we're far from a perfect world.  Initially it sounded like a decent idea, cheaper on tax payer, creates a lot of jobs, less work for government, etc.  Problem is private industries almost never self regulate, so there needs to be some sort of major buffer between the person owning prisons and the person sending people to prison and even the people making laws that determine what is and isn't illegal.
*After a mere 3 weeks of therapy, Kris started showing signs of improvement, and within 2 months he could answer the phone, write his name and operate a wheelchair. He had regained significant improvement in his motor functions; which are the transmissions of messages from the brain to muscle groups to create movement.*  What a wonderful gift for him to get his mobility back and what an inspiration this must be to so many others.
"Wow that's huge. According to the article, current stages of treatment allow ability to ""use one's arms and hands,"" which is a great improvement to the quality of life of anyone who's paralyzed!"
I'm a paralyzed individual that has been waiting for stem cell research to advance since the day I was injured.   I'm so happy right now to know that people like me can be healed soon. 
I'm glad we are finally opening up to the use of stem cells. It's long over due. 
And yet we aren't fully funding research because wackos are convinced stem cells come from aborted fetuses.  But, let's spend money on that wall, tho.
My Dad paid out of pocket for stem cell work on his back - he wasn’t able to stand more than 10 minutes before the pain got to him. He owns his own printing company, so that wasn’t working for him at all. After 2 treatments, he is SO much better!! He can stand for hours, exercise like he used to, and no more pain! He had to pay out of pocket, but it was definitely worth it!  Edit: wow, this blew up! Let me talk to my Dad and find out more info and I will post it here ASAP!   Edit 2: Okay, I talked to my Dad and here’s all the info! My Dad lives in California (USA). He had his treatment done five years ago by Dr. Jason Miller, who he met through Regenx(?), but who now has his own company specializing in stem cell work. He had two sessions total, six weeks apart, that total to $4000 out of pocket. His diagnosis was a deteriorating disc in his back from an old injury. He said the largest hospital is in La Jolla under the name GioStar. He said they take your blood and process it and then basically re-inject you, he said it’s not too painful although the first one was worse than the second. He told me his brother-in-law also had stem cell work done on his knees and wrists, but he went to a different doctor as they specialize in different areas of the body. I hope this helps!
We have to be careful with this technology. We don't want paralyzed people to suck out The stemcells from aborted featuses, gaining superpowers and start fighting Gene Hackman.  We could use it to create more shanky's pizzas though 
Regarding funding: husband opted to pay out of pocket for stem cell rotator cuff repair (insurance would pay but only for traditional surgery) stem cell surgery cost $12k vs the $800 that would have been the insurance overage. He recovered better than new, conventional surgery expected 60-75% recovery. Our Dr. Suggested we write a letter outlining our experience for the insurance company because even though this Dr (who has been using this procedure for more than 10 years successfully) the insurance companies refuse to pay for any part of it. It's worth noting that the stem cells came from my husband's own fat cells, apparently stem cells from our bodies'  own fat, when injected into our cartilage or tendons will grow into brand spanking new cartilage and tendon and fill in seemlessly to repair damage.
The original article is from 2016. I wonder if he's made any other improvements since then.
"For those of you saying ""fund this!"", I can assure you that there's a TON of stem cell research and clinical trials going on. They're not a magic bullet yet, but some research is very promising. I can give you an example from my own experience:  five years ago my wife suffered a stroke (at age 43), leaving her with very limited mobility on one side, along with some cognitive deficiencies. A little over a year ago she was accepted into phase 2 of a clinical trial, where genetically modified stem cells were injected directly into the brains of patients who were several years post-stroke (brains were imaged in great detail and injections were made around the area of damage). No results are available yet from this phase, but in the very small phase 1 of the study several patients had dramatic improvement (one was able to raise her arm above her head the next day, when before treatment she could barely move it at all). That being said, some patients in the first phase had minimal to no improvement, and my wife has not had any response from her treatment, which was over a year ago now.  From what I've been able to learn about clinical trials in this time, if the treatment in this story (which I believe is from 2016) had this dramatic result for a statistically significant number of participants, it would have been fast tracked and been more widely available by now.  There's a lot of money to be made in this, since pharma companies will be developing the lines of stem cells that will be used, so once something is proven safe and effective you can bet that it will be made available.  My wife's study was pharma (not government)  funded, although the study PIs are university based. As for our own situation, we're now anxiously waiting for word  on what study group my wife was in - there were two different dosages of stem cells, and one control group (the control group got a ""sham surgery"" - they really drilled into the skull, but not all the way, and then just pretended to inject the cells). 52 patients in each group. If she was in the placebo group, as we suspect, then she could potentially be eligible for Phase 3 of the study, where they will be evaluating different dosages of the cells and all patients will really receive the treatment."
This literally sounds like magic to me! Amazing breakthrough by everyone involved...
Anytime i read stuff like this, I can’t help but think of Family Guy’s “how are we not funding this?!” and South Park’s Christopher Reeves sucking stem cells through a dead fetus. Truly a remarkable thing! 
The bad part is how delayed the research on this treatment has been for years because of conservatives. Even now I believe the Govt shutdown has caused a lot of research to not just stop but go backwards because their stem cells wouldn't last or something (I forget)
This is amazing.    I became paralyzed in 2013. It took me 3 months of intensive physical therapy almost everyday in order for me to walk with a walker/use a wheelchair. It took me more to eventually be able to walk on my own, although quite wobbly.   My whole body is still far weaker then before, my legs feel like they’ll fold after walking around for just a few minutes. My right hand works but might forever be only able to open to the claw position. After writing or gaming for a while my hand just starts to burn up. My sense of temperature got messed up so now my lower body feels things hotter compared to my upper body.   This is all after 1 emergency surgery, therapy, another surgery to install ladder-shaped rods in my neck for support, more therapy, and a cyber knife procedure.   Over 5 years of doctors appointments.  So if Kris can use a wheelchair in 3 weeks vs my 3 months - it really does give me hope.
">current stages of treatment allow ability to ""use one's arms and hands,"" which is a great improvement to the quality of life of anyone who's paralyzed!  There's a Norm Macdonald joke in here somewhere."
Tell mom she's off the hook. 
It's important to note that the fine print on the company's website does indicate that treatment is only appropriate for those with injuries two to six weeks old.

Please dont abuse them like Christopher reeves did though. Gene hackman doesnt have enough fight in him to save another town. But i trust you will be responsible with them!
shoulders of giants! 
The Family Guy bit where Peter is cured of his stroke and says “Why aren’t we funding this!?” In reference to stem cells comes to mind
I was thinking the same thing, the idea is nothing new but actually being able to see it work after it being frowned upon for so long.
I train BJJ, so know a bunch of people who've had various soft-tissue injuries repaired at some point. There's a guy in his early 30s there who's had multiple shoulder surgeries - the odds of re-injuring it after a surgery are exponentially higher. Each time he has less range of motion and it takes him nearly a year to recover to the point that he can work out even a little bit. There's another guy in his mid-50s there who tore his rotator cuff about 3 years ago and got the stem cell treatment. He was back working out (in a limited capacity) in about 2 months and fully recovered in under 6 months, and that shoulder is his *good* shoulder now.
No...and I hate to be negative but I have relatives who could really benefit from this but I doubt it'll be widely available in our lifetime. I don't ever get excited about these big medical breakthroughs because it always feels like you hear about them once and then they never get mentioned again. I guess it's nice that some guy I'll never meet is doing better but my grandad could use this, like now. 
"""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" Clarke's Third Law"
Yes!! This is exactly what I'm talking about. My mom's trying to get one of these. Without it she's going to die. It's crazy how much of a change stem cells can create and how many applications they have. We've probably only scratched the surface of everything we could do with them.
We're getting to the point where people are gonna be culturing their own stem cells in basements and injecting them wherever the pain is. No one with paralysis, degenerative muscular/nerve conditions, or bad arthritis is going to be willing to wait on such miraculous outcomes.
(long silent stare into camera while audience uncomfortably titters)
I'm guessing 19 years is a little late then. Oh, well. We'll get there eventually!
So *thats* where stem cells come from...

Thank your ass that for 8 years, you ~~had~~ *had* an educated president. 
South park Reference IIRC 
WHY THE FUCK WONT INSURANCE PAY FOR THIS
A lot of pro-athletes are getting stem-cell treatments for injuries now.  It's common.  So I don't agree we're as far away from wider adoption as you believe.  If you tore your ACL, you could go get stem cell treatments tonight.    https://www.regenexx.com/conditions-treated/knee/acl/
Can we please become Gods now?   Can we pick our God names?  Let's just hope it doesn't bring our Titanomachy, killed by our own creations  
It’s crazy how stem cell research was an extremely controversial political topic in the late 90s and early 2000s. This tech could have been saving lives years ago. 
Totally a thing already. Unfortunately there's a reason we have the process we have, as slow and deficient as it may be sometimes. People can and do hurt themselves trying to go it alone, although I can hardly blame them for wanting to try.
many people say this is a great day for science, well I say it's a great day for people who like to move their armss and legs!
With the way science is advancing in this area, most likely sooner rather than later! 
South Park made an episode where Christopher reeves was farming aborted fetuses and would crack them open to suck out their stem cell juices to gain super strength...basically the scare tactic bullshit republicans pull.
Apparently he poured millions of his own money into private stem cell research, and used the untested therapies on himself. People who knew him said that it worked at first, but the tests continued to become more and more experimental and dangerous. Reeve didn’t care, and he desperately tried to find anything that worked. Many suspect that it was because of this that in 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and— nah, jk, I’m not shittymorph. 
We really need to start farming giants on a larger scale.
This is the only answer. Any other argument someone tries to give against it is either bullshit and they know it, or it finds its way back to religion somehow.   E: typo
Actually, the majority of the issue the 'religious zealots' have isn't with stem cells, but embryonic stem cells. The majority of stem cell research that has produced any real effect has been from adult stem cells. The argument from the religious side is to follow the path of adult stem cell research, not to get rid of it entirely.  Edit: Just a little more info on why they don't approve, essentially, abortion. More info on the study he was part of, the while the majority of stem cells research has had results from adult stem cells, this one was in fact done using embryonic stem cells that were modified and changed into a type of fully formed(considered adult) stem cells(oligodendrocytes- nerve cells). I'm not quite sure why they couldn't use adult stem cells in that case, if anyone has more information I'd love to hear it!
High risk of profiting them less than conventional treatments
Stay Puff
It’ll end up like the big .com boom of registering domains.  Some jerk is gonna take all the good God names first and sell them back to us for profit.
The issue before (if I understand correctly) is that at first they were using embyronic stem cells, which anything embryo related is controversial, even if it's from like cord blood.  Now they've come up with procedures to use your own, adult stem cells. It's pretty awesome. For my mom they would literally harvest her stem cells, give her a shit ton of chemo to completely destroy her immune system, and then put the harvested cells back in. The harvested cells then recognize there's a lack of an immune system, and they become a new immune system. (That's a pretty simplified version of it at least).  It's amazing. Mom's disease is autoimmune, so the immune system attacks her nerves. So by destroying and replacing her immune system, the disease should be gone.
I 100% pictured Norm at his desk, saying this. And I heard it in Norm’s voice. This is perfect.  Someone find that Holocaust denier, Adam Eget, and tell him to make Norm do this one.
I wonder if surgically re-injuring the same neural tissue but then treating it this way could improve function? Similar to re-breaking a bone to set it right.
When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!
Interesting question. I don’t know nearly enough about this stuff to comment accurately on that. With that said, scarring of neural tissue is one of the reasons that these types of lifelong injuries persist, because the scar tissue (which never goes away) blocks signal pathways. I would imagine that removing the scar tissue, and in the process likely re-injuring the original tissue, could indeed be potentially treated with stem cells. Again, I don’t know enough about this to know if it’s possible, but it seems logical to me. 
The first time ever my “that doesn’t surprise me” reaction was positive  Edit: Thanks for silver kind stranger. Keanu would definitely approve!
I really like hearing about Reeves, because he seems content to deny stereotypes about the rich and famous for no better reason than he doesn't see himself that way.  I still remember when people were freaking out because he said that you don't need constant happiness to have a good life. Inspiring. 
"*""I have a private foundation that’s been running for five or six years, and it helps aid a couple of children’s hospitals and cancer research. I don’t like to attach my name to it, I just let the foundation do what it does.""*  What a man, we truly do not deserve Keanu."
Genuine hero, and not only because of using platform to create good deeds but also because of not using those good deeds to promote his platform.  True morality is doing the right thing while not expecting any reward or fear of punishment.
Fucking hero. Everytime. In everything he does. 
>Hollywood Superstar Keanu Reeves Has Secretly Been . . .    Oh no!!  What horrible, depraved shit has another beloved celebrity been up to?    >Financing Countless Children’s Hospitals  Whew!
I freely admit my bro-crush on this fabulous man. *Edit*: This is now my highest voted comment, thank you strangers! Going to brag to my students on Monday...you'll probably see memes of me on r/fellowkids that afternoon but whatever.
/r/KeanuBeingAwesome
Awesome guy !!!  He has experienced plenty of heart ache.
"No need to add ""Hollywood Superstar"" to his name. We all know who he is."
Keanu Reeves is an awesome guy, in fact when I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. SO when there i am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in, but Keanu Reeves. I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Keanu, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Keanu put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.
Since we are in the business of electing celebrities to political office in the USA... I think Keanu Reeves should run for something! Not even a civil servant and trying to serve others!
MOST EXCELLENT!!!
This man is honestly the only reason I haven't killed myself. With all the hard things I've gone through the death of my child and the seperation of my wife and I and a few others that snowballed while I was lost . I see how he treats everyone and how he fills his voids by doing good deeds and asks for nothing in return. As far as I am concerned this is the man that took over mother theresas life when she left this world .
Doesn't want any unnecessary attention. Such a class act.
Right? I saw his name at the top and my heart stopped for a minute before I realized it was a good deed.   *phew*
"I legit said ""Of course he did"" to myself when I saw the headline and then laughed because usually that goes the other way."
Keanu is an awesome human being, but this article indulges in some hyperbole.  Keanu said that his foundation helps out a couple of children’s hospitals. How did that translate to “financing countless children’s hospitals”?  Also they make the claim that he “silently gave $100 million of his proceeds from the Matrix trilogy to the costume and special effects teams.”  That is [completely untrue. ](https://uproxx.com/movies/did-keanu-reeves-really-give-away-80-million-dollars/) 
Calling it now, Keanu Reeves will fix global warming
“Gotta have opposites, light and dark and dark and light, in painting. It’s like in life. Gotta have a little sadness once in awhile so you know when the good times come. I'm waiting on the good times now.”  ― Bob Ross
On the latest Preet podcast he had Michael Lewis on and they talked about people who are self-possessed.  Keanu is one such individual. He marches to the beat of his own drum regardless of what people think, and his actions make clear that he is not doing this sort of thing for recognition. He does it because of his deeply ingrained sense of what the right thing to do is.  The world needs more people like him.
Very true. How can you appreciate the happy times when there aren't bad times to compare? Also, going through rough times helps with being able to empathize with others.
He’s the real life equivalent of Bruce Wayne 
He's just following Rufus' advice.
Wouldn't attaching his name help promotion ...and encourage donations?
While these days a lot of celebrities face harrasement and assault allegations, Keanu Reeves is just hit with allegations that he may have been Jesus Christ all along.
I heard Ted Danson is Anonymous!
And a very understated guy. Working for 30+ years and just seems to enjoy the work and not the attention or spotlight   And a damn good actor too
Every story I hear about him makes me respect him more. Dude genuinely introduces himself to coffee runners on movie sets and remembers their names. He buys gifts for everyone working on his movies. All the pain in his life and he channeled it into being a mensch.
At this point, we could find out he’s actually the demon from paranormal activity, and we’d all be like, yea, but he’s also John wick, and he donates millions of dollars to help sick kids... so he gets a pass on tormenting that one stupid family.
At this point, I'm willing to forgive Keanu one free murder.
>Keanu...secretly...children  Oh fuck.  *goes back and rereads*  Alright cool.
That's a really long way of saying your a redditor.
I thought I was in KBA and was confused by everyone who thought it might be a negative headline about Immortal Saint Keanu.
Generic nobody u/Oak987 doesn’t think adjectives are useful.
you do realize mother theresa was a horrible person don't you ?  between making the poor and sick suffer unnecessarily, to hording millions in donations and not spending shit with the poor she was more of a public stunt for the catholic church then a really nice person
I love that Gates has given away so much money that he slipped down the wealthiest persons list.
"""Hollywood superstar""  Eh.  ""Keanu Reeves""  Ooh!  ""Has secretly been""   Oh nononono that's not fair  ""Financing children's hospitals""  :)"
My first thought was that he'd died... It was a sad moment.   Phew indeed. 
One time, Keanu Reeves waited a whole 5 seconds to give up his seat for an elderly lady. 
I love that he consistently lives up to expectations. We need genuinely good people in high-profile positions like his to be a beacon of hope and a positive role model. He's doing the work so many choose not to, not because they can't, but because it's easier not to.
> I'm waiting on the good times now.  who started chopping onions in here!?
I wish we were all excellent to each other. 
I would bet that he makes calls to donors and helps with fundraising.  He just doesn't call it the KEANU REEVES FOUNDATION and talk about it on the talk show circuit to pat himself on the back.
I'm not a gun person, but I appreciate the idea of a modern Christ being able to *fucking shred* a course the way Keanu does.
Honestly, I'd settle for a quick nod and the briefest of eyecontact, I'd even be okay with a nod meant for the person behind me.
I sort of agree with some of the criticisms against his emoting/delivery in a few of his roles, but his physical acting is amazing to me. His demeanor, gait, whatever you want to call it is always perfect in his movies.
I've never found his acting better than okay at best, but the dedication he puts into action, stunts, and choreography makes him one of the most believable action movie stars ever in my book.

His daughter was stillborn, caused him and his girlfriend to split. She died in a car crash two years later. 
His dad left when he was 3 and eventually lost touch with him. He has dyslexia and struggled through school, leaving without a diploma. He taught himself to read though. He was friends with River Phoenix. He met and dated Jennifer Syme who became pregnant but the child was stillborn at 8 months. They split up and she ended up in a car crash a year or so later and died.

We still can be yo. 
He could start ending his tweets # Idonate # keepingmanyhospitalsrunning #whatthefuckyoudo # moneybitches. Very classy new age subtle. 
If it's worth doing, it's worth doing well   And Jesus does not half-ass stuff. He didn't just throw some of the merchants out of the temple, he whipped them all out.   He didn't just curse the fig tree for a year, he cursed it for as long as it lived.   Jesus also needs to be able to do some self defense since he is gonna get tons of fanatics from all religions trying to get him in order to prove their devotedness to god or something...
That's why he was the perfect choice for Neo. It's like the role he was born to play.
Shot his dog :(
Don't forget about his sister Kim. Keanu became her caretaker when she was diagnosed with leukemia. The treatment lasted 10 long years and I can't imagine how close they are now.
In my experience it’s people that have tragedy in their life, or even just really difficult patches, that end up being the most compassionate. They make it a point to be kind to people because they know that anyone at any time could be going through hardship, and don’t want to add to it, and want to do everything they can to alleviate it even for a bit.

And all of us buying it are guilty to some extent.
Part of Amazon, Co.? Or .. I guess I'm still confused.. Are they part of Amazon or part of the Amazon.
"Or just having an ""accidental"" forest fire  ""Oops, well I guess that area is no longer part of the forest"""
And there's unfortunately not alot of ways for the average person not to buy oil. Even if we switch to electric cars, so many other things are manufactured or produced using oil.
Random tribe facts: http://www.shiripunoresearch.org/waoraniPeople.html  >Waorani families practiced endogamy, especially cross-cousin marriages — a woman may marry her cousin(s) from one or more sisters on her father's side, or from brother(s) on her mother's side (and necessarily vice-versa with regard to females and their marriage choices). The men may also have multiple wives. Sometimes, a man would kill another man to gain another wife; this was traditionally common if a man had no available cousin to marry.  Husbands and wives often enjoy spontaneous sex, due to their nudity. Huaorani women remove all their body hair by first rubbing ash in the areas where they do not want hair – supposedly to reduce the pain – then pull out the hair.  Probably not where I get packages from
Making electric the main car in a huge nation like the US would make a huge fucking dent in the market though.  Edit: so I never even knew car consumer gas stations only counted for less than 10% of the market, but the change would still be pretty damn great. Imagine having clean air in Los Angeles, motor city, or any other high traffic commuter city. That would be really fucking rad.
Well, shit, I'm convinced.  No steps that *approach* a solution to the problem are worthwhile unless the problem is solved with a single one, so we might as well not even try!  On that note, did you know if you shower, you *just get dirty again eventually*?  And when you put in a day's work you can't retire the next?  I've got some great ideas as to where else we can eliminate unnecessary piecemeal steps that don't really instantly solve other problems in our lives!
Why eat, I'll just be hungry later  and will just end up pooping it out anyway  Edit: i'll be THAT person, coinage appreciated
Imagine finding it the day after it expired...  Edit: Thank you for gold!! :)
Basically the same thing as the $10 bill you find in your winter coat that you haven't worn since last February 
>68-year old Jimmie Smith... chose to receive his payments over the course of 26 years.  WHYYYYYYYYYY!?!?!?!?!
I once found a meatball in my old shirt that was only two days expired. Still ate it
Lucky guy! He should play the... oh. 
Man I found five bucks in a pair of jeans the other day and thaught I was the shit, I can't even fathom how'd I feel if I found 24 million dollars while making out with my ex. 
Friday the 13th is malfunctioning 
"I once was getting calls from someone who sounded like a telemarketer/scammer who I screened (""Call back at blah blah..."").  I finally picked it up just to see why they were so insistent and the woman said I'd entered an online contest for a vacation and I had won.  This was her last attempt to contact me.  It was totally legit, a rafting trip for 2 in Colorado for a week, car included (I think we had to pay airfare).  We ended up having a great time."
Once I took my battery in to be replaced to find out it happened to be the last day it was under warranty, so I've got that going for me.
Gave me anxiety just reading this. 
Great!  Can I have it back please?  (i'm a nice guy,  I'll split it 50/50)
"If it was my shirt itt would have been washed and the numbers barely descernable and it would have expired two days prior. My world of woe. I wish him well and urge him to see the you tube video of ""10 things to do when you win the lottery."""
$24 million sounds like such a fantasy to me. I'm down to eating ramen and peanut butter straight from the jar. 
I've had a lot of very small regrets in life.  I can only imagine how much sleep I would lose over that.
No joke- I used to work with a guy that won $1.1M. He could never find the ticket. 2 weeks after it expired, he found it in his heavy winter coat. (It's Texas- you use them like once a year) I felt terrible for him. His wife divorced him within a month afterwards. I have always wondered- how did he NOT find that? If I had a ticket like that laying around, you better believe I woudl have looked in/on everything I own. That would BE my full time job until I found it......
I can speak from experience on this one. This happened about 6-7 years when McDonald's does their monopoly game. I had collected the boardwalk game piece. I was desperately trying to get the park place piece for the $1,000,000 prize. I ended up posting on Facebook saying I would split the prize with someone if they had it. This guy I knew came up to me 2 days after the event expired and showed me his park place piece. I was so furious, and am still bitter about it to this day. So I know that feeling.  Edit: Went and found the post that I made. I had the park place piece and was looking for the boardwalk one.
An old man turned 98. He won the lottery and died the next day.
Knowing you had it but it's gone would be crushing.   There was a guy who used 10k bitcoin to buy two pizzas in 2010. In today's value that's worth 58 million dollars. 
Basically.
more or less
He has 12 grandchildren. He's most likely thinking about securing their futures in a more sensible way
maybe he is smart enough to know the statistic that nearly all lottery winners go bankrupt within 10 years and taking the annuity will help him to curb his spending? 
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
[Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/570/)
I read a story about some guy who bought bitcoin back in like 2010 that’s worth 7.1 million today. He trashed his laptop with the Bitcoin and he lost a lot of sleep
Damn this thread is giving me anxiety just thinking about these situations
I once lost my wallet on vacation. No big deal. Only about $50 in it and cards I could replace. Fast forward a year. I had lost my job and in that depressing mode where you feel like every dollar you spend could be your last. I look in my vacation toiletry bag. There was the wallet. At the time, going out on a $50 date felt like a million. 
There are few things in life that didn't happen as much as this story did not happen.  $50 worth of hashbrowns gets you no fewer than 6 Park Place pieces.
I think he’s very aware of the potential negative implications, and that’s why he chose to receive his payments over the course of 26 years. Even though he’s 68. 
My old millionaire boss looked homeless half the time, he wanted to see people's true colors shine when interacting with them.   Him looking homeless says nothing about how his family interacts. Maybe he had their futures in mind
Basically
> He's most likely thinking about securing their futures in a more sensible way  WHYYYYYYYYYY!?!?!?!?!
Trust the lottery to still have the money 26 years later to pay you or your family? Thats a lot of faith. 
But not smart enough to know the statistic that most humans don't live far beyond 78?
Assuming he ate one bit every year for the next 24 years. You get more meatball that way. 
I also read that story. The guy bought a bunch to buy mp3s, used a few and never got round to using the others.  At least, that's what he said. If I've learnt anything about Reddit, it's not to believe anything you read on here.
"I sold 14,000 bitcoins mined off 40 or so chassis (read: breadboards) of GPU's for $28,000  At the time the price had bottomed out and Bitcoin looked like it was dying. Made the best decision I could with the info I had at the time and recouped the cost of the gear we had purchased. I kept 10 just on the off chance something crazy would happen like them going to 10k each.   That account is worth $55,000 as of this morning.  What I'm trying to say is, regret is for chumps! Look forward and be at peace with the decisions you've made knowing that hindsight is always 20/20 and a new opportunity is always around the corner  proof: [https://i.imgur.com/3Byexs7.png](https://i.imgur.com/3Byexs7.png)  edit: I should also mention that pretty much every bitcoin user who traded in any ""large"" amounts of coins back then could claim this kinda story (if they stopped mining/hoarding like we did at any point). It's like saying, ""if I had only purchased a shitload of Apple stock back when Microsoft owned the world!"" or ""if I had only bet everything I own on black 26 that time it came up on roulette""  edit2: just to recap, from my point of view I woke up this morning with $55,000 I never expected to get. hell of a good morning :)"
Yeah, that's not how it works.  Who is to say they wouldn't have sold at $100, or $500?
Maybe he lost his private keys because they were stored on his laptop but he didn't lose his bitcoin because his laptop got trashed. The coins are still stored on the blockchain.  A worse one is the guy who bought 2 pizzas using 10,000 BTC in 2010.  I really hope those pizzas were worth the $55 million that BTC would fetch now!
Just don't buy lottery tickets and you're golden. 
He was one of those people that picked the same numbers all the time.
Life is a gamble. I would enjoy the fact that I ate 58 million dollars of pizza.  
That's still a lot of money per year.  $24M, broadly assuming half of that is taxed, so $12M over 26 years, that's about $460k per year.  He's still going to be torn to shreds by his own family, especially since they know if he runs out in any given year, they can just wait till the next year for another $460k.
He doesn’t. People are just judgmental and shallow
He took the five dollars from his ex's jeans while they were making out
If you can't trust random, anonymous people on the internet, who *can* you trust?
Honestly if I came into that kind of money, I'd drop contact with my family the second they ask for more money (I'd give them a piece since they're gonna feel they deserve it). 
Why
that's such a weird and random joke
"We can't bust heads like we used to. But we have our ways. Like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for m'shoe. So I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. ""Gimme five bees for a quarter,"" you'd say. Now where were we... oh yeah. The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. I didn't have any white onions, because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones..."
The odds that those numbers will be chosen again are exactly the same as the odds that any other number would be chosen. 
Or just don't tell your family (or anyone) you won in the first place. Hire a lawyer to handle everything for you since legally they're not allowed to tell anyone else either (client-attorney privilege).
Speak up I can't hear you. 
You misunderstand. One bitcoin is worth 5.5k right now. In 2009 you could have purchased several thousand bitcoins for $100.
Which is unlikely
In america you have to publically claim the lottery winnings. It keeps the lottery people from giving the winning tickets to their friends/family and not tell anyone.
My friend got like 30k from his mom's life insurance and the vultures came from everywhere. I kept telling him to tell them to do what they would do for their financial woes if he didn't have that money but he always caved. I'm uh.. not sure how much he had left when he died from cancer like 2 years later :/ life is stupid sometimes.
I encourage you to read up on winners of large lotteries. The statistics alone are horrifying.
And I just got a bit more sad lol 
No, it's on a state-by-state basis. [Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, N Dakota, Ohio, and S Carolina](http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/01/15/in-colorado-and-other-states-lottery-winners-can-keep-names-secret/) allow you to claim anonymously, and other states like Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont allow you to claim it via a trust. A couple other states like Illinois and Oregon allow you to claim anonymously if there's a high risk of harm to the winner.
Hey it’s me, your entity!
In france when someone wins the lottery they can choose to be anonymous,  tax are on tickets only,  so you dont have that 50℅ cut.   And they then do courses for winners on finance and how to learn the various instruments and who to call,  then they get called from time to time to see how they are psychologically  doing.  They will give you the contact informations of other winners if they both want,  so they organize dinners together,  its very useful for those that were very poor to be around people like them.    Edit: https://youtu.be/RQ2Sp-oZTnI  This is a documentary on the lady that gives you the money and does the follow up and organizes the lessons for winners.  It's in french tho. 
Especially if they have 12 grandkids!
I was looking for you! Unfortunately I still haven't won the lottery so keep in touch. 
She's done it too a few bridges as well not just this one, a couple in Newcastle as well!
That’s terrific. I used to do the same, about a decade ago now, except I’d leave post-it notes in public restrooms around New York. I hope they helped at least one person. 
Good to see Sunderland in the news.  Unfortunately, in neighbouring Newcastle (where she has also 'tagged'), there was someone on the edge last night (21:00ish), as well as another one this morning (08:00ish).  Hopefully both were okay.  Edit 08:45 - so just got in from work.  Three police cars on the Tyne Bridge this morning (08:00).  What on earth is going on???  Edit 21:30 - No police on the bridge tonight.
Took a pic of one of these the other day. https://i.imgur.com/N2caovA.jpg Was around 50 all with unique messages.
I would do the same but I'm afraid of high places
What a lovely thing to do. Such a small action, yet such a large effect it has had.
"Good for her. She's clearly smarter than me. If I tried I would mistakenly write ""you can do it"" "
"This is my home city!  (not really relevant: ) After reading the headline I was thinking to myself ""I've seen something like that"" and then opened the post to see the thumbnail of Wearmouth Bridge. First time I've seen Sunderland outside of local subs. (End of tangent)  The things they say are very sweet indeed! I think a friend I was with at the time too a picture of one of the more impacting ones, I'll see if I can find it. Although I think I recall that one was ripped down (towards the southside/cityside) which is honestly upsetting.  I had assumed this was done by samaritans or another volunteer/charity group as their number is plastered all over the bridge; to know that this was done by 1 girl is amazing. It speaks to independence and courage, like the opposite of 'safety in numbers' and she was against that.   Edit: Typo 'speaks to'"
That's truly wonderful!
In America the headline would be “bridge vandal caught and arrested”  “We know she was trying to help, but the rules are the rules”
"Same, usually wrote 'call 0687-25772 for a good time <3"""
I seen the guy on the edge this morning on my way to work. The police had a lane closed off while a few of them were trying to calm him down from a distance. He seemed quite angry and totally unnerved by where he was standing. The police looked like they had it under control though, hopefully they did.
What do the numbers represent?
That’s a really good one.  Hopefully she doesn’t post her B material on bridges.  I could see a suicider reading a just okay one and going “Eh” and jumping.  
Ok... I'm suffering from major depression, and there's some seriously funny stuff right there. Not sure why but the sheer contrast is something of unique beauty LOLOL
Not me. I’m afraid of widths. 
It's really great to think something so small can have a large impact on someone's life.
And posted that she was “doing her bit” and was proud of her skills but then after she got called out by hundreds of people she pretended she hadn’t done it. 
https://i.imgur.com/0MyGI.jpg
Aye, when I drove past, it looked like his friends/family were with him and the police were further away. Fingers crossed everything was fine. 
Googled it: https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help-you/samaritans-free-call-helpline-number-faqs
It's a phone number for Samaritans, a charity that helps with mental health issues.
This is more likely to stop me then some basic statement.
I am afraid of handwritten notes. :(
I think she’s preventing large impacts on people’s lives. 
"There was a comic similar to this, but it ends in tragedy and the guy says something like ""You should have never called, you should have never called me for a good time!""  It's my white whale of the internet."
Fucking hell.  No one will even show up when I'm up there. Fuck me.

Draw it for yourself then post it on reddit and wait until someone calls you out for copying it and posts the original you're looking for about halfway down the comment page.
I’ll come. 
From Canada, I wouldn't be able to travel to the UK, but any time you want to talk, chat or just play some games... send me a message.  You matter :)
No joke if you told me you were gonna do it I would book the next flight from San Francisco for you. Say the word and I’m there.
I think it helps to talk about those dark things. When you keep it 100% inside, you sort of lose perspective. Talking it out helps you process, I think. It brings it into the real world rather than just letting it fester in your warped inner thoughts.
Well. They were definitely very accurate in that statement..
That’s genius, I actually will do that!  Edit: I’ve never felt so much pressure before. Thanks !remindme
Me too.
Before a hurricane would hit in Florida, if people were planning on staying the police would go to their door and ask them to either tattoo or sharpie their name and information on their arm so rescue workers can identify their body.   It helped convince a lot of people to evacuate
Unlike the people in question, who usually aren't very accurate and just impact a general area.  Edit: In all seriousness though, this girl is awesome. It doesn't always seem like it, but we can make a difference as individuals in our lives and the lives of those around us.
I'll also be there. 
Oh oh. I'll bring the snacks!
This is shaping up to a decent orgy
People are such garbage to bully someone doing something good.
*Unfortunately, she felt her school did not support her and she says she was disappointed when the headteacher suggested she give up litter picking to ease off the bullies.*  This is really the most saddening part of the whole story though. Shame on the headteacher, they're supposed to support these kinds of actions, not stint them.
The award also marks the first time in a while that someone has accepted something offered by the Prime Minister.
"*Nadia Sparkes, from Norfolk, refused to let the taunts deter her from litter-picking on her way to and from school.*  *After her story went viral she became an ambassador for the wildlife charity WWF, and now has more than 4,000 followers on social media.*  *Nadia said she was ""really pleased"" to see her efforts make a difference.*  *Since starting her crusade, the teenager has collected more than 1,100 litres of rubbish - enough to fill about 40 kitchen bins.*  She now has worldwide support on social media and has proudly accepted the title of ""Trash Girl.""   [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-46472284)"
What fucking kind of reprehensible anus cockroach bullies someone ~~for picking up litter~~?
Well, the plan was for it to be awarded on Friday, but I think it'll be delayed. They're not sure of the length of the delay yet, but they're working to deliver the award as soon as possible. Apparently if the delay is too long, there will be another vote and the award might never happen.
I can't believe this is true, nobody in England has ever referred to rubbish as trash, her name would be 'rubbish girl'.
A 13 year old girl was catching flak for actively making a difference in her community? Really?  Seriously, what the hell is the matter with people?
She should have collected them on her way to school.
I have a lot of faith in the younger generation taking care of this earth better than the older generation. This is sad to read.
That was the advice we all got in my school in England. If you're bullied don't do whatever gets you bullied. Any attempt to stop the bullies by the teachers made them worse.  Britain is broken culturally. No respect, no values at all levels of society really.
The girl is used to dealing with trash though.
She just placed herself into the sights of many great educators and work force leaders. Good on her!!  Meanwhile, I am honestly also a little extra mindful about commenting. The bullies are probably around the same age as her, and I rather hope the bullies will use this news for the better, to drive for change and more positivity instead of interpreting for the worse with sour grapes/opposite extremist attitude for years to come.  It's still bullying and it's not right, but I can see why some kids didn't know better and thought making fun of her was OK.  I've seen enough adults don't pick up their own trash; there just aren't enough positive role models to go around sometimes.  Go easy on the kids.
I'm not entirely sure but I think you might have just answered your own question
Yea what is wrong with kids these days? Calling her trash girl for picking up litter? It should be rubbish girl or bin bitch. What a disgrace.
It says a lot about our society though. Cleaning after yourself, and especially after other people is perceived as something lame, and not as something that's our responsibility
Aw, I wanted to say that.
"""bin bitch"" that's a good one. The bullies will have to remember that."
"I was walking with my brother once and he just dropped his cup (one of those big fast food ones) in the street once he'd finished his drink. When I went back to get it after unsuccessfully telling him to do it, he thought I was weird. It really pissed me off. He's actually quite a philosophically-inclined and introspective person, so I was really shocked he'd do something that lazy and self-centered just because he didn't care enough to carry his stuff for another two minutes until we got to a bin. His defeatist mentality of ""Eh, environment's already fucked my litter doesn't matter."" is all too common."
Just talked to a guy today on Facebook about how he thinks climate change is a hoax. I simply just asked him what is wrong with wanting to ensure our children have a healthy planet to live on. A place where water is clean and not soaked with pollutants.   His response: John Kerry created global warming nonsense and democrats just want to tax you more into slavery.    I seriously hate these fucking people with a passion and are a legitimate threat to humanity.
Kids are never happy with their parents generation, no matter the time period. What the internet gave us, however, is a way to organize.
My mother would always teach me by making me feel like a guilty piece of shit.  “That cup you just dropped - what if a little animal goes in and gets its little head stuck in there, like a hedgehog? What happens when that cup breaks apart into small pieces and a little bird eats a piece thinking it’s food, and suffers for days in agony as it’s insides get blocked up?   It might not seem like a big deal to you, but at the very worst you can cause untold suffering to some completely helpless creatures - at best, you’re expecting someone else to have to pick up after you, and what makes you think you have the right to make extra work for someone else just because you’re being bloody lazy? I thought I raised you better than that. Shame on you.”  And she would always be right. Who the hell am I to endanger other living beings and make more work for somebody else? So when I see people being so blatantly inconsiderate I could genuinely throttle them with a dirty shoelace.
I hate that mentality. Just because people treat their area like trash doesn't mean you have to. I was always taught to leave the place cleaner than when we arrived, and it doesn't take much just to keep your stuff until a trash can is nearby.
it's a shit mentality. i almost always try to follow 'leave a place the same or better than you found it'.
Agreed. The internet gives us access to so many sources for information previous generations simply didn't have. Teenagers wouldn't have much reason to look at world events beyond what's reported on the news, but now they can learn about entire revolutions taking place just by checking their Facebook feed. They're able to actually research stuff instead of having to blindly trust whatever adults tell them.  It's amazing how much the internet is shaping this generation. I don't think some people in the older generations realize just how powerful it really is.
*“In addition, we are waiving change fees for customers who want to change their flight plans due to the forecast.” the  spokesman said. “We also are adding flights and increasing the size of the aircraft we’re using on flights to and from San Juan and south Florida, providing more opportunities for customers to leave. New flights are being added to and from San Juan, Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Key West, all to Atlanta (where people can connect to destinations across the U.S.)*  Now that's a good PR move.
Good job, Jet Blue. That's how you build goodwill and loyalty.
But the uber ride to the airport is $1000.
Shit... for airfare that low I might just fly into Florida lol  EDIT: don't worry guys I understand the headline I'm just joking lol
They are going to get competitive after the storm for people to return.  
"Where?? Where are these $99 flights??? I am in FL trying desperately to get out. I have selected every airport I can think of within driving distance and am willing to go to just about any major city on the Eastern seaboard. So I ask, where are they? It is me, my spouse, and two small children. Fort Lauderdale to WA D.C.? Sold out. To Boston? Sold out. From Orlando, a short three hour drive? Sold out. Where are these tickets??  Edit: RIP my inbox. The generosity of people on here always surprises me. My post was meant to convey that despite what is being reported about the JetBlue fares, they don't seem to exist. For reasons difficult to explain, my options are fly my family out or hunker down here. I would have much preferred fly out, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards. I cannot believe how many of you responded with offers of a free place to stay or points to use at a hotel. Other than a couple of random people writing things like ""you're just looking for handouts,"" most of the messages I got were for offers of help. Thank you so much for restoring my faith in humanity. I have the means to pay for a hotel, but thank you so very much to all who offered a lending hand. "
In other news, there is a massive shortage of JetBlue flights out of Florida. 
My family and I were stuck in Turks and Caicos trying desperately to get a flight out but they were all sold out. JetBlue added more flights on airbuses and we managed to get out of there on time. They're being super great about this whole situation.
This morning jetblue flights were going for $550+. Sounds like they saw the bad PR coming and decided to get ahead of it. That being said, they are my favorite US-based airline and hopefully this helps people evacuate.
"Related: NPR had an interesting commentary on price gouging as an economically efficient strategy for emergencies.    -  2 economists argued that it causes people to evaluate what they really need and they use it as a scarce resource rather than wasting/hoarding.    -  It also causes more of that resource to come in from other locations in the country since they can get more money for it when the price is jacked up.  - Ultimately there will be more for everyone if prices accurately reflect the supply/demand price curve.  Then a 3rd economists comes on and is like ""yeah that's all great except you REALLY piss people off and they won't forget when things return to normal."""
What's the price to go into Florida? The beaches will be clear for another few days at least 
Jetblue has a pilot training center and a huge base in Orlando. They have to evacuate their planes. It's called a ferry flight. They're selling seats on planes that would fly out empty anyway. This isn't goodwill, this is pure economics sold as goodwill.
Not sure why this is hard to understand for some companies/people/entities. Instead of turning people away or making it difficult in already difficult situations they do good by the people and the people usually return that favor down the line. Very good move indeed! 
>and increasing the size of the aircraft we’re using  For some hilarious reason the first image that came to mind was the pilot blowing into a little tube on the side of the airplane to inflate it bigger.
Its just good humanity. Somebody in charge over there is actually a good human being. 
JetBlue has a history of strong customer relations. They actually managed to turn a profit in the months after 9/11 because they were small and well-liked.   Back in the day they were the only airline with satellite TV, which was a big perk to my family back when we'd go to Disney with small kids frequently.
Proud to say my father is a JetBlue pilot :) he just got home from a 10 day trip today. We evacuate this weekend. 
/r/dadjokes needs you back urgently.
shit you could probably run to the airport and get there before your flight
....because he's/she's risking their life to uber your ass to the airport instead of boading a flight themselves.
You could get a roundtrip ticket and just go to the Winchester until this blows over!
"Then cancel the trip mid-flight ... ""EVERYBODY OUT!"""
Stop being facetious - after all the bad PR I'm sure they've instructed their employees to never beat anyone again.   They'll surely move on to sexual assault.
Not if you schedule a [round trip...](http://i.imgur.com/FuBdKwy.png)

Do you have a vehicle to drive your family out of harms way? If so, I have saved some Marriott points from traveling for work. Would be happy to help you afford a room for a bit if you have no other options. Not sure if money is the concern, just throwing it out there.
I really doubt somebody goes in and manually sets those prices for every flight. They probably have an algorithm that detected a surge of ticket purchases and started increasing the fares automatically. 
Chris christie could get a beach to himself again!
Well it's still a decent thing to do. They could just focus on leaving as fast as possible and ensure the safety of their planes. Instead they're doing something decent while still making profit. I'd consider that a win-win-win. They're getting their planes and employees out, they're making money and performing a humanitarian duty that will get them good PR.
Plus, if their prices are lower with bigger aircraft then they'll probably pull in more people, people who will remember who helped them and probably factor that into their travel decisions down the line. Now if only more companies realized that being good to your customer base is beneficial.
When my grandma died and I missed my flight out of Dubai back to the states due to incoming fire in Baghdad AA put me on the next flight out in first class. I was super stressed I would miss the funeral and they came through for me and now have a customer for life. They might not always be the best airline but they were bros in a stressful time and I can respect that.

Jet blue has been the best flights I've ever had. Hands down!! All the amenities. 
Do you know the reason why they wanted to put TV's in every headrest?  Kids.  David Neeleman knew that if he could keep kids entertained for the duration of a flight, everyone else on the plane would be much happier.  Genius.  
Hi I'm Urgently, did someone call?
Hey now, I fly from Europe to Asia a lot and air Malaysia is fucking awesome. Who gives you cheap flights, the company who has lost 2 planes in quick succession that's who. Who gives you extra leg room because less people take their flights? The company who has lost 2 planes in quick succession. Which company has the nicest staff and cleanest planes? The mother fucking  company who has lost 2 planes in quick succession after one's pilot got a little sad and the other got shot down. THAT'S WHO. Best airline in the world.

Spoken like someone that isn't trapped in the path of a Cat 5 natural disaster.
That's absolutely what happened and it's frustrating to see so many so quick to spew hate and assume things.
Just ask Mattress Mac of Houston! That guy got so much good publicity! 
Or just pull in enough people they make a fuckload of money selling food and stuff anyways 
Have they ever had catastrophies yet?
/r/dadjokes needs you too  
Haha, this guy is being funny.  *looks out the window*  Fuck. 
Always heard of him through the years in Houston, though never was a customer.  Now, because of what he did, I won't be buying mattresses anywhere else.
I may never go to Texas, but Mattress Mack being a good dude is one of the things that stuck with me from the Harvey coverage, and there's a pretty good chance I'll randomly mention it sometime down the line, and 100% would if mattresses and Houston ever came up at the same time. That's some extreme market penetration for a local mattress store!
selling... food... Have you been on an airplane?
No. I was in Iraq when she died in Minnesota. Everyone transits through Dubai to get back to the states.
No.
A great endorsement from /u/pm_me_your_teen_tits
Hi I'm Too, did someone ring
"I think you mean, ""Fllubllhbhk"" "
"Lol ""why buy a mattress aaaanywhere else"" "
Who now?
Local Mattress / furniture tycoon in Houston. He opened his stores as shelters to a ton of people. They made great shelters because they're huge a filled with comfortable furniture.
Well shit.  I'm sold.
/r/dadjokes needs you as well.
Is this a quote from his commercials? Because it sounds like Ants-in-my-eyes Johnson or the guy that sells Real Fake Doors.
Matress Mack is someone in Houston who owns a massive furniture store, he spent days during the flood using the store's trucks to drive through high water and rescue people. He opened his furniture store to people who lost their homes and allowed people to sleep on sofas/beds in the store.

*flight attendant approaches you*  hi can i get a double cheeseburger no pickles
I feel as if it's jinxed now 
I'm As Well, did someone buzz?
Its part of Sleep Country Canadas commercials.
And in return he has customers for life. 
We have a Mattress Mick here in Dublin! Mick donated a bunch of mattresses to a homeless shelter that was being set up for families not too long ago. He's a bit of an icon in Dublin because he's pretty eccentric. 
"omg he also gave away $7 million dollars worth of furniture in 2014 by making a bet that the broncos would beat the seahawks. he said ""i don't think of it as a loss for the gallery, i think of it as a win for my customers."" what a solid dude."
"He came from nothing. He was driving to Dallas to buy furniture which he sold in an old model home park from some company that failed. He got burned by the DEA(or some other agency) for money laundering because the DEA were the only ones that would lend him money. He did community service and did an amazing above and beyond to steer at risk individuals to a better path. All the time selling furniture that really did ""save you money!"" "" Buy it today get it delivered tonight"" really happened with independent contractor drivers making a great living wage. It wasn't free delivery but it was super inexpensive by contract guys that went above and beyond too.  He hasn't abandoned anyone that is following in his footsteps. He is that really hard boss that you would work for again. I didn't, but I would. "
It's ok, I got this. I'm not superstitious so the jinx won't take.
Fuck it, you can come as well.
"""mattressss so comfortable you can sleep on em through a hurricane!"" "
Doesn't matter what the motivation  was, the fact is he did it when he didn't have to and that alone is worth praise. 
not to mention a lot of people need new mattresses.   I love it when doing the right thing aligns with good business sense. 
I'm not superstitious but I am a little stitious. 
That's Mr. As Well, show some respect.
Sofa so nice it saved grandma's life.
And he did it before the church could.  Amazing times we live in

If you have a vulnerable router, it's a race between this dude and lots and lots of bad guys. Every IP on the internet is being constantly scanned by bad guys. Don't wait for your white night.

Who is this 4Chan and what does he want?
About six-months ago I got an email from a stranger. Apparently, he had written a script that goes through Github public repos looking for email/pw combos. Sure enough, in one of my first projects years earlier, I hadn't ignored the .env file and my email/pw were right there for the public. Not only were they both still valid, but the pw was (foolishly) the same one I use for my bank login etc...  Since changed them all, but that guy could have really fucked up my life if he wanted.
Using evil skills for good. Truly awesome. The hero we need but don’t deserve. 
Haha I used to do something like that in the early 2000s I'd go wardriving looking for open networks with default router configs and rename the networks to lock your shit or hacked to scare people into locking their shit down it usually worked too I'd come back around and find the formerly open networks secured. It was so ghetto too I mounted a Wi-Fi adapter in a metal vegatable can I cut and turned into a funnel shape, added a handle and mounted an led Dragon head to the top and used it like a radar gun (no idea how well it really worked) pointing at houses and checking networks as we drove around.
I like to live my life by WWMD (what would Minsc \[and his giant miniature space hamster\] do.)

Gray hat is a term to describe morally ambigious hackers  Although this can be classified as white hat imo  Edit: guys you are overthinking this, there are enough confusing terms as it is   This is gray hat, not beige, off-white or any other discolouration of black/white you can think of.   
I'm kind of surprised this is necessary, a lot of major software companies pay bounties for exploits
I don't know how I'd feel about it.  1) How do I know he actually fixed it and didn't exploit me.  2) If he did fix it. How do I know he fixed it properly? How do I file a customer complaint against a hacker.  I feel like I'd be so confused and afraid at that point I'd just buy a new router.
I hope they confirmed that I was wearing underwear or that at least my junk was properly tucked first.
Ahem *knight
The router programmers definitely should have not even put this variable in their software wtf.

But they just said he has a grey hat...
That is actually the mindset of most hackers. Sometimes they notify the person afterwards, then get sued and end up in jail. 
When I was like 5-8 THIS was my dream job.

A little tacky, but I see it more of a donation. The work is already done. They don’t have to pay him but if they feel like it they have the option.
White hat would be someone hired by a company or person to hack into their own system to find issues, what this person is doing is illegal but doing it for good thus grey hat. 
The manufacturer released a patch quickly, but users, both private individuals and companies, haven't been very diligent in updating.
But... if you're the kind of person who knows to ask those questions, your router probably wasn't vulnerable enough for him to target.
But then you'd be vulnerable again until he fixes the new router.

Restrict administrative access/login to the local network.  Use a strong password for the administrative access account.  Use a strong password or key for the wireless network.  Restrict Mac addresses to known devices or only grant internal IPs to known devices.  Hide the SSID for your wireless network.  If you are really adventurous, configure firewall rules as specifically needed for devices on your network with a catch all deny all rule.   —  All of these things will make actual non-normal use of your network a pain in the ass. Friend wants to hop onto your network? Pain in the ass. Want to add a new device? Pain in the ass.  Ease of use is usually the victim of security in network settings.  EDIT: To everyone saying MAC filtering and SSID broadcast prevention are ineffective they are effective at preventing unsophisticated attackers.

*“I’m doing something to protect the world they also live in. It’s everyone’s job. We are all responsible for keeping this world safe, instead of believing that it’s always someone else’s job,”  Nadia said about the bullies.*  Good on her for continuing to make the world a better place.

Dude they called her ‘trash girl’ kids can be so messed up and unimaginative.   They could’ve called her ‘trashy’  But trash girl just makes a superhero. 
I’m also guilty of picking up recyclables when I go for a walk and bringing them home to my recycling bin on occasion. I prefer to be called *Tree Hugger* as an insult though. 😜

Yeah fuck those bullies, god damn losers

I learned a lot in college from an ex that did this. Some broseph Maximus walking in front of us tossed his Gatorade on the sidewalk, and she mid conversation picked it up and carried it until we walked passed a trash can. No attempt to shame the guy or get props from me, just Day In The Life Of.   I started doing it and I've noticed other people emulate when they see me do it. 
That would require people to stop bitching about how bad everything is and how horrible people are and do something to change things instead, and that just sounds like work.
They will realise later in life how downright awesome Trash Girl is.
Bro. Stop having passion. Just be a mindless numb consumer like the rest of us.

You're not wrong of course, but from another perspective:  - No success criteria except exams which are forced upon you.  - No satisfaction or feeling of value from being given/taking responsibility.  - Friends are more valued when they're a rare commodity.  - Yea that one I can't think of a flipside. 
I used to think that in hs too.   But after college:  * I have a job I love.  * I have disposable income to do whatever the fuck I want.(as long as keep to my budget and pay for fixed expenses first) * I have freedom to do whatever I want whenever I want (until I start settling down) * I still have very little responsibility, just whatever I decide to take on.   I prefer everything about adulthood. There are less petty vain children around, less bullies, and less restrictions. I still see my friends but now we have money to do stuff. Responsibilities of adulthood are just pay your damn bills on time (autopay everything and stick to a budget) and dont die or kill anyone (just use some common sense and don't do dangerous shit)

Having a job you love is already pretty lucky I'd say. 
..and they maintain reasonable prices on their products so people can actually afford to eat well
We have a grocery store near us that is known for paying people a little above market.  They realized long ago that turnover and unhappy employees are more expensive than just treating people well to begin with.  I go there in part because I now recognize everybody there and know they're good at what they do.
The Aldi near me also allows their cashiers to sit down (and has stools at the registers).  They're the only store I've seen do this.  I'm a former cashier and my feet were killing me by the end of the day.
They were a great store growing up poor.  I wish they had one in Vegas...   Edit: RIP inbox.  I love you guys lol
This would easily make me want to shop at Aldi a lot more. I love going to stores like aldi and Lidl above the usual U.S. supermarket chains.
From what I recall Aldi has less employees working at any given time but they have more responsibilities than other supermarkets. The article implied that extra challenges broke up the monotony of the job and gave the employees a better sense of fulfillment.
Gonna try to get a job with them next month actually
It’s the power of the quarter. 
Kudos to them in a time when the high street is dying 
Honestly, Im' all aboard on the aldi's life style. I only go to other stores for the arugula. Aldi's has superior products at rock bottom prices. 
Considering a lot of their produce comes from the EU, I hope they can maintain their low prices if/when Brexit happens.
Of course they can do this. With their prices being so competitive, their stores are always full and with so many cost saving measures like coin operated carts and no free bags they make a lot of money from their realtively small profit per item. I've never seen an employee in an Aldi who wasnt busy so there is no down time where employees arent making them money.
We have Aldi in Iowa, too bad this story doesn't affect US stores, I would be driving the extra distance to support these guys
and the owner of aldi süd was until his death in 2014 the richest man in germany 
Which just shows that all the fucking scumbag corporations could do it, but then the greedy vampiric shareholders would be all over the execs to squeeze out more MONEE out of their shares. We should really have a cap on returns. Or - no dividends unless wages are at least at real living levels.
I went to aldi for the first time the other day I couldn't believe how low some of the basics were I saved mad guap
Wish Kroger would figure that shit out. I watch people come and go at my local, I finally was looking around for a new job myself and found out even some of their skilled positions like deli and fresh food only make 8 or 9 an hour to start. Fucking bullshit. 
Yeah. For YEARS I hear again and again that turnover, training, and quality applicant searching is such an expensive pain in the ass for so many companies, yet there doesn't seem to be much in the way of employee retention anymore. It seems like there could be a lot to be said for making your current workers happy, which companies like Costco already do pretty well apparently, and that actually HELPS the bottom line. Yet Forbes, WSJ, and the other conservative propaganda rags just regurgitate the pro-corporate, anti-poor talking points how an increased minimum wage is bad for everyone. Good to see a company make a point to go against the grain. 
"Ah, a bit of enlightened self interest.  They aren't merely doing something ""nice"", they are also making a shrewd business decision.  Sometimes, the two things are not opposites."
That's probably because aldi is from germany and nobody in their right mind would let a cashier stand at the register there. That sounds ludicrous. What benefit does that have?
What kind of sick fuck would make a cashier stand all day?!?!
This is an aspect of American work life that I've never understood.  It doesn't make you look like you're working harder to the customers.  All it does is wear out the employees quicker and make them irritable, creating more conflict with customers and ultimately decreasing customer service.
Growing up going to Aldi meant a stocked fridge even though we were poor. My mom still goes but nowadays uses Costco a bunch. Both places known for being decent jobs.   It's a good argument against paying your employees as little as you legally can.
My mom fed 6 kids on about $50 a week through Aldi. We literally would not have survived without that store! 
I'm not poor and I still hit up Aldi's once a month. 
I had no idea either were even available in the US
Not sure about the UK but it's like that in Germany. Aldi and Lidl pay better than other supermarkets but the employees always seem very hurried and there's much less staff than in other places. They often have two tasks at the same time like being at the checkout and when there's no customer they rush back to filling up the shelves or cleaning the store. 
Yeah heard it’s a nightmare. They employ fewer staff, so the ones they do have need to do everything and do it quickly. Stock shelves, go on the tills, clean up sick, sort out stock room etc.  Less staff means more work compared to competitors so they’ll need to pay them more to keep them.
It's the German way. In Germany no cashier (at Aldi ) is just a cashier and all Cashiers are educated and trained for at least 2 years to do several tasks beside the cash register.  
You probably already know this, but I'll say it anyway: Ask for the regional manager when turning in your application, and call back a week afterwards. At least where I am, they never call back unless you do. Best of luck!
But what about second Brexit? 
> cost saving measures like coin operated carts and no free bags  I imagine you're from the US. These are just standard practices in European supermarkets, even our higher quality supermarkets have coin operated trolleys and no free bags (it's the law). I guess Aldi just took these practices with them when they moved over.
US Aldi locations still treat their employees with respect and dignity, as well as paying higher than average wages for comparable positions at Walmart (as an example). Aldi is a great place to work according to employees.
That's an aspect of wealth inequality that *really* pisses me off. If the wealthiest people doubled their tax rate, they wouldn't have any appreciable change in lifestyle. They'd still have multiple giant homes all over the world, be able to afford yachts and planes, etc.  And yet they want even more.
The Albrechts also lived very humble. One of the brothers got abducted once and the kidnappers asked him to show his ID because his suit looked so cheap. 
Or, quite simple, make wages directly proportionate to shareholder returns 
funfact, shsreholders arent some mythical cresture. many of them are just 401k or unions of employees. regular old people.
Kroger where I lived was union, too. So people were making $.10 or $.25 over minimum wage,  nearly everyone was kept part time so the company didn't have to contribute to benefits for them, and they had union dues of around $30 deducted from their check every month. 
Costco is another one that does this.  I like going there too.  They've even proved it works at scale.
you gotta consider just how bad the 2008 recession was. College educated people were working minimum wage jobs just to make ends meet. For employers, this meant they could offer entry level wages for positions requiring 5-10 years experience, because the labor market was so unbelievably saturated. This also meant that you didn't have to offer as much in the way of training, and high turnover wasn't as much of an issue because people needed the job security and there was always someone else who was just as desperate to work a low wage job.   Things are changing so hopefully you'll see more in the way of training and efforts at employee retention now that the economy is near full employment. That said, I wouldn't count on it.
There’s that quote circulating about a CFO asking the CEO what if they pay for everyone to be better at their jobs and they all leave. And the CEO asks in return, what if we don’t, and they stay?
Even further, it would run afoul of workers safety regulation in Germany to make somebody stand all day when the job doesn’t require it. If your employees call out sick for weeks with a doctor’s note about back issues the employer has too keep paying full wages up to 6 weeks (so making your employees more sick at work hurts the bottom line) and, if the issues become a pattern that the employer doesn’t address, it faces future health liability lawsuits, which are still expensive to settle due to the high cost of long-term care and accommodation despite the lack of punitive damages in Germany’s Civil Law. That’s on top of possible fines for possible workers safety rule violations.
Sometimes I fantasize about other countries labour laws.
Most retailers in the United States.   Aldi is the only one who lets them sit.
"Unfortunately, in the US most businesses seem to think that if you are able to sit, you aren't working hard enough. I had a job where I had to stand to do some paperwork because if I sat down, I was ""lazy"".  SMDH"
The sick fucks I worked for at a grocery store one summer. I went home everyday with really bad cramps when I worked the register. I got yelled at multiple times for using a few milk crates that were sitting a few feet away as a stool when we weren’t busy.  I had to get really good at hiding my sitting.
We do all of our months shopping on a single day on a single road. $800. Aldis then Costco then sams. Ratio of quantity / price is at least double for aldis.
You don’t have to be poor to appreciate value for your money! I’m not poor (now) and I still shop at Aldi’s because I prefer to get my weekly groceries for $150 instead of $400. 
Fun fact, trader Joes and aldi are sister stores, so you may be in an area where TJ is more prevalent. But yes, aldis are around the US  Edit: apparently that’s not the case in America as I thought it was, but elsewhere
My friend was a manager of one for a while after going over from tesco and he said it was crazy how much harder he had to work. Just because you're the store manager there doesn't make you exempt from pulling your weight stacking shelves and working on the checkouts. 
They don't bag groceries or wrangle carts and they aren't obsessed with making the shelves look perfect, so that saves a lot of time.  They basically have people on the till and stocking shelves.  Their hours are also more limited allowing them to do stocking at stuff outside of shopping hours.  The one by my house seems to run pretty smoothly. 
Nightmare seems like a pretty big exaggeration. I guess for some people it would be. I worked there for about a year, shifts flew by because there was so much to do. But also I was treated with respect and trusted to get many tasks done in a day. I guess if a person wants to just hang out behind a register all day than yeah, it'd be a nightmare
We all know Assistant to the Regional Manager holds the true power 
*Don't think he knows about second Brexit, Pip.*      What about regret? Second referendum? Russian meddling? Ferries? Northern Ireland? He knows about them, doesn't he?       *I wouldn't count on it.*    
I love that they let their checkers sit down. I think it is downright disrespectful to an employee to make the stand all day. Even a stool would be nice. 
>If the wealthiest people doubled their tax rate, they wouldn't have any appreciable change in lifestyle.  You can go WAY higher than that.  Bill Gates increases his worth by $11B a year and can buy basically anything he wants.  If you taxed him at 99% he would still make $110M a year and STILL buy basically anything he wants.
Sounds like they got too known to the point where their plan got busted. Wearing cheap clothing and not sticking out tend to be done to circumvent drawing in unnecessary attention such as kidnappers/burglars!
Not being publicly traded certainly helps here.
Yeah from what I’m learning it’s a union issue. Unsurprising, unions have their place, but they often end up fucking over new hires pretty badly
I hate going to places where I just know the people are underpaid and miserable. Places like Wal-Mart could fix half of that equation and I might consider shopping there more.   I really don't care if I save $3-5 every trip if it means I have to look into the sad eyes of an overworked, underpaid cashier. The 2-3 of them still working since the shift to self-checkout, that is.  edit: their/there
>*College educated people were working minimum wage jobs just to make ends meet.*  White collar jobs don't even pay much above minimum wage anymore because everyone and their mom has a degree.  At my first marketing job, I made $2/h more than I did working at a grocery store.
I'm also reminded of Henry Ford.  The commonly told story is that he wanted his cars to be affordable to the working class (eg. his own staff).  So he both made the car affordable, and paid people reasonably.  But he was also trying to combat turnover, mistakes and burnout (he also reduced the length of the working day).  The productivity gains he made by doing these things allowed them to build cars faster, and make the cars even more affordable (and increase sales volume).  Too many businesses are run like the economy is a zero-sum game, and it's short-sighted.
...you got any more of them german laws to spare to us americans?
"A whisper floating, says softly  *""unionize and protest""*  heard from the distance "
That’s pretty fucked up. Is not like they can perform the job any better standing. 
WE'RE ALL LIVING IN AMERIKA AMERIKA IST WUNDERBAR
American culture is mental 
We go to Aldi's for pantry items, canned goods, etc.  I'm in the Midwest though so meat is cheap here, it's sad that pork prices are starting to go up again, I was enjoying the 89 cents a pound pork shoulders.  $12 feeds the family a nice supper of pulled pork sandwiches, baked potatoes, and some beans and then I have decent lunches for the week.
isnt trader joes aldi nord and the aldi you guys got the aldi süd?
As it should be. I know every time I go to Aldi, no matter how busy or overloaded anyone is, they’re happy to see me, they remember who I am, and they’re always willing to help. You don’t see that anywhere else (maybe Trader Joe’s). 
I've done some contracted work to repair things in their stores before. They work hard. I don't know if I'd want to do it.  Having said that, I have found in the past with other jobs that working hard makes the time go by very quickly
Probably because Aldi comes from Germany.  It is quite ironic, when Walmart expanded to Germany without changing much of their business ways it was a dumpster fire (so many lawsuits).  When Aldi went to the USA without changing much of their strategy it worked out fine. (In Germany I dont know a single big store here were employees dont sit down).
He couldn't buy a $111M home.
That’s not how any of that works, tho. His income comes mostly from selling stuff, which is subject to capital gains taxes. Those headlines talk about the paper value of his assets, which is meaningless until you sell. Though his investments are so big, that they’re market moving except for the most liquid asset classes.  Which brings me back to the point, taxing him at 99% of his income would barely raise any taxes at all, since he doesn’t work anymore.   Edit: thanks for the gold, whoever that was. 
Most of his wealth isn't realized. Its stocks in Microsoft. He doesn't have a hundred billion dollars in a  bank account.  His net worth reflects perceived value of Microsoft (and whatever other assets he owns). That value is tied up in business deals, warehouses, factories, intellectual property, brand values, vehicles, office buildings, etc.  I don't know how you actually tax all that without just having the government take over Microsoft.  When he does realize his gains by selling his assets, he will pay a capital gains tax. You might think that is not enough, but it's a separate discussion.
He also got in trouble for not maintaining the grave plot he had bought upfront for his family - turned out he was waiting for gardening equipment to go on Special Buy. 
It's a common issue when the union is no longer seperate from the company and basically acts like an arm of the company. If you're forced to join the union to join the company it's almost always that way unfortunately.
Henry Ford didn't just advocate shorter work days. He also backed guaranteeing days off every week.
There are more German companies than just Aldi that hire in the US.   My dad worked for Medi Manufacturing, as a mechanic for making support hose. He had amazing healthcare, lots of sick and vacation time, and whenever the Germans came to visit the plant they'd bring treats from Germany for all the workers. He's been retired on disability for like 5 years and their insurance is still paying part of his match for disability until he turns 65 (or something like that, I never understood it entirely)
Really the only way anything will happen. Unfortunately Americans are so set in their ways anyone who makes a stand (or sit) for realistic labor reform would be called a sissy snowflake despite the plethora of evidence that shows standing all day is bad for you 
"They think sitting people look lazy and unprofessional - ""employees should be on their feet and look busy"". This thinking is entirely wrong, of course."
"Not OP but here are some poor grad student LPTs. You can buy multiple loaves of bread and freeze them. When you're near the end of an old one get another from the freezer and let it thaw overnight. They stay fresh for a pretty long time after you thaw them. Some breads are shipped even frozen and let thaw at the grocery store (I used to work at one) so it's basically the same thing.  Meat, you can obviously do the same.   For some daily fruit servings: buy frozen berries. They're cheap, just as nutritious, and don't need to be washed. You can make a smoothie or replace ice cubes with frozen berries. They cool your water and at the end your left with delicious, tart or sweet berries to snack on. Perfect for ""Infused"" water or mixed drinks. On top of that they can last forever in your freezer and you don't have to worry about throwing your money away."
sorry I don’t speak skyrim 
> maybe Trader Joe’s  Coincidentally thats also Aldi. Just the American store of the second Aldi chain. There is Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd, the two founding brothers basically split up the country between them.
My aunt worked there and said it is hard work but they pay well and have nice benefits.  We had a big snow storm this past weekend in nothern Ohio so I went there Friday, it was packed.  I thought I was going to be there awhile but was in and out in about 20 minutes.  There's a major grocery store across the street and the parking lot was jam packed and I'm sure the lines were slow.
Math checks out 
When he says he feels like a million bucks, that's a bad thing.
Which is why capital gains should be taxed as income if it is your primary source of income.
Part of an IPO to become publicly traded is raising fund from investors. If you took the stock market away you’d be stuck with the same huge conglomerates because it’s now way harder for new companies to get funding to grow. 
Privately held companies still have shareholders who want to make a return on their investment.  If a company wants to be a good corporate citizen, they first have to be successful.  Aldi is raising wages BECAUSE they made more money, which will help retaining higher quality labor, which in turn will hopefully spur more revenue.  
Oooh ya keep talking dirty to me
"I can translate.  Trader Joes is for the Nords, and ALDI is for them stinkin' elves.  The parking lots are the warzones.  It's customary to yell ""Victory or Sovngarde!"" when you spot that rare available parking spot."
"Well, sort of, but NOT REALLY. Not like he doesn't have a ""rainy day $111M house buying fund"" stashed away somewhere from all the money hes made in years past."
That would hurt people who barely have enough for retirement more than the rich. It'd need to be tiered.
He had many major surgeries while employed there, his boss always assured him his job was safe and to concentrate on getting better. When he felt like he might be in too much pain to go too much longer, they hired a guy for him to train to be his replacement to work with him until he left. Christmas bonuses.
I really hope Bill Gates visits my house someday and loves it so much he impulse buys it for 111M, but I’d also take $500,000. That would literally be life changing. 
> It'd need to be tiered.  You mean like income taxes already are?  I mean, come on, if you go on unemployment you *still* pay taxes.
I've replaced most of my facebook time with reddit time.  As have several others I know.    Not sure if that's better or not.  I enjoy it more though.    Edit 1:  Thank you for the gold kind stranger!!!  Edit 2:  And thank you as well nice stranger!!!  Edit 3:  Wow, thank you as well stranger #3!!!
I guess my wife finally deleted her account. 
2006:  Facebook is going to be the next MySpace  2018:  Facebook is going to be the next MySpace
Thank:   1) separation of messenger into it's own app   2) invasive advertisements throughout the main app   3) trying to become a video platform but putting advertisements in the *middle* of short videos   4) app instability (it never loads what you were last looking at)   5) trying to turn it into Instagram with stories   6) live videos from friends no one wants to see and the period of time where those videos would automatically appear on your screen  Probably other stuff too but this all grinded my gears
I’ve been slowly stepping away from Facebook, I check it for a little bit and call it good. The worst part is when I’m watching a video and it says “ad starting in 3..2..1” and then I’m done for the day.  Instagram is starting to get worse and worse with all the ads. So I’m almost at the point where I’ll look for a few then move on.   Reddit to me feels kinda like the “old internet”. Pure anonymity and just posting whatever the hell you want. 
Here come the people who spend 12 hours a day on Reddit boasting about how awful social media is and how they're a superior person because they deleted their Facebook
"Because it fucking *sucks* now.   I don't even mean the kind of ""oh noes, everybody and their grandmother is on it!"" gatekeeping type sucks either. I mean just *sucks*.  The whole point of Facebook for me and damn near the majority of users is simply to keep up with people. Except Facebook increasingly makes that difficult. Why is it showing me photos of friends of friends that I don't know? I don't give a fuck that the new coworker of an ex-coworker is now getting married. Why the fuck are you showing me baby pictures of people I don't know, Facebook? Like Jesus Fucking Christ, guys, you had *one job*... show me the shit posted by the people I'm friends with in the order in which it is posted... and YOU DON'T DO THAT.  That's why people are spending less time on Facebook. It's not some great awakening where people are ditching social media and joining bowling leagues to hang out with their neighbors. They're just sick of Facebook sucking big donkey dick."
Facebook for me is just filled with friends and family that just share viral videos and photos. Nothing genuine gets posted unless someone gets engaged, graduates, has a baby, or if someone dies. 
In other news, people are spending 50 million more hours on reddit a day.
Facebook is dead.  Edit: Many Facebook, such defence, too edge.
Pretty much the only thing I use Facebook for is messenger to communicate with friends now.   
50 million fewer views of being exposed to Debbie's latest motivational quote or Sarah's 19th pic of the day of her youngest child.
Facebook is crap, Reddit is better because  I can avoid some topics and downvote dumb stuff into oblivion.
10-15 years ago, Facebook was a God-send to catch up with elementary/grade school and college friends, and always feel welcomed by their presence.  Now, it's a cesspool of sponsored crap, political idiocy and older family siblings trying to be cool with their kids who've since migrated to Instagram, Tindr and other anonymous social media sites.
It's kinda weird because my younger cousins, 17 and 14, see Facebook as stupid.. they use Snapchat and Instagram. It looks like Facebook might start losing popularity soon because it seems the new generation doesn't want it.
I deleted my Facebook page at the beginning of the year. One of the best decisions I've made for my mental well-being. 
This whole comment section is like an AA meeting for recovering Facebook users.
Ditto. When I see dumb stuff on here, I can move on and not have to wonder why my friend/relative believes such crazy shit. 
That’s because Reddit is content you want, from people you don’t know. Way better than Facebook: content you don’t want, from people you know.
Same here. And, as long as I stay out of certain political subs here, I find it *much* more enjoyable than Facebook.
it's because the facebook newsfeed turned into a steaming pile of garbage videos.  At least instagram is photos and not as intrusive.  but facebook has way too much video garbage.
Facebook is just littered by videos now. No one posts anything about their lives anymore, my newsfeed I cant even scroll and go to a different application without a video automatically playing. 
I ditched my fakebook back in 2012.  When you reach your 30s, it just felt really weird to have all these fake friendships that only existed on the internet.  I didn't truly know most of the people on there anymore, I spoke to them 15 years ago in high school, or hung out with them a few times through other friends, they send me a friend request and I just say OK.    For obvious reasons, I stopped feeling like my life sucks compared to all these people, who are living these great, excited lives that they all post about... to get likes and thumbs up from other people, who want a like and thumbs up.  Shit's dumb.  I have a reddit account and that's it, no one knows my name either so they can't read my stupid posts.
Has she also begun to hit the gym? Because I may have some bad news for you...
Women am i right FELLAS? Edit: its a shitty joke everyone please stay calm

"I honestly would probably still use FB if it had the design of something before 2012ish. Back then it actually focused on the people and social interaction. It was clean, it was smooth and it was organized. I was able to see what I wanted to see, share stuff with my friends and basically enhance my friendships virtually without being screamed in my face to check this or that out or play or buy or whatever.  Todays FB is a clusterfuck of shit I don't care about, bloated up into oblivion with commercials, advertisements, ""funny"" videos I saw on Reddit already years ago. And every now and then in this pure chaos I'm able to see a single picture or post that one of my friends postet - just to have it vanished into darkness once I refreshed my page."
And fucking. Sponsored. Content. If I see one more, “5 fashion mistakes girls want guys to stop making” article that’s just an ad for various clothes designers, I’m going to delete it.   Not really because my school lets professors put their course pages on Facebook, forcing everyone enrolled to have a Facebook, but it’s damn close. 
>4) app instability (it never loads what you were last looking at)     This pisses me off so goddamn much. I went to a new tab on mobile and now the one story I want to read is no where to be found 
Also, content-wise, I feel like Facebook is a lot more political meme battles and a lot less updates about people I care about.
7) Everyone and their grandma is now using it to pimp their MLM scams. Hardcore. Half my newsfeed is MLM bullshit. 
I left both facebook and Instagram when they stopped putting post in chronological order.
"They definitely are killing their own platform by allowing it to become a political cesspool. LinkedIn posts are starting to get political and I see some people saying ""This isn't Facebook, keep this off linkedin."" Slowly but surely those people will disappear and LinkedIn will just be another social media mess."
The first reason is why I stopped FB. I was very active on messenger, then it became it's own app, requiring a shit ton of unnecessary permissions. I resisted it, then adopted it, then deleted it all. That and the fact FB listens to people (microphone permissions) to tailor ads to them, and really, who knows what else. We did an experiment where we talked about a very obscure product we would never buy (think Roomba). Lo and behold, a week later we are getting Roomba ads. Facebook cant die fast enough.
7) randomizing notifications instead of chronological
Honestly FB can go fuck themselves with the bullshit ad in the middle of videos. 
Second worst part is wanting to read the comments on a post but they're all just tagged people 
Which is better?  Reddit or Facebook?
Psh. I only spend 6 hours a day on Reddit, and 14 hours playing video games. 
They are very different though. I come to Reddit to laugh, talk football or argue politics anonymously. Fb is basically people my age (20's) who have a need to get likes for self validation and my old relatives posting pictures of birds and random statuses
"My go-to example for a while has been ""a post by a page you've never seen was shared by a person you've never met, which was then commented on by a friend you haven't seen in five years.""  So? Why in god's name would I care?"
That’s the problem. It wasn’t supposed to be that way, but they let it. Facebook isn’t even #1 in the viral news. By the time you’re seeing it on Facebook it’s hours possibly days late already. 
Reddit is a superior platform for my needs
Facebook made a VERY smart move in buying Instagram. Almost all youth have that app; even if Facebook dies, they can still fall back on Insta.
They committed sepuku to their primary audience/membership the minute they made the hard push to recruit the very adults that we were all avoiding.   Here, all those “avoid at all costs” relatives sequester themselves to individual subs. This place is great. 
I'd scrobble that.
Don't even need a Facebook account for that now 
You don't even need Facebook for that anymore. I deactivated my Facebook and still have messenger
You're forgetting the pyramid scheme/MLM women posting their before and after fitness and make up pics and how much money theyre making working from their phone. 
And I have no idea if any of you are my relatives. Right, dad?
Well of course, their parents are on it now. Kids don't want this.
Just a warning, Reddit might end up like FB. They’re trying hard to push user profiles on here. That’s not what Reddit used to be about. 
You just made me realise that the beauty of anonymity can go both ways!
Same reason I left. Was bad enough hearing political bullshit from relatives at holidays.   The never ending barrage of “outrage” was too much. I could unfriend everyone, but then Facebook is pointless. FB no longer served a purpose in my life. Deleted the account and, after about a month, it get so much better.   It was weird not having an outlet for my thoughts, but I realized not having a Facebook outlet to talk to people forced me to communicate with those around me. As an introvert, getting rid of Facebook has been fantastic. 
> That’s because Reddit is content you want, from ~~people you don’t know~~ **GallowBob**. Way better than Facebook: content you don’t want, from people you know.  FTFY

She's hiring a divorce lawyer?
"There's a scene in Social Network where Mark Zuckerberg loads up FB for Eduardo so he can see what it looks like. When it appears he describes it as ""clean and simple."" It was the complete opposite of what the average Myspace page looked like.   Nowadays FB is just as convoluted as myspace ever was, if not more.  "
"Also: what's wrong with just being able to see every post from my friends? Why is stuff hidden from me at random?  I've literally missed births and deaths, but I learned what they had for lunch.  And now they've scrubbed all comments and reactions from ""On This Day,"" which was *the only fucking reason I ever looked back on stuff I posted*. I hate FB so much, and the only reason I'm still on there is because it's the only means I have of regular contact with people in different parts of the world with whom I still have a worthwhile relationship—people I'm very unlikely to see IRL ever again."
Nowadays my news feed is 80-90% garbage. Back when Facebook was good it was 80-90% updates about friends
> my school lets professors put their course pages on Facebook, forcing everyone enrolled to have a Facebook,  Damn that's a stupid, low rent requirement.
When I was at school we the students demanded that professors not use FB for class related material. It worked. No course pages on FB. 
At least you can hand-pick good channels on YouTube.  On Facebook,  there really just isn't much quality content to be found.   It's just endless selfies, pictures of food, inspirational quotes, and half-baked political ramblings. 
"It's an algorithm that Facebook is trying to SHOW you what it thinks you want to see, often wrong as fuck.  When I got fiber internet, I loaded facebook and scrolled down with the center mouse button.  It started stuttering really bad when it had been through all the bullshit it was supposed to show me, and didn't know what to show me next.  It's a bullshit application, monetizing the ""wall"" or ""news feed"" will be their downfall."
I never realized how much I hated Facebook for the simple fact that when I see something I'm interested in and want to look at it 2 seconds later and it's gone. It makes me so mad.
"Yeah, it's actually kinda sad how facebook just turned into another ""meme-sharing site"".   I realize I'm putting on some rose-tinted glasses here, but I remember a time where my newsfeed was full of pictures of my friends doing stuff, their thoughts on current matters, content they created themselves, etc.   Nowadays, it's just clogged up with ""XYZ liked DANK MEMES OFFICIAL's video"", which is not what I'm on Facebook for."
"No joke I saw the following the other day:  (Photo of the blood moon the other day)... ""Wow how awesome is that moon! And in honor of the blood moon, I'm offering 30% off all orders in the next 24 hours!!!"""
It's gotta be one of the most annoying things on the internet. The rare occasion I visit that shit site and see a video I miraculously haven't seen on Reddit, I'm met with that bullshit ad. I will make it a point to exit Facebook and search for the video on Reddit, even if it's more inconvenient to me. Fuck Facebook. The only reason I'm still tied to that shitty site is bc of my friends who live in other countries. 
u/BreadL0bster
Coke or Mountain Dew?
I read so much on reddit, tons of articles and learn so much. How on earth can anyone draw any comparison between reddit and facebook?
Millenials for you. When I was young i worked 23 hours a day in a coal mine. Hd other hour was spent drinking rye!!!
"One I get a lot is posts showing up in my feed saying ""your friend likes this page."" Not that my friend liked the actual post. Just that they like that page, so here's a random post from that page from a week ago.  Or the old, ""[friend] replied to a comment on this post"" with a truncated preview of their reply. Of course, clicking on that preview doesn't take you to their reply or the comment they replied to. In fact it's fucking impossible to actually find the comment it's referring to without sifting through literally thousands of comments."
Takes a bit of time to add a shitty border with:  **Tag someone who is just like this!!!** 😂😂😂😂😂😂  Original content.
Excactly. I don't need pesky things like friends ruining my social media experience
"Dont forget the random pages i liked when i was 15 that are now clickbait sites loaded with stupid ""top lists"" and ""things you wouldnt believe this celeb does"" etc."
Nope. 
Best thing about a huuuge anonymous social discussion forum like reddit is that I can be whoever I want! A psychologist, a art critic, an expert on human feces, a cat, you name it! It's all me!  *fade out the mountain landscape background with a welcome to E3 2018 sign*
myspace was slightly worse because you'd go to someones page and then suddenly...EAR RAPE!  Loud blaring music.  I was on myspace for maybe a total of 30 minutes before i said fuck this shit.   Scared me off social media for so long I didn't use facebook until 2011.  Then I deleted it 2016 after that shit show of an election.  I think facebook was responsible for destroying more family relationships in 2016 than heroin.
If you saw my newsfeed, you would think that only 8-10 people on my friend’s list post actively. Also, why does it hide other people’s posts then share days’ old posts from the aforementioned 8-10 people?  I don’t really post or use it for socializing anymore. The Marketplace or buy/sell/trade groups are what I use FB for nowadays.
"I had a college professor do this with Twitter. You had to follow him for ""course discussion to get bonus credit."" Creep "
Hey now, MY political ramblings on Facebook are 3/4's baked..
That and I get updates when my friends from college update their status. Like, people I haven’t talked to in 6 years post something, and you think I need to know about it. I really couldn’t care less about 90% or more of my notifications.   (If there is an option to disable this, I truly don’t care enough to look for it as I hardly ever log on)
"Thats the main issue I have with facebook. It's not what my friends are posting, its not the multitude of recipes being shared, its not the ads. Its the fact that I used facebook the *most* when the timeline was chronological.  When my friends were at an event or on vacation or whatnot and they would post pictures it was fun to see what they were doing right then and there when I happened to check the timeline  Now it's like you have no idea what people are posting unless you go to their page specifically, or if by luck that their posts got enough likes 4 days later to eventually show you what happened now that its ~popular~ enough.  EDIT: Twitter keeps trying to do this as well, especially in the app with the ""what you missed""   If someone posted in 24 hours chances are I'm going to get that far down on twitter anyway, I don't need ""cultivated"" posts for me. "
"""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED"" -FB Algorithm"
This sounds like the advent of pages and second accounts and how those took over Facebook towards 2011 - 2014.
do it dude.  i deleted mine about 8 months ago because i never opened it and was tired of people getting mad at me for not responding to their messages or going to their event because the invite was facebook only. and when i did check it, i'd spend a lot of time creeping on people i haven't even seen in 10 years. and learning too much about people's worldviews and realizing i don't like them and just never knew it.  i unfriended everyone, deleted every single post on my wall from the past 12 years, saved all my good pictures to my hard drive and then deleted them from facebook, untagged myself from everything i was tagged in, changed my name, deactivated my page, then had them delete it. i've never even felt the slightest urge to go back.  
Wait a minute, you can search Reddit and actually find what you’re looking for? 
I like them together... sniff a big line and down some dew, gets the heart racing!
We just want CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IS THAT SO HARD
Why I left. “Just be friends with all these in-laws, aunts, uncles, and cousins”. My news feed was filled with chem-trail, science denying drivel.   I found myself getting very angry, and it wasn’t worth it. 
>a art  not an English teacher tho 
Says the talking axe.
Holy shit! This is LITERALLY what happened to me, word for word, year for year...yes
"I'm in grad school right now on a teaching track, and I started think ""hey that might not be a bad idea, great way to have discussions, post relevant material, maybe do some polls""  Nope.   Fuck that.  Do not need that shit. "
I tend to wait until I'm fully baked before putting my ramblings on FB.
"Facebook: ""Hey! Your friend's band is playing the Cool Bar tonight at 9:00...""  Me: ""Sweet! That sounds like fun!""  Facebook: ""...posted 3 days ago.""  Me: :-("
As someone who doesn't check Facebook super often, I end up liking and commenting on shit that's a week old because Facebook never shows me what's going on right now. It only shows me what I have already missed. It's stupid  and because of it, I find myself using Facebook less and less. 
">Its the fact that I used facebook the *most* when the timeline was chronological.  When my friends were at an event or on vacation or whatnot and they would post pictures it was fun to see what they were doing right then and there when I happened to check the timeline.  Back when you could check every now and then and scroll to the point where ""I saw that before, must be caught up now"""
Yeah that statement made me instantly suspicious
Wait that's why all my shit is out of order? Mother fuckers
"They for some reason made the feed not chronological anymore, there are ads every 5th or 6th post, and now they're showing me things (that aren't ads) that I don't follow or subscribe to, in my feed, that I can't opt out of seeing. So my feed went from 100% what I want to see, to like 50% what I follow, 25% ads, 25% ""recommended"""
They basically made it a Snapchat clone, and not even a good one (this a very personal opinion though). The UI is convoluted as hell, it's full of ads and they keep adding features that I personally find stupid. For example, you can add text with background colors to stories now which makes people start using stories as an annoying Twitter.
:(
Dude, just use Blackboard or Instructure, or something. Works wonders, and you can track student progress through everything, they can see their progress, they can share files and shit... it's great.
Or you could just delete Facebook 
"Don't forget the ""you did this crap 6 years ago"", do you really think I want to go through my cringey teenage years."
I just Google the title of the video (cause every repost recycles titles) and tac Reddit on the end of it. Use their news/video/image/recent tabs to wade through the Reddit marshes cause it's more efficient than Reddit search.
I use it to delete cringe posts. 
"I don't understand the people who are saying ""16 years is too long wtf"".   He's a full time farmer working with polluted land, going up against a major corporation, with only 3 years of formal education. Most of that 16 years was spent farming. "
>At the time, he did not have money to buy the books, so he spent day after day reading the books at the local book store and copying the relevant information by hand, according to the man. In return, he would give bags of free corn to the shopkeeper for letting him stay there.  what a legend.
Chemical companies dumping their waste on other people's land happens a lot in China. My husband's customer had this happen to their fields. They were previously growing organic vegetables there. They are suing and I hope they win.
Still cheaper than hiring a lawyer
This is great for the farmers. I hope there aren't anymore delays with their court case.
>...Mr Wang was playing cards and making dumplings with his neighbours. All of sudden, they realised that the house they were in was flooded by the wastewater from the nearby Qihua factory  u got to watch out for that sneaky wastewater
DIY culture has evolved
I saw the documentary.  It's called Law Abiding Citizen.
Either this is the most dedicated person I've ever heard of, or he spent the majority of those 16 years procrastinating. 
Meanwhile, Chemical firm spends couple of weeks worth of their profits for lobbying lawmakers to pass legislation in their favor
But the montage in my head showed him doing nothing but sipping coffee and reading for 16 years.  Eye of the tiiiiger.
He also waited 8 years for them to accept the request so i think he was ready earlier than 16 years.
Also, most people here may not realize that being a farmer in China is *drastically different* from being a farmer in the US. Imagine something more like [this](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2013/08/21/chinese-farmers.jpg) (sourced from a [recent article](http://www.ibtimes.com/field-dreams-7-reasons-why-you-dont-want-be-farmer-china-1394965) about farming in China) instead of [this](http://www.dadychery.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Tractors_farm.jpg). For various reasons, there's much less machinery involved in farming in China, which means that farmers spend a LOT more time doing manual labor ([this](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-reality-of-life-onn-a-rural-chinese-farm-2010-11) is an article originally from the Atlantic that touches on the subject). To truly imagine his situation, you'd need to imagine that you have to work a labor intensive job day in and day out, surviving on a paltry income even compared to the poorer half of the country. You don't have a computer let alone internet access, which greatly limits the amount of resource you have access to. So yeah, I'm incredibly impressed that he taught himself with only three years of formal education under such tough conditions.
Not just that. He is Chinese. He was a nobody in China (where calling someone a poor farmer is about the worst insult in the world), and won!  On a land issue! Do some people not get how crazy that is? You can't even own land, by PRC law! And he was suing a state owned corporation! This wasn't likely to happen in a billion years.
"After he wins his case..  ""You're probably wondering how I ended up here, me, a simple farmer in a court of law.. well.."""
Wo shi Legend.
Bags of polluted corn. Jk
Happens a lot in the US as well. They just spend more money convincing people it doesn't. 
I feel there is a market for lawyers in this area of expertise that somebody could move in on (potentially this guy now that he has the knowledge) to help other farmers suffering this same issue? He is extremely experienced and determined, maybe not technically qualified, but just as well in the right. I'm running on the assumption that even if there is aid in this area already, that they likely lack the contact or funds to access the help they need. Do you know if this the case?
they did have legal advisers giving free legal advice and help.  >In 2007, a Chinese law firm specialised in handling pollution-related cases started providing free legal advice to Mr Wang and his neighbours. They also agreed to help the villagers file petition to the court.  >However due to unspecified complications, the court only began processing Mr Wang and his neighbours' case in 2015 - eight years after the original petition had been made, People's Daily Online reported.
Chemical companies HATE him! See how this local farmer got them to pay him millions in only 16 years.
Yet somehow r/farming doesn't seem to be as on board. Although they hate anything that isn't sponsored and written by Monsanto 
Build a wall to keep it out?
He probably spent 15 years farming, and 1 year studying scattered throughout the total of 16.
Climbing the steps of the court house with law textbooks strapped to his ankles.
*You're the best!*  *Around!*  *Nothing's gonna keep your harvest down!*
Aactually shorter than 8 yrs The request court held for 8 years was from the law firm helping him.  So before that he actually visit the local authorities daily to seek for help and collecting evidence, yet the authorities refuse to provide evidence (which should be  open to all citizens,they refuse to provide it,coz Qihua is the largest tax payer in the city,sooo corruption lul) ,until he stated that he have the right provided by the law to get the evidence (pollution data etc.) Sorry for my bad English though :)  source: people's daily online (which this article cited from)   
Wo yao yi ping pi jiu.
Wastewater? Organics? Same thing! Find out tonight at 6!
"""We didn't do that.""  ""It wasn't us.""  ""We didn't know.""  ""We dumped it legally outside of the property limits, not our fault it seeped in afterwards.""  ""That is actually our property.""  ""We counter-sue.""  ""Here's a bunch of money to make the problem go away.""  ...Take your pick."
90% would probably be excessive. Closer to 40. 
yeah but you don't have to wait 16 years.
It's because farmers know more about Monsanto and Monsanto products than most people. 
If you read the article, the man had just 3 years of formal education. So he wasn't starting at the same point that law students start. Plus, he's a farmer, not a law student who can dedicate all of his time to studying.
And then tumbling back down the steps, legs akimbo, just a flurry of books and pages, while the Benny Hill theme plays obnoxiously in the background.
> what is the real story here Daily Mail  They'd be the last to know.
I have plenty of respect for this guy but litigating with no experience is nearly impossible. A law degree is the requirement for practice and I would say 95% is on the job learning. The degree just gives you the skills to be able to learn.
This doesn't fit my narrative of all lawyers being bloodsucking corporate parasites. 
~~Chinese~~ courts are a bitch
"Am farmer, can confirm.  After heading back to the family farm to get heavily into farming I took some ""I hate Monsanto"" preconceptions with me but that mostly evaporated after actually understanding more about the situation than just reading some fear mongering articles and watching a documentary.  I've also done a 180 on gmo crops as well for the most part."
We'll make the wastewater pay for it all.
*Cue slide whistle*
"From the article: ""In 2007, a Chinese law firm specialised in handling pollution-related cases started providing free legal advice to Mr Wang and his neighbours. They also agreed to help the villagers file petition to the court.""  So it really sounds more like this guy figured out what the rules of evidence were and what specific laws had been broken and then the law firm handled the paperwork side of things."
Matt Damon did it when he was just a young janitor.
I studied genetics in University and I did a 180 on GMOs as a whole (not just crops). Monsanto on the other hand, I still believe they are a company with unethical business practices and should be heavily investigated. But then again, I could be wrong on that too.
What other tricks can ya do with that there whistle?
MATT DAMON BUILD HIS LAW DEGREE IN A CAVE WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS
Essentially Organic farming is not sustainable on the scale that the US is on when it comes to sheer amount of crops produced. Organic farming is great because yeah, it's the local guys who've been in the area for generations but those aren't the type of farmers who are going to supply 15.2 billion bushels of corn per year. Organic farming will never be that efficient unless you modify the genetics of plants in order to fit the region. GMO has turned into such a buzzword and a synonym for *processed* foods when in reality it's just a seed that's been optimized to grow in certain areas at certain times of year.

*“I wanted to teach them how to launch Microsoft Word. But I had no computer to show them, I had to do my best. So, I decided to draw what the screen looks like on the blackboard with chalk.”*  *“I have been doing this every time the lesson I’m teaching demands it,” Akoto continued. “I’ve drawn monitors, system units, keyboards, a mouse, a formatting toolbar, a drawing toolbar, and so on.

That's great! I have no doubt they learned more about Word on a blackboard with no computer than my manager has in his entire life.

Does the school even have reliable access to electricity? 
Good to see that hard work can really pay off! Mr. Akoto deserves to win a Teacher of the Year award.
I remember the post when they shared here on reddit, tons of people were looking for ways to help. No matter from where glad to see they got some computers and that now these kids can learn how to use a computer. Yay!  Edit: ways to help, not hell 😬
That guy's a fuggin legend. Hopefully things get better there
Well that made me happy, I remember the post where he drew the image of MS word on a blackboard from a while ago.  Good for them!  If I remember the post was under /r/funny, glad it turned out to be uplifting.
"So much ignorance from many posters. Ghana is one of the better developing African countries and is a better place to live than say, most ""developed"" countries in the early 20th century were. It is not a country in acute risk of starvation or conflict, those computers aren't gonna be sold for food, and most of the population actually has electricity."
How'd he install Word on a blackboard?
Yeah, this dude just sounds incredible. Man, what a great guy. Glad I read all of this, great thing to come upon waking up. 
The world needs more people like this who care enough to think of something like this. The desire to teach must be very strong with him.
What an amazing man. This is one of the coolest things I've ever heard of. I teach in America, and I have everything I could need provided. His dedication makes me tear up.

Nominate that guy for teacher of the year award, for real
Wow that looks satisfying seeing an almost Word-replica on a chalkboard. Must have taken some effort.
Ghanaian here, yes in cities we kinda have reliable access to electricity. In remote areas, which be been to and experienced first hand, it’s about 60 percent of the time. But better sometimes than nothing.   Ideally, it would be better if they included solar panels and batteries. But, can’t guarantee someone wouldn’t just take em away anyways or not maintain it properly. We have optimal conditions for solar power and a lot of people are shifting off the grid to solar (its expensive though).

Same, cool to see a follow up story to what I thought was a random interesting picture on the internet. I love the internet and Reddit 
It saddens me to see how many teachers don't have the passion to teach. i had the luck that most of my teachers were true passionates like this man and they inspired me greatly.  Events, people like these have a profiund imoact on the future of a generation. They have an incredible responsability 
We appreciate you too man, keep on keeping on. You're all doing vital jobs. 
Make that Boss + half the company.

Looks like he's using MS Word XP Chalkboard Edition since it's using the older toolbars and not the more recent Ribbon™.
Calling Elon Musk. School kids in badly need of a solar power grid. Calling Elon Musk...
I hope I didn't cause any offense with my question. Sekyedumase was described as a rural area when I looked it up, and it wasn't clear to me if the infrastructure there could be sufficiently reliable for regular use of the generous gifts. So thank you for answering!  I've seen Ghana in the news a lot lately, because of the investments the country is making in technology and education, some of them causing an influx of foreigners and, in part, inflation in the real estate market in big cities like Accra.  If you don't mind me asking, what's your sentiment on how sustainable these investments are? Do regular Ghanaians see things improving? 
> It saddens me to see how many teachers don't have the passion to teach.  And how many passionate teachers are not paid enough.

And get their passion stamped out of them because of the focus on testing rather than learning.
All. All teachers k-12 and many at higher levels are not paid enough for what they do. I would like to see teachers and politicians switch incomes.

It's in orbit...
Yes, well..  To the Boring Machine!
Awful students? Certainly. Awful parents? Even more so. 
Yeah!!!!!  ALL cards should do this!
Buying coffee $3, online order for your favorite team's jersey $40, preventing disingenuous, deceitful companies from scamming people by telling them something is free and then forcing them to provide a credit card in hopes they'll forget to cancel and then charge those customers endlessly -- priceless.
This is fantastic! I avoid the free trials like the plague to “try it out” because without fail I’ll forget
Good guy MasterCard? Wtf?
Auto-billing is a perfect example of why consumers shouldn't assume companies have any real care for their clients. I hope this becomes the industry standard and soon.
This policy change is only applicable to physical items. Most subscription fees after a free trial won't be affected. :(   https://newsroom.mastercard.com/2019/01/16/free-trials-without-the-hassle/  > *This blog was updated on January 17, 2019 to clarify that the rule change is applicable to physical products such as skincare, healthcare items etc.
It is from January.
Using the top comment to point out that I am 95% sure it is only on very specific types of transactions... like it's not ALL free trial transactions. So don't assume this covers 100% of those. You should still do your due diligence and make sure the free trial is cancelled before it starts billing. I will try to find source on this. But I myself am a source as I work at Mastercard.  Edit: the actual Mastercard publication has an update where it says at the bottom it's for ONLY physical goods. So the free trial of Apple Music, or any other service or digital good (i.e., mobile application, streaming platform subscription, etc.), is not covered by this - https://newsroom.mastercard.com/2019/01/16/free-trials-without-the-hassle/
I agree. Will companies put in the terms and conditions “you agree to autorenew” before you sign up, or how will MasterCard prevent that? You know businesses are already working to circumvent this.
Now that’s actually an incredible marketing plan right there. Throwback to a slogan we all know, with a modern twist of “actually doing something to benefit you”. Call em up.
Businesses count on you forgetting.
Privacy.com allows you to generate 1 time cards or cards with a specific limit and generates a new cc number for each one. You can just kill a card off if there's a problem with it. It's fucking great.
Don't get me wrong, I think it's great but they are a business and they most likely just do it because it saves themselves money and hassle if less people try to get their money back after they forgot to cancel the free month.
To the top with you.  This is a really important clarification.  Thank you.
Even if they can’t ban it outright, a warning would be nice
Mastercard: Fucking you a little less than visa and amex
Or because it’s a reason to get MasterCard instead of Visa.
i dont really see the difference payment wise, if its a free trial end the trial period is over there should be no automatic billing unless the service was so good you choose to renew your subscription.  for this basic principal it doesnt matter if its a digital service or a physical thing.
Fubo.tv sent me a warning, after I cancelled they still charged my card $70. Still fighting to get it refunded.
Mastercard: We use lube.
Sounds like you need to get in contact with your card company
Fucking hell that was a close one
> Local and state police followed the mom’s tip, and on Thursday, officers drove to the home of a 20-year-old man named Dylan Jarrell, just as he was leaving his house with more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, a firearm, a 100-round high-capacity magazine, and a “detailed plan of attack.”  Close one. Kudos to mom.
"""When police searched Jarrell’s home, they found an internet search history on “How to conduct a school shooting”..."""
This is like one of those times when you think what if you could go back in time and stop a terrorist attack or kill Hitler, and it actually happened.
This was a close one in so many ways. We only caught him because:  * He sent a racist message to a woman in another state the day before the his planned shooting.  * She felt unnerved enough to share a screenshot to find information about him instead of just ignoring it or blocking him.  * She went out of her way to call the police in another state.  * The officer she spoke to agreed to investigate instead of ignoring it, when online hate speech is often treated as a minor offense and could be ignored in favor of more urgent matters.  * The police arrived right as he left his house, catching him loaded with weapons and seeing enough obvious ill intent to justify detaining him and searching his house ASAP without a warrant.  If a single one of those factors changed, he very likely would have gotten away with it. He would have been caught and identified for sure, but not until AFTER he devastated one school. The sheer probability of this chain of events occurring to stop him is so ridiculously low.  If multiverse theory exists, I think we're in the minority of universes where this shooting did not occur.
What in the actual fuck!? I have family that works there, this woman could have saved them! Holy shit thank you lady who probably will never read this!
That Mom saved every kid at that school a lifetime of emotional issues at the very least.  What a hero.
Holy fucking shit. Good on the cops taking her seriously.
I’m giving this silver and gold because this needs to be talked about more than tragedies.   Celebrate this hero. And the police officer hero who took this seriously. It happens more than we think but I’m happy this officer took their job seriously even from a nervous mother. 
"Dude in Vermont got arrested after a friend tipped police, they found a shotgun, ammo, and a journal he titled ""diary of an active shooter."" Which detailed his plans to shoot up his old high school. He confessed he was going to do it if he hadn't been caught before, and got acquitted of charges because it's not a crime to plan to do a crime. He spent some time in a mental ward and the ward isn't even  allowed to tell police whether or not the suspect is even still admitted there.  His name is Jack Sawyer. NPR did a podcast about it.  From CBS:  ""In Vermont, ""planning"" isn't ""attempting."" So last week, hard as it may be to believe, prosecutors were forced to drop the felony charges against Sawyer, after the Supreme Court ruled there was ""no attempt,"" since the act had not been committed.""  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/charges-dropped-against-jack-sawyer-teen-accused-of-threatening-school-shooting-in-vermont/  https://www.npr.org/podcasts/642455340/j-o-l-t-e-d  * edit to add sources"
Outstanding gut feeling! Not just in the possibility of this asshole doing this but, even more so for the intuition if her local authorities not giving a rats ass about it. 
"The guy googled ""How to conduct a school shooting""  Come on man, you've seen enough examples by now"
“Police also revealed that in May, Jarrell had been questioned by the FBI regarding social media threats toward a Tennessee school.   Jarrell was charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications and is being held in the Shelby County Detention Center.”  How did he not have his guns taken in May? This seems so obvious. 
i mean im against NSA and spying like anyone but i know its done.  how does 'how to conduct a school shooting' not trigger anything in the search engine to flag the IP?
This is great. The only downside is a bunch of other moms will use it as proof that their gut feelings about the bearded guy at the playground or the black guy walking through their neighborhood deserve the police's time and attention. 
>“He had the tools necessary, the intent necessary. And the only thing that stood between him and evil … is law enforcement,”   And a badass mom named Koeberle Bull too. Ultimately, she's the one to get the ball rolling on this guy. Way to go cops, way to go mom!
Good work Mom!
"HE ACTUALLY GOOGLED ""HOW TO CONDUCT A SCHOOL SHOOTING"" LMAOOOOO  CAN YOU IMAGINE?"
Just think, one little thing he did that day might have prevented him from leaving right before the cops got there. He could have wasted just enough time on his phone while taking a shit.
You're not fucking kidding.  >Local and state police followed the mom’s tip, and on Thursday, officers drove to the home of a 20-year-old man named Dylan Jarrell, just as he was leaving his house with more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, a firearm, a 100-round high-capacity magazine, and a “detailed plan of attack.” He was headed toward two school districts in Anderson County and Shelby County, the Kentucky State Police said in a press conference Friday. 
Also kudos to the police taking this seriously. How many times have we heard about people reporting suspicious activity to the police who write it off but then tragedy happened.
"Something about that name ""Dylan"" that creates a mental picture of just .. *unstable*. I knew two Dylan's throughout school, both had some sort of malfunction (late 80's / early 90's)."
See, we don't need armed guards at schools, we just need moms at every entrance
"This part confused the hell out of me.  Do people really Google shit like this so often that some kind of red flag doesn't go off.  I just always figured if I Googled ""How to make a bomb"", ""Where to buy bomb ingredients"", and ""Good bomb targets"" the FBI would show up.  Edit: I get it all, there are plenty of rational reasons to Google these terms.   I just figured Googling multiple phrases similar to these would put you on some sort of list.  Edit 2: No I do not want the government spying on individuals.  I simply thought some deep learning algorithm at Google would connect dots and raise some flags"
Buzzfeed’s “Top 10 School Shooting Tips!” It’s honestly such a bizarre thing to search for. I wonder what even comes up? (I’m not going to try though). 
She has a time machine?!? 
Except if you stopped Hitler, you’d never truly understand the magnitude of what you did.  In fact, you could be unknowingly stopping the next Hitler right now just by holding the door open for someone, saying a friendly “hello”, or kicking that pregnant woman down the stairs.   I’m not recommending the last one, though.  
Man, imagine how confused this guy must have been when the cops rolled up.... 
What’s to stop him from doing this when he gets out? I mean for me, a detailed plan for assaulting a school and killing innocent children, just the premeditation of that alone is enough for me to say put him locked away for life. I’m thinking he’s even more angry he caught got and is just going to wait until he’s released to try and carry this out again and because he didn’t get to do anything he’ll get a lenient sentence.  I’m all for rehabilitation, but some people are just lost causes, i mean how sick do you have to be to actually go through with this instead of getting help with and is there any coming back? I don’t know what to think honestly
Send her a gift, she can’t be hard to find
Or from death, even!
That’s exactly what the cops didn’t do in the Parkland shooting. 18 phone calls, online threats made using his own name, and verifiable reports of self harm, yet they sat on their asses
That was the most unbelievable part of it.  I suspect it was because there had been previous complaints about the guy making threats.  He may well have been on some sort of list somewhere. 
"""there's no room for this kind of hate in my world""  Love it. Good on you officer. "
Conspiracy to murder is 100% a crime
This guy had more than one reason to be in school.
I'm a writer. If they flagged every shady thing I googled to get facts straight, I'd be getting questioned weekly.
The woman had screenshots of the guy messaging her and wishing “terrible things” on her children and calling them the N-word. It wasn’t just some sketchy guy walking past, minding his own business.  
The government has no right to that level of intrusion nor should an isp.
Scarily true
Or just the whole, sending a racist message about someone’s kids on Facebook the day before he planned to do it. 
>He could have wasted just enough time on his phone while taking a shit.  So you're saying Reddit stopped a school shooter? WE DID IT, REDDIT!!!
We really need to stop making these pieces of shit into celebrities. People plaster the cunt's name all over the internet and the TV then wonder why this keeps happening...
I don't know what you think law enforcement in general does but tips like this are exactly what allows them to make a big difference. Without tips from the public all police work is near impossible.
The FBI can't make connection on who has been stockpiling guns and ammo because it's illegal to keep firearm records in computers in the United States.  Think about that, it is illegal to have a database of firearms.  That's the simplest law to change. It's also an absolute no brainer that all but the most nutty of gun nuts would not only accept but support.  EDIT: to all the gun nuts saying a database can only ever be used for future confiscation: every terrorist who has committed a school shooting conforms to a buying pattern that we could spot if we had a database of gun sales. Your assertion that they don't is entirely unfounded because ATF cannot use computers.
> “I spoke to Officer Josh Satterly, who told me, ‘There’s no room for this kind of hate in my world,” she says. “He took me seriously.”  THAT is how you police.
It’s not always the case though. Detectives, social workers, parole officers all have pretty big case loads. They can’t investigate every lead.  The cops you see day to day goofing around in patrol are doing just that; patrolling. They’re first responders. They don’t get bogged down with investigations because then there’d be no one around when you call 911. 
>“He had the tools necessary, the intent necessary. And the only thing that stood between him and evil … is law enforcement,”  \- Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders  Like a goddamn script from a movie!
One of the Columbine shooters was named Dylan
My name is Dylan :( 
What about abuelas with chanclas?    Beat the shit outta shooters
He’s an adult.
so you can go to the range, have a bunch of malfunctions and never reload your gun.
[This case](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilberto_Valle) is pretty interesting. A guy had an online identity where he talked about kidnapping and raping real women. He searched how to do various things like chloroform a girl. He was charged with the conspiracy and convicted by the jury, but he judge threw out the case. An appeals court later upheld the judges decision. Basically, seeking info or planning in words only isn’t enough to consider it an imminent threat of an actual crime. It’s a fine line between freedom of speech and protecting people from crime, but I can understand the courts ruling. Simply having thoughts, curiosity, or a fantasy about something isn’t equal to planning to carry them out.   Now, actually buying supplies or taking it further than words on the internet is something much different. 
"> ""Good bomb targets""  Why would you even bother? Where do you expect to get results for this from? Buzzfeed's next article ""Top 10 Bombing Targets Terrorists Salivate Over""? It's the same with:  > ""How to conduct a school shooting""  ...was he expecting an eHow article on this?"
It was the choice of Steins;Gate. 
Oops too late
"""So remember that random women on fb you called the n bomb?..."""
Those are felony charges so he will not legally be able to own guns. But this is where the argument that there are plenty of illegal ways to own a gun comes into play and he probably will find one. Or use something else instead. Let's just hope the system gets him some help and some how fixes this man although I'm doubtful.
Were you home when the police came? What's the neighborhood been like?
I honestly hope she’s not too easy to find, since she just thwarted this crazy dudes plan. And really really hope no one posts her address even with good intentions. 
It’s still technically a lifetime if they died...   ...I’m going to hell, god damnit.
"That could have been a factor here too. After that happened I bet cops are taking ""might shoot up a school"" tips way more seriously."

"[Attempted Murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder) perhaps.  ""In the United States, attempted murder is an inchoate crime. A conviction for attempted murder requires a demonstration of an intent to murder, meaning that the perpetrator either tried to murder and failed (e.g. attempted to shoot the victim and missed or shot the victim and the victim survived) **or took a substantial step towards committing a murder (e.g. purchasing a gun or other deadly weapon and writing about his or her intent to kill).**"" From Wikipedia, bolds mine.

To be fair, you’re probably on multiple watchlists because of that activity.
Truly scary
Hateful people tend to also be stupid.
Once more our unparalleled ability to keep people on the shitter is the silent hero
"Well, to be fair, during their press conference, the Kentucky State Police pointedly *refused to name him* and even explained that it was to keep him from becoming famous.  It's a fine line: the news needs to report. Imagine the Oklahoma City bombing and then being told by all news agencies that we couldn't learn the terrorist's name but that we should just ""trust"" law enforcement they got the right guy.  Can you imagine any decent American settling for that? To just trust both the police and govt that they got it right but we shouldn't ask questions as to who did it, and why? *Fuck* no!  At the same time, in talking to the news, *people* like those in law enforcement, or this woman who called it in, don't have to say his name over and over."
No kidding that’s what I got out of this. A police officer doing his job correctly and not standing for racist bullshit.
All might irl
Wait, wouldn’t that be who came when the mom called 911 then?
Well that’s taking away pretty much all the credit from the one actually responsible for him being stopped.

I think that makes sense. The first thing that came to mind was an author doing research for a fictional story. A lot of that stuff isn't exactly common knowledge.. 
Yeah, if we arrested everyone who googled suspect phrases most fiction writers would be in jail.
OKARIIIIN
Thank you for stopping Hitler 2
“Looks like your racist tantrum, Dylan,”  *puts on sunglasses*  “Blew up in your face”
I doubt the school shooter has an elaborate organization just waiting for this ladies address so she can get clapped for this lol she saved a thousand kids 
Bring snacks
You expect too much. Most people here are reacting to the headline and didn't realize she had tangible evidence to provide the police. Calling it a gut feeling is dishonest and does a disservice to the mom. She made an informed decision to report him. 
"Is anyone else thinking about the kind of world we live in that stopping a school shooting is uplifting news? I'm glad it was stopped, but I'm heartbroken that this is the norm.  Notes:  1. ""World"" as I wrote it means America, not the whole planet.  2. The term ""uplifting"" means different things to different people, no need to be rude/disrespectful sharing opinions. 3. ""Norm"" is another term regarding personal perspective which is not indicative of everyone's upbringing, circumstances, or societal views.  Can we agree that being nice to each other is actually 100% uplifting?"
In most other countries the person wouldn’t be named until sentenced. Because if a person is found not guilty, that person’s life is ruined regardless.   And media wouldn’t even report the name unless it was serious crime. There’s no reason anyone getting caught for speeding, marijuana, public urination etc should have their name in the paper. The records are open though so If you have an interest in a particular case you can always go to the courthouse. But no one ever bothers with that.
There's a fine line, sure. But there's also a logical middle ground. Anyone who wants to know his name should be able to search it. But his name shouldn't be in every news cast either. There should be a period of identification, and then a period of stating facts only. You could regulate this with enough time and money.
"In a lot of cases though, what can you do?  Angsty teens gonna angst, and if no actual crime has yet been committed... we aren't Minority Report (yet).  All the future-evidence in the world may not be enough to justly lock up an innocent person.  And with the way various mental health conditions are treated in most places, there's hardly an answer to be found there, either.  Especially if the individuals are unwilling.  Forcing people to do things they don't want to do is a slippery slope and it's hard to practice without stepping all over people.  edit - to clarify a few things, I'm talking about (as stated..) **in a lot of cases**.  I'm referring explicitly to the cases where there isn't all that evidence, where there are only hints of impending problems.  Where you CAN'T just say ""they were making terroristic threats and bought weapons and ammo"".  There is obviously a line somewhere, and it's not easy to tell in advance what it is, at least not without being willing to step on some 'innocent' (or rather, not-ultimately-going-to-inflict-harm) individuals along the way.  Holding people accountable for things is great, and might shift the line in one direction or another, but it's still not an *answer*.  Fining people who threaten others should already be done, but it's not a hard link between that and committing acts of violence, and THAT'S what I'm referring to.  Fining a teenager for threatening people does not stop them from ultimately following through on it.  It could possibly if it led to increased monitoring/reduced rights for that individual, but again... there's that slope."

We did it Reddit!
Google it, they're really not that difficult to find. Shit, cops sell off surplus supplies and you can just really get anything.
"And it could also be some random person seeing their neighbor bringing some weird chemicals to their house and being like ""huh, I wonder what he's doing..."" and possibly finding a thread or forum saying the ingredients could be used for explosives and then the person googling further to confirm before calling the cops, since not everyone is willing to make a fool out of themselves when it turns out the neighbor is just doing or helping their kid or friend with chemistry homework...  I can think of dozen reasons why someone would Google this and one or two of them would be to make a bomb in order to harm people. But even then, you can't just go on one thread or forum, you'd need multiple and possibly help and it would generally narrow the thing down. And even then it could just be a writer or someone doing research for the hell of it.   And if we went down the road of ""how to make explosives"" being enough to convict, then we might as well include people buying fertilizer... Since that can be blown up. And that would mean tons of people would be on a list and maybe 0.1% of them would have had a thought of ""huh, I wonder if this can be blown up..."""

I don't even read headlines. I just go into comments and react to other things like old people do on Facebook
Hemingway was on a list because he lived in Cuba during the Cold War and had many Cuban Diplomats as close friends. Not because of his Google searches.
It's not the norm, and it's ridiculous to think that it is. It's uplifting news because we avoided a potentially massive loss of life. 
? When is stopping a catastrophe ever not uplifting news...
Absolute madness
And Dylan Pickles, who goes by Dil.  Gets his brother Tommy into all sorts of trouble, never once apologizes or takes any blame.
There's really no such thing as *a* list. It's more like a blob of information containing your search and web history combined with things like religion, sexual preferences, porn habits, ethnicity, place of birth, the amount of Facebook friends / family / work friends you have and what their 'blobs' contain, and so on. Everything you do or say is potentially relevant.      If certain patterns emerge in your 'blob' you get flagged. Sometimes it can be as simple as being a certain age, traveling alone without a fixed destination.       Example: Years ago I flew from the Netherlands to Sweden alone, with no fixed destination as I was planning on backpacking and camping out in the wild. That combined with The Netherlands being the worlds #1 producer of synthetic drugs probably made them check me on arrival in Sweden. As in, I was the only passenger that was stopped and the only one to have to empty their backpack. Of course I didn't smuggle anything, but this gives you some idea of how these things work.

When you’re trying to sound deep on Reddit
Thank you! I have been trying to explain this to my mom forever! During the Casey Anthony case where she chloroformed her daughter, I couldn't remember which house hold chemicals created it I looked it up on the computer. My mom was curious about how she had made it, but was freaking out because I looked it up. I knew it was bleach and something else because, I actually paid attention in chemistry class. The amount of arguing ensued was insane. I like chemistry. Hear me list makers! Chemistry is cool! 😆  Edit: Not even mad mods at the censure, wrong info in the wrong hands and what not. But the comment ghosting is getting out of hand. 
So you too have googled it
Just so you know, even though what you said will keep getting falsely propagated, there are fewer school shootings and *significantly* fewer gun-related deaths in schools than even 20 years ago.  The difference now is the impact is greater due to how big mass-media has gotten.  https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593831564/the-disconnect-between-perceived-danger-in-u-s-schools-and-reality
"It's not ""fair to the mods"" to hide a basic fact. It's stupid and nonsensical censorship.  It's on the wiki page, this isn't rocket surgery: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform  >**Inadvertent formation of chloroform**   >The haloform reaction can also occur inadvertently in domestic settings. Bleaching with hypochlorite generates halogenated compounds in side reactions; chloroform is the main byproduct.[26] Sodium hypochlorite solution (chlorine bleach) mixed with common household liquids such as acetone, butanone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethanol, or isopropyl alcohol can produce some chloroform, in addition to other compounds such as chloroacetone or dichloroacetone.    I dare the mods to remove my post for quoting the wiki page. :) You might be afraid of them, I'm not."
Chance's tots.
Dont know much about the guy but the more I hear about him, the more I like him.
Which is crazy considering his net worth is only $1.9 million
The youth jazz group I'm a part of records an album every year and last year when we went to the studio Chance kicked us out to record but to make it up he paid for our recording time. Hell of a nice guy! Edit: can't spell 
Chance is such great (and needed) figure for Chicago. This donation is incredible. Too bad it will likely end up as a drop in the leaky bucket of the disastrous CPS pension fund...  https://www.illinoispolicy.org/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-chicago-teacher-pensions/
Man! I know Chance is a popular artist, but he can't be that rich. 1 million is a very significant portion of his income, that's VERY generous of him. Love this guy 
As much as it is great of him to do this, I fear that the bureaucracy of the Chicago Public Schools will find new and fast ways to waste this money and line the pockets of Administration Cronies.
I am a student at Chicago Public Schools and I am so thankful for his generous donation.
I genuinely give this guy props for doing this but HE SHOULD NOT FUCKING HAVE TO DONATE SHIT. THERE IS ZERO REASON THAT ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL SHOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE UNITED STATES.  
And CPS will find a way to waste it all on 'administrative costs'. Money probably would've helped the kids moreso had it been donated to the teachers' GoFundMe (or whatever the k-12 equivalent is) pages. Kinda like what our based Hawkeye Ashton Kutcher did for the Iowa schools.  Good on Chance for doing this regardless though, his heart is in the right place.
Hey mister Chance, whatcha gonna do? Watcha gonna do? Make our dreams come true!

You're gonna give me PTSD. I love The Office but that episode makes me feel like I need to drink   No show of any series I've seen has ever produced such a visceral feeling of guilt 
Lil Chano's lil chanos
You should check out his music. Dude's very uplifting and honestly makes feel good music to me. His actions and his music line up well in my eyes.
"I figured he'd be too ""nice"" to be frank about the problems with Governor Rauner.  I'm impressed he isn't just hiding those problems, or pretending that criticizing someone who is in a political office is ""too political"" but he's correctly making it clear that the guy is part of the problem, not the solution.  Next election for the office is 2018 and there are a lot of people lining up to run against him, so we should have a strong candidate to pull Illinois back from going down the path of Wisconsin, Michigan or Kansas."
Yup. All I know is he's a fantastic human being.  Same with the wrestler guy.... Oh John Cena.  I know he's a good wrestler (or fighter or something), but most of what I've seen is him being fucking tremendously giving with children, both sick and healthy children, who are fans of his.  I fucking LOVE John Cena and I have never liked any fighting/wrestling sports.    Hockey players do tons for kids and it only gets noticed if they're a big time name, I'm sure other pro sports are similar.
Maybe money doesn't concern him
Net worth estimations are complete horseshit 
Not trying to take away from him because he's doing an amazing thing, but from what I've heard he comes from a pretty affluent family in the Chicago area so he may have some family money to throw towards it as well. 
What do you mean by kick you out?
"the real ""uplifting news"" is always in the comments"
"Not trying to shit on Ye but it's like Chance is becoming the rapper for Chi-town Kanye was supposed to become back in the day. Remember when Kanye was known for Jesus Walks? I thought he was going to be the ""mainstream Christian rapper.""  Love that Chance is using his $ for stuff like this and love his music. Hope he keeps bringing it for years to come."
1 million is his net worth, this is super generous

I just started listening last week, it's really good! Love the track Angels
"Specifically Acid Rap. So Good is my jam.   EDIT: lmao some of yall need to chill. Chance literally has the MV labeled as [""So Good (Good Ass Intro)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjmiLp47Yg8) on his YouTube channel. "
Probably this. He gets to do what he loves without any restriction from record deals, plus his faith in God.
His net worth is much higher than that, but yeah..
"""pretty affluent"" is a massive exaggeration."
I come from a pretty affluent family too... and I'm not donating roughly half of my net worth to anything.    
"Jazz group: ""oh boy! Here we are at the recording studio! You guys all set?! So hyped!""  Chance: ""sorry guys, I'm using the recording studio""   Jazz group: ""aw man!""  Chance: ""it's okay, come back tomorrow, and here's the money to pay for your session, sorry about that!"""
Like Jazz being thrown out of Uncle Phil's.
"Depending on how long, recording time in a studio can get expensive. It was more than the ""bare minimum"" I think."
Or, better yet, have Chicago stop taxing the shit out of every little thing. My guess is you don't live here or you would know better. 
To be fair he turned down something like 10 mil for his next album to stay independent.  Dude just won a Grammy.  He is blowing up and the net worth being reported will be in the 20-30s next year.  Still a huge donation, but let's not kid ourselves, he's not depleting his bank accounts to do this.
Not true! It went to pay raises for directors of programs and other high ranking administrators!   They need it, ok? It's taxing to get paid that much 
Mmmmmm, it's just the *most* delicious cringe. Not even laptops, which they can use, but laptop *batteries*, which are relatively expensive and also totally useless with anything but the one model they're designed for. 
Chance the fullonrapist
"I never even found it to be the ""cringiest"" episode either - the Dinner Party episode with Jan & Michael makes me feel infinitely more awkward."
Check out Noname's only album so far, Telefone; legit as fuck and very collaborative; I discovered her before him and thought Chance sounded like a male Noname. Turns out they're buddies from high school or something. Chi-town baby!
> destroyed are education system  I believe you
I love it when faith in God leads to happiness for self and others around them. Best type of faith. 
Not really. IIRC his father was campaign manager for Rahm Emmanuel. Not really rich but fairly well off and with lots of connections 
I had to pause that episode multiple times because I was cringing so hard. In hindsight after finishing the series I realized that's what I loved most about Michael .
She's on a couple Chance songs like [Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjxjMcLK9U) too.
~~either means~~ Good Ass Intro ~~or Everything's Good~~
Right? If religion was inherently like this, the world could be a better place.  Instead, we have to compete and argue for who's beliefs are best.
9 mil is a lot fucking higher than 1.9 million...
There's whole threads about people not being able to watch that episode.  I didn't mind it at all.  To me it's just as cringeworthy, in a good way, as [Jan dancing to Hunter's jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H8Gcvkqwjk).
Religion will still always weird me out, though. But yeah, coolcool.  Edit: Why the fuck did i write this on my phone, while i'm sitting in front of my PC, being in the same thread? If God is real, you did something wrong with me, man.
Religion is inherently like this, dicks fuck it up tho so it gets a bad rap. My mom's church does lots of real good but only the bad shit gets reported 
It's 1. higher

I met Gavel the other month when doing electrical work on site. I was wondering why there was a German Shepherd bouncing around a government building haha. Big and cuddly. I thoroughly enjoyed giving him scratches. 
When a dog has better career than you.. 
My boy was left on a leed to rot cause he didn't take to herding sheep. Now he herds little kids, kitty cats, and bunny rabbits.     Edit hearing/herding.   
Sounds like a plot for an animated short.
It's a ruff job market out there, but he seems to have it licked.
My German shepherd Roxy was sacked from the police academy as well. She definitely looked the part (very large, solid black German shepherd) but she just took correction too hard. So we found her at the German Shepherd Rescue and it was love at first sight. She spent the rest of her 12 years guarding my house and being the biggest lover. We lost her in 2012 but I think about her all the time and how happy I am she flunked out of the police academy. RIP Roxy ❤️  Edit: So much love for Roxy! Here's a picture of her!  [Here she is!](https://imgur.com/gallery/cEsW7) 
"I'm hearing the voice of Doug from *UP!* in my head:    ""I am a police dog! I am so happy to protect and serve. I was trained in an academy to- SQUIRREL!- help people who need help. I am very helpful!"""
I had a German Shepherd growing up that failed police dog school because he was too playful. He would bark but never bite so they sent him to the pound and was going to be put down before we found him. Ended up being the best dog ever.
If he can do it! So can I! Im gunna become a greeter for Wal-Mart! LOOKOUT WORLD!
He should get severance unless they fired him for paws 
How do you explain to a dog that it's fired?
The university I teach at has a service dog training program.  Every term, several students bring in puppies to lecture as the fuzzballs get accustomed to being in public and performing their tasks.  Every so often, I have the pleasure of watching a puppy grow up into a wonderful pet for the student rather than a professional.    It's a win-win for me because puppies are **much** better behaved in class than humans, and even if they fail out of the program, I sometimes get to see them again in office hours.

A Witness! To the top with you!
I wonder where he sleeps at night and stuff. 
Remember that one kid that was benched to put Airbud on the court.
My dog was fired from sheepherding because he ate a goose.
I have a pure bred chocolate lab because he was supposed to be a hunting dog. Turns out he is terrified of loud noises like gun shots. And birds. And--what the hell was that noise over there? Makes a good foot warmer though. 
dog dreams of politics  dog tries his best at security, giving up on his dreams  dog gets fired one day and feels real blue  no. i will chase my dreams.  *becomes dog president*
I can see it. Animated dog can't become a cop, becomes greeter, is in a position to stop a crime and does. Then ultimately decides to stay a greeter?! 
You'd have to be barking mad to fire this pooch
Please be my prisoner! 
Hi, I just met you, and I love you! 
Nowadays I'm seeing the friendlier dogs recycled for bomb or food sniffing dogs and community policing mascots. They dont get fired so much anymore
Sounds like something Mr. Peanutbutter would say. 
I'm also from Brisbane (the ~~town~~ city in Australia) where this has happened. It is most certainly a real thing :)   
I'll see if I can find a photo. I send my girlfriend pics of all the puppies I encounter at work to brighten up her day. 
The property he lives on is huge in an inner city suburb, A big mansion (the governors mansion) with multiple other buildings, guard huts, etc. I'm sure he lives a life of comfort and has a big fluffy bed.

"We had a border collie growing up that was a rejected sheepdog.  For some reason, he associated trees with herding.  We could yell ""GO PLAY"" (command to start herding) and he would run and jump up the nearest tree and nip at the branches.  He even bit and hung off of them once.  He was a weird dog."
/r/tifu
My roommate's beagle is like that.  She's scared of EVERYTHING.  Even runs if a plastic bag blows across the yard, and of course doesn't like loud noises.  She never barks or howls, but will whimper if you don't pay attention to her.  Oddest beagle I've ever known.

Some dogs are too sensitive and will shut down when corrected rather than continuing to function but without the bad behavior. 
I can see how that convo went down with the chief:  Chief: come on in, and take a seat. Sit...  Dog: what's this abork?   Chief: I need you to tell me one thing: Who is a good boy?  Dog: Well I'm a good boy.   Chief: Exactly, and for that reason we need you to turn in your leash and vest.  Dog: bork What?   Chief: well, you ARE a good boy...but you're a little TOO good. 
To the top you go!
> If a comcast technician can cut the cable clearly going into my apartment and still has a job.. I can too  You could start cutting _other people's_ cables and become a job creator.
I love this dog, even though i have never met him. He has pride and a good work ethic.   Just the wrong demographic for his unique skills!
"underrated comment of the day ""what's this abork?"""
I pointed out Australia on a map once. It's legit
It´s was not the wrong ones.  He did allright. Have you ever seen a tree run a way? No. Because he keeps them in line. ;) 
Basically that's exactly it. Police dogs have to be able to be yelled at, hit, and attacked and still want to go (because that's what bad guys will do to them) so if they can't take being corrected then they'll freeze up on the job and get hurt.

Hey Mr. chance! What you gonna do, what you gonna do, make our dreams come true!
I am not a rap fan at all...but kudos to this guy...I think I'll go buy something of his (eg music, etc)..  Or maybe donate a few dollars to a school charity in Chicago in his name...yeah..that might be a better idea
Guy is all class
Kudos to this guy. Backpacks are among the most expensive school supplies that are typically deemed necessary.   EDIT - Huh. Backpacks aren't a dollar or two in stores where I live. I do wish they were, though. I've had mine for years and it was $25. 
Backpack rapper
Every other rapper says be humble.   Chance takes that shit very seriously.  edit: I'm not talking about Kendrick. It's great you guys like him but holy shit he's not the first person to ever say be humble or stay humble.
He is very deserving of the fame and wealth he's attained. He sincerely is just trying to make difference. His music spreads a positive message as well. A damn good guy, I hope that those of you who have not listened to any of his music yet find the time to do so
I loved Coloring Book. Glad he is able to give back to the community and help people from his hometown after becoming famous.
What I'm curious about, is how he makes so much money that he's able to donate all the time?  Don't get me wrong, this is fantastic and I love Chance's music and charity work, but if he gives his music out for free, does his income generate simply from his concerts and sponsorships?   Cheers!
Chano for mayor
I don't like his music at all but I really appreciate all the good work he's doing. I'd also imagine kids receiving the backpacks could start looking up to him which is great cause the dude is an awesome example.
He could give them all laptop batteries. 
r/cantwatchscottstots
His music is free, he doesn't sell it.
Generally speaking I am not a fan of the genre but he seems like a really cool guy that is personally invested in his community and fans. I totally respect him for that and if his actions spark more people to help others out then I respect him even more.   https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/5xvpc4/chance_the_rapper_announces_1_million_donation_to/  https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/5wcy51/chance_the_rapper_rents_out_chicago_theater_to/  https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/51z8k1/chance_the_rapper_bought_almost_2000_scalper/  
Buy some merch, go see a show or donate to one of the charities he supports. This man is the blueprint for a real man! 
Always in the hallway so I never been classy
"I'm fucking loving this movement where hip-hop artists are starting to give back to the community. The whole ""I made it from nothing and now I'm a baller"" shit is so outdated. "
Guy is no sass
Anyone who needs a backpack for cheap, the Everest brand on Amazon is super cheap ~$12. I used it to bike in the Florida heat for my delivery job. 2 years of sweat, sun, rain. And the zippers held, and no holes. Its a solid pack
They sell them for £1 in Pound shops around back to school time. Not bad quality either, just not brand name. 
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick. 
Then how come Kendrick and chance haven't done a song together ? Rhetorical but this needs to happen 
It was okay, Acid Rap and 10 day really made him worth while.
Probably giving a bit of context. As in he seems to be a genuinely good person, coming from a person who isn't a dickrider.   Also, probably chill the fuck out.
Merch
I'm thinking maybe I should 
Hold on! They are Lithium!
The tots part makes it hard to watch, but I love the employee of the month part so much
Fuck that, he's gonna take my money and he's gonna like it
And he doesn't have a deal. So how does he make so much money?
Every genre has good music! Just have to find it. Chance is great and unique in the hip hop world. Things like this just make him even more of a role model in the industry. You should give his latest album a listen! :)
username checks out
Yeah. It's cool that Snoop funds local soccer teams(or maybe it was little league baseball instead. Idk the details) and that Kendrick recently bought a disabled fan a van converted to be driveable for them. Even Schoolboy Q has been doing well. Idk about any personal donations to charities but I do know based on his Snapchat story that he's always there for his daughter. Seems like a lot of rappers either understand how PR works or are just stand up guys. I don't even care which it is as long as people benefit. 
Thanks. Sick of buying $60 brand name backpacks that only last a year of light abuse on a college campus. 
I don't know in which pound shop you're finding back packs 
The $10-15 ones at Walmart are absolutely shit quality and fall apart within weeks. A backpack to last all year or longer is around $40. 
I do me like a gyno chick
'No songs with Kendrick, we just hang out.'
Plus tours and all the advertising he does.
well that changes everything
I've seen the Office over 10 times (I know 🙁) and always skip Scott's Tott's and I finally rewatched, it was incredible. I had forgotten what else happened in that episode. It was so refreshing. 
Hey it's me, your rapper
Sponsors and shows/touring, plus he is streaming The Coloring Book on Spotify. 
Basically he's not signed to a label which is why they all resent him and try to destroy his career. He is independent because he wants no restrictions on his music and so he can connect with his audience.  The money he makes through touring and merchandise. The merchandise is on the pricier side but can you blame him? Its not super expensive as if he's selling versace but I'd say the average price for a piece of merchandise is $30-40. He's not on his own tour right now but he does do events, some free charity ones and recently a few with other artists (Life is Beautiful) with blink-182, Lorde etc. 
Hey look at this kid. He stole a balloon on free balloon day!
He has a youth football league. It has actually produced several NFL players.  Unfortunately though, he hangs out with convicted [felons.](http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5846ef52e02ba79f028b7a53/how-a-strange-cooking-show-with-snoop-dogg-and-martha-stewart-became-a-surprise-tv-hit.jpg)
Only you can stop backpack abuse, for only £2.99 a month you could save thousands of innocent baggies.
And $10 (on top of everything else a child/student needs) is a lot of money for a lot of people.

Usually, you have to take these breakthrough articles with a grain of salt because the solution is almost never cost-effective or feasibly efficient. In this case, the key is that it IS efficient, which is why this is looking like a big deal. Amazing work.

Wow! I could finally stop donating my precious O- every few months. Nah, I like the cookies and juice too much, oh and that awesome feeling that I might’ve just saved someone’s life.
Way to go University of British Columbia!
"Wait. Today i learn: my blood type is universal and can be used for anyone. Does this mean i should donate regularly? I actually thought O was super common and just a ""generic"" blood type. Is it helpful if i go donate or doesn't really mean anything?"
O Canada - Canada’s national anthem  O blood - Canada’s new national blood type
I think you misspelled “hundreds of millions”
Bloody brilliant!
Does it say anywhere, or does anybody know, how long it will be until this is wide spread??  I know there is a huge shortage of blood in Ontario for example, I always get calls from GiveBlood being desperate for more donors - this will help SO MUCH.
For anyone unaware, RT is Russia Today.  It's a state-owned-and-operated propaganda outlet.  ITT: *But wuddabout...!?!?!*
What a bro
I’m afraid you still might have to continue donating blood because this does not account for the Rh antigen. So people with Rh negative blood groups (especially those with O- such as yourself) will continue requiring your blood for transfusion. Also I don’t think the technique mentioned will work for conversion between Rh+ and Rh- simply because the Rh antigen is an integral membrane protein.
Way to go Canada!! 🙌
You should definitely consider donating regularly! O- is a universal donor - that means that anyone can use your blood. Also, other O- people can only accept transfusions from O- donors.   Until this amazing breakthrough, that is.
Yeah, it'll maybe ease my guilt a bit - since I went on bp meds I can't donate, but they keep calling me.  UPDATE: Many thanks to u/abbypaigeallen for encouraging me to check my assumptions on this - as it turns out, I am eligible. According to the nurse I just talked to, most bp meds are fine, as long as bp measures OK on the day of donation. If you're also just assuming (like I did) that your prescription meds disqualify you, take a few mins to inquire - you may be surprised to find that you're still eligible!
British Columbia is in Canada.
RT mixes real news with blatant propaganda, using journalists and reporters you all know and love. It's designed to cripple people's ability to tell truth from fiction, amongst other things. It's really, really, really difficult to avoid being affected by it, so it's better to just not read it.  It's like the Daily Mail, but sinister.
it is a great day for Canada and therefore, the world.
I’m a phlebotomist in the US and I’m surprised by the fact that you can’t donate on BP meds. Usually as long as you aren’t taking it for any cardiac problems and just to regulate your BP it’s fine.
RT produces lots of true, negative things about the US. They can actually be a good counterpoint to US talking points. But then RT publishes stuff like this  [https://www.rt.com/news/360946-mh17-ukraine-fabricate-evidence/](https://www.rt.com/news/360946-mh17-ukraine-fabricate-evidence/)  which is just verbatim russian government disinformation and complaining. They really amp up the propaganda when it comes to Ukraine and EU and Germany.
Oh...  So, it’s like Fox News?
I'm O-. Used to give often when i was 18-21, but these days I struggle to donate. I get nauseous and faint, i sweat bullets. They struggle to find a vein, and then struggle to poke it. I would happily donate every 2-3 months if i could do it without the pain and anxiety.
RT makes Fox News pundits look ‘fair and balanced’.   It’s an arms length Putin propaganda media company.
"RT is absolutely worse than Fox News.  But let's not pretend that Fox News is anything but a Republican run propaganda media company.  In fact, the man who ran Fox News from its inception - Roger Ailes - came up with the idea back in the 1970s. You know what he called his plan?  ""The Plan to Get the GOP on TV News"""
This makes me so glad. They have been the most stunning thing for me, of all stunning things exhibited there.
That's amazing and really great news.  As sad as this fire is, the fact is that history and tragedy go hand in hand. Notre Dame still stands and will be repaired. Yes we've lost a lot of history, but we also just witnessed it. In another 900 years this fire will be an important a part of Notre Dame's history, the art and architecture done to repair it will be valued just as highly as what we lost yesterday. The world still has Notre Dame.
Haunting new photos of Notre Dame's interior reveal how it survived the inferno after it was revealed three of its iconic Rose Windows escaped damage, as detectives probe the renovation work which may have led to the blaze.  The pictures revealed the golden crucifix and altar were preserved amongst the smouldering rubble after the roof was destroyed by Monday night's fire.  Three 'irreplaceable' Rose Windows, which date to the 13th century and were last night feared to have melted or exploded, were intact.  Attention has now turned to what may have caused Notre Dame, part of which was being restored in a €150million refurbishment, to fall victim to such a disaster.  The focus of prosecutors is currently on contractors Le Bras Freres, whose owner Julien Le Bras last year boasted his firm's goal was 'to keep as many old items as possible and not to put the building at risk' after they were awarded a €5.7m (£5m, $6.5m) contract as part of the cathedral's restoration project.   Detectives investigating the catastrophic blaze are today interviewing specialist restorers who were carrying out works on the cathedral spire when the inferno broke out.  French police are understood to have launched a criminal inquiry after a 'stray flame' caused fire to engulf the landmark last night, with heroic firefighters battling for eight hours to bring the blaze under control.  The Paris prosecutor's office is probing 'involuntary destruction caused by fire', indicating authorities are treating the blaze as a tragic accident and not arson or terrorism.  'Nothing suggests that it was a voluntary act,' Remy Heitz told reporters outside the Gothic cathedral, adding that the workers employed at the site were being questioned over Monday's blaze.    Some of its 200 specialist employees were working at the site where the fire is thought to have originated, the cathedral's 300ft-tall wooden and lead spire, which collapsed in front of crowds of horrified Parisians at 8pm.   A source close to the inquiry said that many of the restorers had been interviewed overnight, with prosecutors focusing on the equipment used at the 850-year-old cathedral, where light and power sources were limited.  In such circumstances, hordes of cables and wires would have to be attached to dozens of generators, which would then be hoisted high up on to medieval building.   'The fear is that a small fire began in the rood where they were working,' the source added.   'The irony is that the restorers had just begun working on the spire which collapsed along with much of the roof.'  Le Bras Freres is one of the most respected companies of its kind in France, and last year finished a widespread restoration programme of Reims Cathedral in the east of the country.     The firm had won the €5.7million contract to restore the Notre Dame spire, which was designed by the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and erected in 1859.  They were due to be on site for up to four years along with Europe Scaffolding, another company which had just put 250 tons of scaffolding around Notre Dame, along with a lift that could move up and down the 300ft spire.  On Tuesday morning, Julien Le Bras, the chief executive of the Bras Brothers, said he had no initial comment to make in regards to the inquiry.  The blaze, which broke out as the last crowds of tourists ended visits at around 7pm, was finally declared to be 'fully extinguished' at about 9.45am this morning.  As the fire raged, brave rescue teams raced to recover what treasures they could from the Gothic masterpiece, which housed priceless artefacts and relics of huge religious and international significance.  Among them was the reputed Crown of Thorns, supposedly worn by Jesus during his crucifixion, which was carried to safety by a human chain of emergency service workers.   Today the Archbishop of Paris told BFM-TV that the three beautiful rose windows on the north, west and south sides of the church had all survived intact.   Fears had grown for the 'really irreplaceable' stained-glass windows, dating back to the 13th century, amid the heat of the fire last night.   The status of other relics, including a purported piece of the Cross on which Jesus was crucified, remained unclear today.   French priest Jean-Marc Fournier led the efforts to save the  Crown of Thorns.   Etienne Loraillere, an editor for France's KTO Catholic television network, said Father Fournier 'went with the firefighters into Notre Dame Cathedral to save the Crown of Thorns and the Blessed Sacrament'.  This was confirmed by an emergency services source who said: 'Father Fournier is an absolute hero.  'He showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the Cathedral, and made sure they were saved. He deals with life and death every day, and shows no fear.'  More than 400 firemen were needed to tame the inferno that consumed the roof and collapsed the spire of the eight-centuries-old cathedral. They worked through the night to bring the fire under control some 14 hours after it began.  One firefighter was injured; no one else was reported hurt in the blaze which began after the building was closed to the public for the evening.    Shortly after the the blaze broke out, French fashion mogul Francois-Henri Pinault, the husband of Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100million euros (£86 million) towards the restoration effort.   Hours later, French billionaire Bernard Arnault announced that his family and his LVMH luxury goods group would donate 200million euros to help with repairs.   French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild the cathedral, whatever the cost.   He said in a speech outside the church: 'We will appeal to the greatest talents and we will rebuild Notre-Dame because that's what the French are waiting for, because that's what our history deserves, because it's our deepest destiny.'   Pope Francis said Tuesday he hoped everyone would pull together to rebuild the devastated Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris following a massive fire.  'I hope the Notre-Dame cathedral may once again become, thanks to reconstruction work and the mobilization of all, a jewel in the heart of the city,' Francis said in a statement issued by the Vatican.  Leaders from around the world offered their condolences to France. Among them was Queen Elizabeth II, who said: 'Prince Philip and I have been deeply saddened to see the images of the fire which has engulfed Notre-Dame Cathedral.  'I extend my sincere admiration to the emergency services who have risked their lives to try to save this important national monument.  'My thoughts and prayers are with those who worship at the Cathedral and all of France at this difficult time.'    Notre Dame had previously the site of a terror scare in 2016 when a car carrying seven gas cylinders was found near the cathedral.   Three women were arrested over the alleged terror plot, although they were thought to have been targeting a Paris railway station rather than the cathedral itself.   Police have made clear today that they believe Monday night's fire was an accident.
Fuck this article on mobile..  some video keeps opening up.
Damn... There's a picture of the CEO of the construction company and a picture of his wife and children in this article.  This already isn't going to go well for him or his company.  Kind of setting him up to be hurt by giving the crazies these pictures.
Awesome! What a huge relief!
Thank god. There’s still plenty more priceless artworks that are still unknown as to their condition, but at least the windows were saved. I heard that the organ, which sits under one of the three windows, was also spared from the fire. As an art major, this has been an incredibly tense day or so as we wait for more news. Hopefully we get more updates like this in regards to the other works.  Edited to correct timeframe.
"I ain't religious, but I think, ""Thank God,"" is appropriate here."
This is great news. I was heartbroken to hear the news yesterday.  I have a 4-6 week trip in Europe planned in August. But now, as someone who has a background in repairing disatster stricken structures(stained glass windows excluded).. I would seriously love to spend my time there to help rebuild/clean up if I can. Assuming it will be going on when I'm in the EU.  Edit:  )  Edit 2: sorry to the people who are upset with my sentiment and hopes at doing something cool. I'm probably letting this get to me more than I should but. I never really held the grand illusion that I would actually be able to be a part of it all. Never should have commented..  Edit 3: Holy wow you all. Thank you for the love and thank you kind stranger for my First Plantnum!!!!! You all really brightened my day!
In a few centuries tour guides will describe this as a miracle.
Architectural preservation and awareness will be a bigger issue now, too.
Thank you. I needed to hear this perspective. Sometimes it's too easy to feel like everything beautiful is burning.
You are a hero. I tried to read the article but so many pop up ads made it impossible.
Welder. It's going to be a welder's fault. Calling it now.
Read this on desktop, adblock stopped 51 ads. Good grief
That's the Daily Mail for you. Damned if I'm giving them an upvote, even though this is some very good news from among the sadness.
it's stained glass, not a relief.
I don't think they'll be looking for volunteers, even with experience. Before touching anything in there, you'd probably need to go through a contractor who has been vetted and knows EU law and regulations when doing that sort of work and furthermore has suitable insurance as there is still significant value in the structure that remains.
They already are. And not without reason. I'm honestly amazed at just how much is still standing after the pictures of the fire yesterday.
For now, the public has been being warned about the cathedral's state for a long time and it took years to get enough funding to even start touching it. It ironically took a fire for them to procure enough money to actually fix the place
Oddly enough the money raised from this fire might actually be enough to restore it properly which was going to be hard to do with how small the budget was before this happened. Some good may still come of this
Buildings are living history, everything that happens becomes a part of the history. Napoleon’s crowning happened at one time, and it’s now become part of the history; every time you visit a landmark you aren’t witnessing the history of that place, you are participating in it  Edit: word choice
Daily Mail Special Notre Dame Edition    Pg. 1 CEO used restoration chemicals that could cause _*cancer*_    Pg. 2 Fox spotted in CEO's neighbourhood - Is he breeding these vicious killers?    Pg. 3 CEO's 9 year old daughter looking all grown up at father's hearing!
Yeah. Without an immediate need for assistance, and the backing of a nation, they are going to have everything they need.
No one died in that fire, including emergency responders trying to save as many priceless artifacts as possible.  There was just one person significantly injured, and that was a firefighter.  I think that alone is staggering.
It looked so bad because all the burning wood fell on top of the vaulted ceiling, which (mostly) held up and kept the interior safe. However, above images couldn't really show that, and it just looked like a giant inferno filling up the entire interior.
NOTRE DAME WAS AN INSIDE JOB is a great movie plot
I hear the Catholic Church has some Euros saved up, too.
> just one person significantly injured, and that was a firefighter  that person should start running for saint
This. Honestly thank god it happened in the evening (and on a weekday at this time of year rather than the height of tourist season), and near the time that Notre Dame closes to the public for the day anyway. Even though from the way it panned out I imagine they would have got everyone out before the spire collapse etc., it must have been far easier to manage the evacuation of both people and artwork/relics because it was a less busy time of day.
George Bush did Notre Dame! Jet fuel can't melt wooden beams! Wait...
Now I wonder who the patron saint for fire fighters is. I know St Michael the Arch Angel is the patron of police and paratroopers, but I'm not sure who the others would be for other first responders.
**GEORGE BUSH DOES NOT CARE ABOUT `Notre Dame`**
St Michael is also the patron saint of paramedics I believe. St Florian is the patron saint of firefighters.

*“When you take a good person who’s down, broken, discouraged, and you give them an opportunity to be proud of their self — to stand up and do something for their self — that’s one of the greatest gifts anybody can give to anybody, and for that, I’d like to say thank you.”*  Restoring a person's pride can turn their whole life around. Good on these people.
It's almost like if you treat a homeless person like a person, you'll find out they just wanna do honest work like everyone else. I'm shocked! Shocked I say!
In OKC we have a local magazine called the curb side chronicle that is 2$ and has really good articles and local artists do the covers. Anyways it's a way for homeless to make money again because it only costs 1$ for them to buy and restock  *Edit it's awesome that so many states do this as well. Helps so many get back on there feet. 
">""Just 57 of the 110 participants who were hired into regular jobs out of the program retained those jobs for more than 90 days."""
Nothing succeeds like success
I handed out blankets to random homeless people in Houston when it was super cold. I had good conversations with most of them. Some have serious mental illnesses that need to be addressed and some just have substance abuse problems. I bought them coffees to warm up and most of them were grateful but one guy just wanted booze which is understandable honestly lol
Denver always seems to be a trailblazer for positive & innovative initiatives. *Skips to computer to look for who’s hiring there*  [Denver & one of their great 1st initiatives 🌳💨](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN13A2YP) 
There was once a point in my friends life where he parents didn't want him at home and friends were fed up with him staying over on couches doing nothing unemployed. The further he fell the harder it was to get a job. Who are we kidding no one would take him.    Do you have a vehicle. No Where's your primary residence. Here and there What's your education. Grade 11 drip out  Its understand able how any company would immediately pass on this employee.    It wasn't until a mutual childhood friend who came into a position where he could hire someone that did finally that, hired this guy and gave him a chance knowing he's got no vehicle and no permanent place to rest his head. He feared our jobless friend would burn a final bridge and that would be that...  Mike, the jobless, homeless guy is still working there 4yrs ish later, NEVER MISSED A DAY, he's renting his own apartment and has completely 180 his life all because one person took a chance on him. Mike is my inspiration.   Now I can't say all homeless people will be like my friend but I would dare say there's a large portion of people lost out there that just DONT KNOW what to do or how to do it and are waiting for that 1 person to take a chance on them. 
Those are the kind of things I like. Not just handing things out, but giving people experience and job opportunities that’ll help them in the future. 
There’s a program in California’s prisons where non-violent offenders can join ‘fire camp’ where they’re trained as firefighters and help fight the wild brush fires.  When they parole they can transition to actual firefighters for the state forestry service.  
Yes. Give a man a fish he eats for a day, teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime. I bet many homeless people are more than willing to work, they just don't have an address to list for an application. On top of that, if you can't shower/shave/wear nice clothes to an interview, who's going to hire you?
Years ago when I volunteered at a homeless shelter helping serve dinner, I had a friend who really didn't get why I did it and thought the whole thing was useless. He said I couldn't make a difference in the person's life with a plate of food - it wouldn't get them a job or solve mental health issues, wouldn't magically turn them into a motivated hard worker, or something.   I told him that if I can hand a plate of food to someone and smile, maybe that smile might brighten their day and show that someone actually cares. Maybe they don't get smiled at a lot, maybe they get treated like shit for sleeping on the streets and not having good hygiene, and maybe this all leads to extremely bad self esteem that makes it even harder to pull yourself out of a rut. But if my smile and a plate of food can give them a little hope, a little strength to hold on one more day, or enough of a sense of worth that over time they manage to take steps towards seeking help in fixing the issues they can, then that plate of food is incredibly valuable.  He didn't really have a good response to that answer.
That may be the case some of the time, but not always if you’re being honest about it. There are quite a few with drug and alcohol addictions, and mental health problems that prevent them from obtaining any sort of work. Just sayin...
We have that here in Denver too! It’s called the Denver Voice.
Seattle has that too and give us back our Sonics
"I think it's weird that that quote starts with ""just.""  I feel like 57 out of 110 is pretty solid.  In my experience one of the main issues with someone who is long term unemployed (which homeless often are), is that they simply lack the skills required to show up on time for a work shift and keep track if when they need to show up.  And it takes a long time to relearn that ability (or learn it for the first time).  "
Teach him how to fish and he gets a ticket from a park ranger or game warden.
"and there's a good documentary that partially covers it on Netflix, called ""Fire Chasers"". Good docu."
Man whatever it takes to get our prison population down. It is such a travesty that we have well over 2 million people in prison which is a larger population than Wyoming and Idaho combined! We have to stop imprisoning people and give them a reason to exist.
Stressed from lack of safe shelter, lack of food security, unreliable transportation, preconceived notions that homeless = lazy/worthless... Hard to find a job, let alone stick with it because of all the problems bearing down on you.   And getting a job is an expense of its own! Suddenly you need to have better clothes, you *need* to wash them more often, you *need* better shoes, not just the shoes that you can tolerate walking and living in as much as necessary. So if you do land a job and can't get your first paycheck in advance and don't want to resort to a scummy payday loan, you're SOL anyway. 
Yet fewer than most think. According to research it's less than 20% that are unwilling or unable.
Severe mental illness and homelessness suck so much. 
"Plus 57 people holding down jobs means 57 less people living in absolute poverty with no income whatsoever.  It's much more than just saying ""well only ~52% success rate!"" because these are people and not medical study statistics."
I'll just chip in, it's not **just** ability. They don't know where they're going to sleep each night or what they're going to eat. They've got no idea how they're going to get their clothes clean or if they'll be able to perform basic heigene. Just the uncertainty of their situation makes it hard to keep a steady job, even if you completely ignore how common addiction and mental illness is in the homeless population.
Started watching that this week. I'm a former Corrections Officer and fuck if I wasn't proud of those firefighters (former inmates).  Female blocks were always a hoot, but I honestly preferred them to male blocks just for the weirdness. 
And if they are unable, should they be penalized for it?
I have a theory that homelessness causes mental illness. Lack of sleep is known to cause schizophrenia. Have you ever tried to sleep outside with all of your stuff exposed to all those crazies out there, tough to get a good night of sleep. 
In Cleveland we silently judge the homeless and act like they aren't there. it's really cool, instead of giving the homeless jobs so that they can get off the streets we just don't do that and wonder why homelessness and poverty is an issue. You should see all the nothing we do about mental health.
And not only that - they're contributing to something that benefits society and people around them instead of being mired in poverty and basically having to beg. It seems like a win-win for everybody.
Can you give us some examples?
Depends on who you are.  I don’t think so, but some of conservative friends go “*shrug*, Luck of the draw chief.”
If it doesn't cause it, it absolutely amplifies it.  Keep in mind, a lot of fortunate people with mental illness keep things relatively under control through therapy, medication, and support systems.  Homeless have none of that. They have nobody they can trust to care for them in a crisis, and I can't imagine getting the cold shoulder from every person you meet in crisis will do anything to help your opinion of the general population.
But it's not 99.99999% effective so eh we should just stop bothering with it. ^/s
"Ok I'm a bit drunk now but the biggest difference between male and female blocks is that males tend to be regimental, as in they have an established hierarchy . In a male dorm, there are shot callers, dudes who run the rest of the block. Almost like a police force. In prison these are often gang members, though in county (depending on the size of the jail) they are often just type A personalities, and more intelligent inmates. If there are problems, you can talk to the shot callers in a block and usually resolve them (assuming they problems are minor in nature, like a general complaint about A/C, or specific behavior by an inmate).   This of course depends on the relationship between the Corrections Officer (CO) and the Inmate(s). What could be resolved be the mere presence of a respected or experienced CO might turn into a shitshow with an unrrespected or experienced CO.Just like GTA2 *respect is earned* in most medium/max male blocks. You have to show you're unbiased, fair and consistent in your actions, as well as just being a general normal human being. In my personal experience people with military or ""lower class"" backrounds tend to be the best at this. (I'm biased as being an Afghan Vet before my Corrections career though)  While male inmates tend to respect masculinity and experience (an older inmate with multiple terms is respected much more than a more physically prowess 20 year old first/second timer inmate).  Female blocks on the other hand tend to be based more on social circles, and groups of friends. While in a male block the 50 year old might be a shot caller based on his experience, a 25 year old female inmate can be just as influential in a female dorm as her 50 year old male counterpart.   I'm a bit drunk right now, but I can expand later if you want. Males come down to testosterone and females come down to feelings in my experience.   Both can be a huge pain in the ass, extremely reasonable, or downright hilarious depending on the circumstances,   Both groups are thristy as fuck."
Hey -- thanks for your service.  *A toast to you for being an honest tipsy as well as comprehensively, coherently and cohesively explaining what you did.  Impressive!!*
Interesting. Just got my offer from an all-male prison today and I interview with the women's one next week. Thanks for the insight!
At first I thought you were the inmate, applying for which prison you want to be incarcerated in   Gave me a chuckle
"I had to spend 3 days for driving on a suspended.  (Unpaid ticket)  I was supposed to be out the next day but they didn't book me.for 24 hours and they don't do court every day sp.i had to wait.  Never got my phone call either...  Anyway, I am not proud to admit that I cried (not much, just the quite tear type) after I found out I wasn't leaving as soon as I thought.  Not for myself,  I can sleep on concrete np, but because my 4 month old was with my grandparents and I didn't know who was going to care for him beyond that first night and they were out of formula. I was terrified. I couldn't get a call to let anyone know what was going on and I was worried for my kids.    Those girls were awesome.  They made me feel better and encouraged me the entire time. There was some drama between the regulars but nothing outside of high school type rumors and name calling.    I felt so bad, the night before I left, a whoe cell of people (about 15 people since they were overcrowded.  They had people sleeping under the bunks) was put in the drunk tank with us for a night and a day because they tore up the toilet.  They were pretty chill.  They joked that they didn't think that far ahead in their plan.  The whole time I was there, I saw a lot of the guards be assholes to the inmates and after one dick made us wait 6 hours for tp and pads because we were banging on the doors too much (to get their attention for more tp and pads) one of the women from the evacuated cell turned to me and said ""I know it wasn't a great thing to do, but now do you understand why we do things like rip up the toilet?"" And I did.      They were ignored for hours, days if you dont count meal times, and if the guards had to a knowledge them for anything, even for basic hygiene items, they were punished in some way.  2 of my 3 nights there, a woman with a seizure disorder was in the drunk tank with me and she seized 2 or 3 dozen times before she was sent to the hospital, they kept fearing she was faking.....  For hours.  The jail nurse kept coming in with smelling salts and used them as a treatment, leaving when she stopped seizing.  The poor girl didn't even regain consciousness, they just left when she stopped thrashing.  We had to hold her head to make sure she didn't bash it on the concrete.  The reason for all the seizures?  She had been there for 5 days.  You can't get meds prescribed to you without seeing the nurse and they hadn't let her see the nurse yet (hell she was still in the drunk tank after 5 days) so she had been 5 days without her seizure meds. She almost died when she went into one while we were sleeping and cracked her head on the floor before we could restrain her.  Blood was everywhere.     Another woman was pregnant, early on, and started cramping.  It took them 7 hours to get her to the hospital and they were barley able to stop the contractions.  They said if it happened again and she didn't get something done quick, she would lose the baby.    Now I'm not saying COs are bad people, this was just a county jail in a good ole boy town.  My husband's friend he had when he was in the National Guard got a job at this jail and didn't last 2 months because of the curroption.  There were a couple of guards that were nice people, 2 guys and 3 women.    Best part?  The reason me, or any of the other women that got arrested couldn't get our phone calls was because it was a man's jail and we couldn't be out when men were on the floor.  Problem was the men were the trustees, the people that cleaned the jail and did chores.  They were always out.  The phones were in the booking area.  When I kept asking for my call, the female guards really did try but the last time I asked, the captain? Told her that the men come first.  That surprised me.  I figured any sexism that went on would be covert, but they were completely open about it.    No one ever got one.  I was lucky my husband was calling the jail every day and got me bail without me yelling him what he would have to do.  Even so, they lied to him multiple times and told him my bail was denied because he kept calling and bothering them when they gave him the run around.    Sorry, I went on a rant, but it really pissed me off.  Not because of what happened to me, but because I never would have known how bad it was here if I never forgot to pay that speeding ticket.  Or if i checked my mail to know my licence was suspended.  And most other people don't know.  I don't expect anyone to read this far but if they do, be careful.  If you are ever arrested for anything, no matter how trivial, your life is in their hands. "

Doesnt 10,872 seem low? I feel like that's how many MJ arrests NYC alone might have for a single year.
The war on drugs, what a complete waste of time.   Thank you to the kind mysterious benefactor for giving me silver.
The U.S and recreational marijuana are like two high school wall flowers at a dance.  Both are staring at each other and someone just needs to do something at this point.  Edit: Thanks for the Silver friend!
Good, quit clogging the prison corporations with bullshit charges.
All nonviolent marijuana convictions should be pardoned.  This is just common sense.
The article goes on to state that the rest of the state will have 13,357 marijuana convictions expunged.
people are getting rich as fuck off of it. not a waste of time to them.
Depends on what the goal was. The stated goal was to get people to not use drugs. It failed at that. The real reason behind the war on drugs was to target minorities and cause generational harm to them. Moreover, while they're in jail, they do work for pennies and corporations get to benefit off of that (private AND public prisons have done this for decades).  Slavery is legal if you're in jail. Also, felons can't own guns. It accomplishes a ton of racist goals.
10,872 New Yorkers to See Their Marijuana Convictions Disappear  By Azi PaybarahAug. 28, 2019  Even as states across the country have legalized marijuana, potentially opening the door to a multibillion dollar industry, the impact of marijuana criminalization is still being felt by people — mostly black and Hispanic — whose records are marked by low-level convictions related to the drug.  But on Wednesday, New York began the process of expunging many of those records, as part of a new state law to reduce penalties associated with marijuana-related crimes, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo confirmed.  “For too long communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by laws governing marijuana and have suffered the lifelong consequences of an unfair marijuana conviction,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.  Under the new law, which was passed in June and took effect on Wednesday, 10,872 people in New York City will automatically have their records wiped clean of marijuana convictions, according to a spokeswoman for the State Division of Criminal Justice Services. In the rest of the state, an additional 13,357 people will see marijuana convictions cleared from their records, the spokeswoman said.  Sealing these records would ensure that a person’s marijuana-related conviction would not come up in most background checks, state officials said.  A method for expunging the records, which has never been done in New York, is still being developed, the officials said. The process could take up to a year, a spokesman for the State Office of Court Administration, Lucian Chalfen, said.  The Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit group, said the number of people who would have their records cleared could be many times higher than the number cited by the state; the alliance cited figures showing that between 1990 and 2018, 867,701 arrests were made in New York State for low-level marijuana offenses.  Under the new law, the classification of the penalty for possessing between one and two ounces of marijuana has been lowered to a violation, and fines have been capped at $200. Previously, such possession was a Class B misdemeanor. The fine for possessing less than one ounce of marijuana has been lowered to $50, from $150.  The move to reduce fines and clear people’s records has been embraced by advocates of criminal justice reform, many of whom said criminal penalties for using marijuana fell disproportionately on black and Hispanic residents.  Khalil A. Cumberbatch, an advocate who was pardoned by Mr. Cuomo in 2014 after serving time for a robbery conviction, said in a statement that expunging marijuana records “gives people a new lease on life, removing the suffocating stain of stigma that prevents so many from reaching their highest potential.”  State Senator Zellnor Myrie of Brooklyn, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he hoped lawmakers will build on this “first step.”  “I represent Brownsville; that was ground zero for a lot of this,” he said of marijuana enforcement. Expunging records “is just the beginning of the state recognizing the errors of that war.”  In February, a study from John Jay College found that “blacks and Hispanics consistently had higher rates of arrest for misdemeanor marijuana possession compared to whites.”  Kevin Sabet, director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an advocacy group, said he embraced expunging low-level offenses, but not full legalization.  “We don’t want people in prison for marijuana use,” Mr. Sabet said. “But the criminal sanctions on marijuana is not a reason to commercialize and normalize marijuana.”  Mr. Sabet said he wanted to see marijuana possession likened to driving over the speed limit. “It’s something discouraged,” he said, “but it’s not something that is going to destroy your life if you’re caught doing it.”  New York began decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana in 1977, one of the few states to take such a step at that time. In 2014, the state legalized a medicinal marijuana program with restrictions that reflected Mr. Cuomo’s apprehension toward the drug; for example, smoking and eating the drug are prohibited under that program.  Today, more than 30 states allow medical use of marijuana. Eleven states have legalized the adult use of marijuana. Last year, the district attorneys in Manhattan and Brooklyn stopped prosecuting cases of marijuana possession and smoking in public.
conservative school principal *glares menacingly*
Fill them with all the sexual crimes and corporate businessmen that keep getting slaps on the wrist
Sanders is proposing the same thing mate
Still absurdly low. And the article also states it could be much more than that.  > The Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit group, **said the number of people who would have their records cleared could be many times higher than the number cited by the state**; the alliance cited figures showing that between 1990 and 2018, **867,701** arrests were made in New York State for low-level marijuana offenses.
I would like 1 rich please.
That's a great step, but wouldn't it be better to just, you know, make it legal? they don't prosecute it anymore, so how about making it legal so we can stop having to buy pot in sketchy situations, and having it regulated means no one has to worry about it being laced with anything... Seems like a no brainer.
A lot of people could have done deferred prosecutions and have expunged their arrest records. Thus, not needing this legislation to clear their records.
While this is a legitimate approach and would be ideal, the manpower/cost it would take to *automatically* do this would likely be very high.  A more realistic and cost effective approach would be for the Justice Department to create an expedited appeal process for people to enroll in on their own.  Edit: context is key. I am 100% in favor of expunging all marijuana related charges on any and all person(s) records. I said what I said in response to people with combined charges. I want it to happen, I’m just saying there is a challenge in doing so.
Who wouldnt want to be a poacher poacher?
I saw a story like this a while back, except it was Rhinos they were protecting. It was super cool the Rhino knew what was up and wasn't afraid to be near them. They also looked much more intimidating. I'll see if I can find the link
what if they hired all the poachers for the brigade, now with stable jobs they don't have to poach anymore.
But what about the married elephants!?
This is the kind of thing I'd make a donation to.  No tote bags, just results.
I can't imagine how nice of a change that assignment must be. Going from fighting terrorists or guarding borders to protecting gentle giants. That job would make me love everything about life.
The most dangerous game. 
I'd watch that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson movie.   **This summer....** *shot of him looking at tattered photo of baby elephant that he adopted and lost to poachers*   **It's personal....** *Montage of building arsenal of grenade launchers and flame throwers*     **Dwayne Johnson is....**  Diner waitress: how do you want your eggs, hun?   *looks at camera* Double poached.    **Poacher Poacher: Karma's a bitch** 
It's just unfortunate that these poachers are often poor and desperate locals trying to feed their families. They know the work is dangerous a lot of the time, but it's hard to argue with the payout, especially if you see someone who has also done it and all the wealth it brings.
http://rhino-force.org  Not the original post I saw but here is one like it. They seem to have more funding  
I recall reading about a tiger conservation organization doing something like this. They hired tiger poachers to help deter poaching instead. The men were given steady jobs so they wouldn’t turn to poaching, and it ended up being a huge help for the organizations hiring them. The ex-poachers knew where popular trapping sites were, and also knew how to find and track tigers. 
Survival of you and your family. Watch your children starve to death or shoot an animal to sell its tusks? It really is a straightforward decision. 
Check out [the International Anti-Poaching Foundation](https://www.iapf.org). It was founded by a guy named Damien Mander, who was an Australian Royal Navy clearance diver and special ops sniper.   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Anti-Poaching_Foundation) and [GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/32-0408734)
This is why I stopped giving to the ASPCA and started giving local! The ASPCA sent me blankets and jackets and tote bags and beach towels. OMG, if you have enough money to fill my bathroom closet, you don’t need my money! 
They drew first blood.
Poachers are always depicted as unethical monsters, hasn’t really crossed my mind that they could be poor and without options. 
Was this the outfit with the attractive tattooed female sniper? 
 Why were the tigers being killed?
"Neat!   Also, does that dude have ""SEEK & DESTROY"" tattooed on his chest?"
You keep describing your life like Rambo
Same could be said about drug dealers trying to feed their family or even robbers. The ends don't justify the means
No that was Vin Diesel's last XXX movie.
Yeah, several african countries partially fund their anti-poaching taskforces. By selling rights to shoot troublemaking animals.   So once in a while you have a rampaging elephant or rhino which keeps going onto farms or attacking houses. So they basically auction off the right to shoot it instead of hunting it down themselves. And use the proceeds to save many more animals.

Well I've found that existential dread is best dealt with via ham-handed pop culture references and self-deprecating memes, don't you agree?

"After the mother rhino and calf were heard being killed.  >In the backseat of one of the speeding Land Cruisers, Benzene, a Zimbabwean ranger who had spent nearly a year watching over Basta and her calf and knew the pair intimately, loaded three shells into his shotgun, flicked on the safety, and chambered a round. As we bounced into the night, he said, ""It is better for the poachers if they meet a lion than if they meet us."""
what is a man but a miserable pile of memes?
Sounds like a total badass, but it's funny his name is Benzene. I'm sure it's not pronounced like the chemical though.
I already help fund a drone war against poachers.   http://airshepherd.org/
I wonder how much they're allowed to make in total. They have a similar program here in Tucson, AZ, where the homeless can only earn up to $100 a week and I think $1000 a year.
>Arkansas has been paying homeless people $9.25 an hour — two bucks more than the federal minimum wage — to pick up trash around its state capital.  This is because $9.25 *is the minimum wage* in Arkansas.
Do I have to be homeless to apply?
i've always said utilizing the homeless for green projects was a genius move people weren't doing.
Honestly this is wonderful news. However, as someone who has worked extensively with people with psychiatric, mood disorders, and TBI patients, a large portion of the homeless population have some form mental health problem.  I know it's easy to characterise homelessness and a lack of job as laziness, but in many cases it is not.  The problem with this program is that it does not account for mental health disorders. Those individuals will not be able to participate in these programs.  Currently, there is this perception that homeless people can get out of their situation simply if they tried harder. If they get their shit together, get a job and stopped being lazy, they can afford housing. However, in many instances  of homelessness, there is a medical/psychiatric/psychological condition that needs to be treated. In these cases, homelessness is a consequence of their condition, not a character flaw.   Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful program and will help many people. However, don't be surprised if  you still homeless people around.
"I can see the logic, but it seems like this could be a real opportunity and they are missing out. I'd love to see a program where, if you collect trash for 20 hours a week every week for a month, you get transitional housing and an increase to 30 hours a week. Another month and you get full time (salaried, 25-40k depending on region) and health benefits and a financial counselor to help plan for the future. After 6 months, you would be expected to move out of the transitional housing and into an apartment of your own. Do that, and you will probably have some really dedicated employees and a cleaner city. And once they've had enough of a work history beautifying the city, they can move on to more personally meaningful work, freeing up a position for another homeless person.  Edit: Woo, go to a meeting, come back to 100 replies. In reply to the common refrain ""that's more than I make!"" Yeah, your salary is fucking bullshit and we need to address that too. Workers need to unite in this country and take back the profits we've been making for our corporate masters. $12.50 (the lowest amount I've suggested) is *barely* a living wage in most parts of the country. If you make less than that, you probably work two jobs or have multiple roommates. That's fucking bullshit and not something we should just roll over and accept and bitch when someone gets a better opportunity. We can't create programs that pay people shit just because other people are paid shit. We need to increase the minimum wage to an actual living wage.  In reply to the comments about how would we pay for this? Taxes, man. We pay for it by taxing the absurdly wealthy and the corporations that run our country. We have [some of the lowest tax rates](https://bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Free_Resources/Federal-Income-Tax-Rates.aspx) in our national history right now. Just a bit higher than the Great Depression. Trickle down economics is a lie. We need to tax more.  I should also clarify the housing component. Transitional housing doesn't mean *free* housing. They would still have to pay for it. They just couldn't be turned away for lack of rental history, lack of income, etc. The rent would still need to come out of their paycheck, and they would still need to go through the process of paying it (i.e. not automatically deduced from pay).  Edit 2: Thank you for the gold and silver! While I greatly appreciate the awards, I ask anyone else who wishes to award this comment to please consider donating to your local food bank, homeless shelter, or soup kitchen instead."
Its capped for a reason...  The [cobra effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect) occurs when an attempted solution to a problem makes the problem worse, as a type of unintended consequence. The term is used to illustrate the causes of incorrect stimulation in economy and politics.  The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially this was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward.   Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free.   As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse.
A very good thing. Homeless that are motivated to work are motivated to not be homeless. I personally know a few people that would rather beg for money, do meth, and sleep in an alley.
How the fuck is minimum wage in Arkansas higher than PA? I want to punch everyone in our Commonwealth now.  (Note: the answer for why is that the legislature hates Pittsburgh and Philly and has basically said they'll cut off their noses to spite the libs)
Haha around here those figures equate to 600 % the minimum wage. I can picture myself collecting trash for that kind of money...
"SoUnDs LiKe SoCiAlIsM!!!  But seriously. This is a great idea! I just hate that a few politicians or pissed off ""economically distressed"" people would kill programs like this in most places before they even give them a chance to see if they work.  Edit: Guys, “SoUnDs LiKe SoCiAlIsM!!!” is sarcastic. I’m mocking the conservative way of thinking about this kind of stuff. It’s their default line of attack. I’m not saying that’s what it is. Sorry for the confusion!"
I would quit my full-time job for that.
Most homeless want to better themselves but suffer from severe mental illness, so they struggle with bring able to work on a regular schedule. Hopefully they offer additonal services for the homeless and extremely flexible hours (show up when you can) and get paid for the work you do.
In 2018, Arkansas voters passed a referendum raising the state minimum wage to $11 an hour - it's being raised in stages and is currently at $9.25. They did this while also voting by large margins for Republican candidates who all opposed raising the minimum wage.  What can I say, people are weird like that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
NIMBY, dude. A lot of people simply don't care; they may not wish harm upon the homeless, but they don't want to see it, let alone deal with it. There was a story from a while back where a homeless charity or something had bought some land near an upscale neighborhood in San Francisco to build a shelter or transitional housing, and the citizens of that community raised funds...to hire a high-profile lawyer to fight it.
It's 12.50 an hour at the low end, so still below what I feel is a reasonable minimum wage, but you're right - there are a TON of folks with mortgages and difficult jobs that make less than that. We really do need to advocate for ~~worker's~~ human rights in this nation.
United Provinces of River Plate, also known as Argentina.
It really just takes a few people to make it unpleasant. Drive by these places like homeless shelters, methadone clinics, and halfway houses and there is almost always a few people causing trouble. You have assault s, aggressive panhandling, and maybe someone gets stabbed once in awhile. It's not a made up concern. If shelters were historically good neighbors and took more responsibility it wouldn't be as big of a problem. Police aren't going to show up every time to babysit these antisocial behaviors so the result is nobody wants them around.   I know of non-profits building mixed use housing for these type of people. They hang around outside glaring at people and it has hurt surrounding businesses.
"Can we start a petition to change the definition of a raccoon to ""A cat wearing a mask that climbs trees and shit."""
Raccoon?
This is by far the best post I've come across. 
Somewhat relevant.  Once my daughter kept asking me if she could have a raccoon and I kept telling her it was a wild animal so she couldn’t have one, and she was getting so frustrated with me. She was about 3 years old at the time. She kept trying to explain that she didn’t want a *raccoon*, she wanted a *RACCOON*. Finally she said she wanted a *chocolate* raccoon and I asked if she wanted a chocolate shaped like a raccoon? No. She was so exasperated. “A *raccoon*, mom! A little chocolate *raccoon* like you gave me yesterday!”   Yeah, she wanted a *macaroon*..

You might have to sign in with your cable provider to watch it though, I'm not sure.  Edit: I think the exact start time may change depending on when they put the ads in the video.  Edit again: I found a free link [here](https://www.wcostream.com/shorties-watchin-shorties-episode-12) that's not behind a paywall. It starts around 8:19 in this link. You'll probably want to make sure you have adblock though. Not sure why it's listed as episode 12 here, but 9 on cc.com.
This is almost certainly from Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist, which was a cartoon on Comedy Central featuring comedians doing their acts in a therapist's office. All the episodes are on YouTube so if it's worth it, spend a day going thru them.  I'm 99% sure I've even seen this episode.

You can however stare at the episode thumbnails on Amazon Prime, but the episodes ""are not available"" on Prime. You can buy it on DVD on Amazon for well over $100.  You can always try the pirate life, I'll ask my roommate about it when he gets home.  The studio that animated this show might just be the same studio that animated the Ricky Gervais Show."
Man this sounds familiar. Almost like a sketch from k&p or sunny. I'm going to smoke a joint and look for it. I think CC is the right direction.

Now I only want to call it this.
Oooooooh shit that's what it's called, thanks.   Solved!
Please tell me you don't actually call it pasta cake?
I don't. I am of Italian heritage, and call it lasagna. It's just hard remembering the name of a food you just had a nightmare of at 1 in the morning drenched in sweat and pushing out a turd. 
/r/evenwithcontext
Are you like... ok?
I'm honestly not sure. At the time I posted that I couldn't fall asleep and was just uncomfortably sweaty.
No, the nightmare I had was about being baked into a giant lasagna, and then I woke up muttering pasta cake. I sprung out of bed drenched in sweat and sprinted to my bathroom and let out a fiery shit from the ultra hot burrito I ate last night. While I was releasing the pyroclastic flow, I struggled to think what a pasta cake was.

Baader meinhof phenomenon
WHAT THE FUCK I literally explained this to my girlfriend 30 minutes ago now it appears here
Since I learned of the baader meinhof phenomenon, I’ve been seeing people discussing baader meinhof more than I ever have before; I’m experiencing baader meinhof with baader meinhof
Thankyou for knowing this!! I was on about this the other day and couldn’t remember the name, now it’s popped up on here. How ironic 
Danke schön
The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon is also affected by the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, I think they even mention it on the Wikipedia 
Don't worry, you'll see it again tomorrow...
"*Okay so we tried patchouli in 4 different forms, camphor, creosote and a couple versions of sage. None of them worked out. But I went to my old childhood neighborhood and unbeknownst to me, the neighbor had a damn Arizona native eucalyptus! I took one of the branches off of the tree and took some bark. Nothing on the tree smelled like it right now, but the air around me smelled vaguely of that smell I was searching for. So it might actually be a version of eucalyptus being baked in the sun. I will continue to try other suggestions and keep you all posted.*  So it smells like if you were to take a eucalyptus leaf, throw it in the dirt, and then stick it in a book for a couple years. I know, it's crazy. But that's the exact smell I'm smelling yet it's common enough to trigger my frustrations every couple months. It smells like eucalyptus leaves without the menthol, and it smells like dirt without the intricate smells dirt has, if that makes sense. It's a flat dirt smell, like if you got a face full of it but didn't spend time thinking about the subtle hints. Then of course, it smells like dust. Those are the things that make it earthy on top of it being eucalyptus-esque. I'm so sorry I wrapped you guys into this, but I will commit a lot of time to this with you guys until we solve it, and I guarantee the money to the person who guessed it first. Please don't just spout out all the scents you can think of. I'll make it a little strict. Limit a single comment to 3 smells maximum if they're individual of each other, and if you have more ideas add them in replies to your comment, that way I'm not just looking at a million smells I could have gotten a list of myself by just googling ""list of smells""  Ok time for an Edit: I think it's safe to say that I won't be able to comment on everyone else's comments, to my chagrin. I commented on about 200 of your comments and I'm just overwhelmed like climbing a mountain only to find that it's grown since you started. I will absolutely 100% go through every single comment, however, so PLEASE don't feel bad if I don't reply, your input has meant the world to me. My girlfriend knows how frustrated I am over this every time I smell it and in trader Joe's a week ago I forced her to stop to try to smell it. The leading case is creosote, however, this smell I smell occasionally is absolutely not the characteristic southwestern smell before it rains. I know that smell distinctly, a sweet, earthy smell that smells like a mix of asphalt and victory. This smell I'm thinking of smells EXACTLY as I've described it. The worst part is I can't describe it in a way that makes a lot of sense, as I assume it would require me putting multiple smells together in order to try to compare it. Again, you guys are awesome and I've yet to come across a single disparaging or mean comment and that makes this all worth it. I will award whoever guessed first with the prize money and I will have multiple people verify that said person was indeed the first comment to mention it, if it comes down to multiple people having guessed it. It might take a few weeks and if it's one of the obscure comments it could take up to a couple of months depending on how much free time and extra money I have in the coming weeks, but I will no doubt get through every one of these comments and try any that are remotely viable, then, if we all succeed in discovering the source of the scent, I will make another post congratulating the winner. **If we do not solve this mystery this time I will repost when I have more free time and up the anty**  Thank you all again so much."

"Original has been deleted.   A Christopher Nolan film. On the surface it looks like a period piece set in the 60's -70's. A man in prison (Joesph Gordon Levitt) struggling with depression. In his cell, contemplating suicide, he begins recounting his troubled childhood to his cellmate, Micheal Cane.  In the first act we go quickly through his younger life. A child on a farm with 4 siblings, a strict father and a distant mother. The family moves to the city, where he gets bullied for being a hick. He finds solace reading old military books. Using tactics from his book, he and a group of misfit friends defeat the bullies.  Cut to prison where he is still considering suicide, staring at a homemade noose. Michael Cane urges him to continue.  He then relates dropping out of school, and traveling with some hippies led by Ellen Page, whom he is in love with. She flirts but keeps him at a distance. He has a knack for painting. This act focuses on his pursuit of Page, trying to get close to her through his art.It all comes crashing down when it is revealed she is a lesbian, which he discovers when he walks in on her with another woman. Dejected, and angry with himself he leaves the group.  He tries to get into a prestigious art college to avoid the draft but is rejected. He bites the bullet and enlist. Standard military ""War is Hell"" montage interspersed with him in prison crying. Cane is not consoling, but tells him some wise Michael Cane words about life being a struggle and it is our choice to live or die.  He gets out and on a chance encounter meets back up with Page. She is now part of a political activist group. Having nowhere to go he joins them. With his strict fathers upbringing, love of history, charisma and military service he becomes the face of the group. They plan to hold a huge rally. At the rally he gets arrested. At trial, Page back stabs him in a plea deal to get her charges dropped, and he gets 5 years.  Back to Cane and Levitt. We find out hes been in jail almost a year. Cane, who we thought all along was talking him down, is actually urging him to hang himself. A back and forth of dialog ensues, culminating in Cane attacking Levitt and putting the nose around his neck. Levitt, now wanting to live,fights him off. Just then the guards appear to break up the fight. They also announce he is getting early release.  Cut to Levitt being released from prison. Making his way down a long hallway. He passes by Cane's cell, where he has a defeated look on his face. The camra lingers on the cell and Cane says to someone offscreen. ""I've failed. I tried to stop you but I've failed. Father help us all."" Camera pans to reveal Ellen Page, in the shadows smirking in the corner of the jail cell.  As Levitt exits the prison a sepia tone takes over the screen. We see we are not in 1970's America, but 1920's Berlin. As Levitt walks down the street a free man, we see brief shots from his past, redone in a style appropriate for the 20's. All scenes with Ellen Pages have her replaced with Cillian Murphy. He enters a beer hall and is greeted by cheers from his former protesters, now wearing swastika armbands. You realize you just spent 2 and a half hours rooting for Hitler.  "
"Similar to the opening scene of Doctor Who episode ""The Magician's Apprentice,"" where you see a frightened little boy in the middle of a mine field in the middle of an active war zone, and the Doctor tries to help him, and then when he asks the boy's name, it's Davros, one of the Doctor's longest and worst foes.

He went into a freezing pond to teach us this lesson. What a guy
First video I have seen where the self rescuer did it in a full set of clothing and boots.  Made it that much more informative/personally relatable for me, as I also frequently wear boots.  
This is worth signing in and upvoting. I predict in 3 years someone will post a story about how they fell through thin ice, remembered this gif and saved their life. 
Pro tip - Not walking on frozen ponds or lakes decreases the odds of falling through ice by a large percentage
Only to be hit by a bus at the end. 
He's so chill about it. Isn't he fucking **FREEZING**
He forgets an important part - get up the way you came. You know the ice was strong enough to carry you that way.
This feels like learning about quicksand as a kid. You expect it to happen one day even though it probably won't, but it's good to know regardless.
Saw a video like this, not this one in particular, and it saved my life and my dog's life, well, she would have lived either way.  My dog chased a duck out onto the middle of a frozen pond.  The ice was thin though.  She weighs about sixty pounds.  She fell through about fifty feet from the shore and was treading water.  We were in the middle of the woods, so by the time any help would have arrived (had I called), she would have been a dogsicle.  I figured I could belly crawl out to her and pull her up onto the ice.  Since I'd be getting a little wet from the ice, I decided to leave my jacket and phone on the shore, so I'd have a warm dry jacket.  I made it to the dog but when I grabbed her collar, she pulled me in.  I could touch muddy bottom without going under, but barely.  I threw the dog onto the ice and was left alone with my thoughts for a bit. I tried pulling myself up, but that didn't work at all.  Then I thought about somebody finding my frozen corpse in the pond and how lame that would be.  I also thought about how I didn't call for help and how I left my phone 50 feet away.  Then I remembered the video.  Shit worked, I basically swam onto the ice and crawled back to shore.  One of the many times I've stupidly almost died.   
He misses the first step in the tutorial: don't walk on thin ice.

Can confirm, you have to stay calm. Thrashing just breaks more ice and creates a bigger hole and a bigger mess for you to get out of. I grew up 2 blocks from a river, fallen through the ice many times being a stupid kid. The shower after your miserable walk home will feel like pure fire covering your body.

Piggybacking the top comment to add a little info as well. Another technique to get yourself onto stronger ice is to roll as well once your back on the ledge. So kick yourself up and forward, and then turn 90 degrees while lying down, and roll towards the strong ice. Crawling works as well, but you won’t be putting your weight on four areas (knees and hands or elbows) if you roll.   Source: Have done ice rescue for Coast Guard.   Edit: Just realized this isn’t the top comment but whatever, imma leave it. 
I too was thinking somebody should give the guy actual gold for sacrificing his own comfort and risking his health simply to improve the odds of his anonymous viewers actually learning a life saving technique.   I say bravo and thank you.  e:sp
Important note: after breaking through into ice-cold water, you immediately become a candidate for hypothermia treatment.  * Get inside.  * Remove wet clothing and get yourself dried off with towels.  * Put on dry clothing and wrap in blankets, focusing on warming your torso.  **Do not immerse in warm water**, which can warm too fast.  * Drink a warm beverage without caffeine and without alcohol.  * Wrap head and neck in blanket to warm them as well. 
I'm a fellow boot-wearer
I wish I saw this video before I fell through the ice.  I'll never forget it.  My brother and I were playing hockey on our backyard pond.  All of the sudden I lost my balance, fell, and the ice broke around me.  I was incredibly calm under the water, thinking my brother was going to simply pull me out.  I get to the surface and realize he's right next to me. THATS WHEN THE COLD SHOCK HIT.  We both panic and desperately try to get out, the ice continually breaking around us, and were both becoming increasingly terrified we wont get out of this.  Somehow we both manage to calm ourselves down enough to slowly work our way out of the water and crawl off the pond.  After we got inside we looked out at the pond and realized that if we turned around 180 degrees after falling in, we couldve easily walked out, with no struggle. 
Happened with Les Stroud's Survivorman.  He did an episode about how to survive after a snowmobile accident, detailing all the parts you can rip off a snowmobile for survival and the things you can make with them without any tools.

Yes that’s what’s making him chill. 
In the source video this is included after he hops back in to give viewers a second angle. 
"> Now that I've gotten older, not only have I never stepped in quicksand- I've never even heard about it! No one's ever been like, ""Hey if you're coming to visit, take I-90 'cause I-95 has a little quicksand in the middle. Looks like regular sand, but then you're gonna start to sink into it."""
haha yes! You'd be surprised how many people end up in water.   The first life I saved was a disabled man drowning in the river, still unsure on how he ended up in the river in the first place.  If information can save your life then it's good to learn as much as possible 
I'm glad the doggo was okay. And you I guess.

If you're within a reasonable distance (2-3 mins) of your house (or any source of dry clothes) it's worth doing 1 & 2 backwards. Fully wet clothing drains heat out of your skin at an unbelievable rate, whereas being naked will feel absolutely brutally uncomfortable, but bleeds considerably less heat - and allows you to move at full speed.   If you're less than a minute or more than a few minutes away from being indoors, don't take this advice though.   If you're more than 5 minutes from dry clothes, but you're in a snowy area, immediately take off your outer-layer and roll in the snow. It's a really good insulator. 
There are literally dozens of us.
That last part 😂   I guess even when your frozen it’s hard to keep a...   Cool head 
> I only wear sandles with socks. So I'm guessing this technique won't work for me.   Its probably not worth trying to save yourself in that case anyway.

Running is for mortals. I *glide* over the ice. 
Wow, he's so cool.
Jesus would not have fallen into the water though.
And if you are far from any sort of shelter, it is advisable that you disrobe and roll around in the snow for a bit.  >The reason behind rolling in the snow naked after you fall into icy water is to soak up the water off of you. This will only work with really dry snow and only if your skin isnt warm enough to quickly melt more snow. You will lose heat quicker in wet clothes or if your skin is wet.

He'd have turned it into wine and drowned his sorrows in it.
But then aren't you putting wet clothes back on immediately afterward? Squeeze them as dry as possible I suppose. 
When I was a kid I was out at sea in a small boat with my step grandfather in the early winter, just before the sea was expected to freeze. He was a navy man from his late teens until his retirement, so he knows a thing or two about the sea.   Anyway, he told me that if one falls into freezing water the first thing one should do is to get out of the water, the second thing is to remove all wet clothes, because that will increase the time to survive before freezing to death and thereby increase ones chances of rescue. As I looked around I saw nothing but small, rocky islands that would offer no protection against the elements and I thought about how I would have to swim to one of those islands and take off all clothes and hope to be rescued in time if the boat would sink.   I guess I hadn't realized just how dangerous the sea could be until that point, but the way he told me it was all about increasing the chances of being rescued really made it clear that cold water is nothing to screw around with. 
Anyway, how's your sex life?

My dad is a really huge Walt Disney fan. He owns over 100 books about Walt, the imagineers, and animation like this. He's read all of them. I'm going to send him this link in case he hasn't seen it already. Just wanted to say thanks for posting this. There aren't a ton of things we can relate to, but if I can show him something about old Disney that he hasn't seen before - then that will make his day and mine.   **Edit:** I've found out the multiplane camera is at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. He went there for the first time last year. So I now know for sure he's at least SEEN the machine, I still don't know if he's seen it in action. But here's a [bonus pic](https://i.imgur.com/UtkVOoF.jpg) of my dad cheesing super hard outside the museum last year.
Beautiful.

The sheer amount of fakery Hollywood creates is astounding. It's amazing how much your eye can be fooled by the simplest of tricks. 
Even still, the lengths at which these animators go through is impressive. If this was only an opening scene, imagine how tedious it would be to get a full movie finished this way.
Wait.. how high are you?
I really love this video. I also think Walt Disney was a fantastic narrator, his knowledge and passion really shows in his narration
Amazing.
I am an idiot...
It's incredible what they were able to come up with at the time. A lot of animations still use this kind of layering technique. The effect can be made in after effects and isn't terribly hard to accomplish. It can make any ordinary photo have great depth!  [Here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t6H6pTeupeE) is an example of the process if anyone is interested.

The ideal space is 25x the length of my car.  Don't tell me the ideal space is only 1.5x the length of my car.
now do one where the space is an inch longer than your car. 
Where is the step where I circle the block until two spots are available for my signature granny park.
1.5x length of your car hahahaha   [*laughs in Brooklyn*](https://i.imgur.com/Uay73tg.png)

"Wanna be able to do this well?     Grab an empty wine bottle, put it on a table, and practice ""shooting"" into the neck of the bottle without touching the sides. "
I would have loved to see left and right English demonstrated here.  Forward and back seem pretty simple to me, whereas left and right English seem to have more effect on the trajectory of the target ball.  
Stun shots are actually easier than they look. It's possible to do not-too-shitty stun shot with like an hour or so of practice. The farther you get from the center, the more error prone the shot gets and you start to depend more on your fundamentals being correct, so the follow, draw and sidespin shots take more practice to get to a level where the cue ball behaves kinda sorta a little bit how you planned it to.
That's because they are playing on well kept tables with good sticks. Most people play at bars where people treat the sticks poorly and put their drinks/ash cigs on the table. Pool isn't that hard if you understand the basics of english and you play on good tables.
Yes! I expected it to go over left and right too.
I mean, the YT link is literally in there.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rask8MYJaB4  Edit: ..which also doesn't include the other angles. That's a bummer.
A proper and consistent stroke is the key to being able to do all of this.
They didn't show it, but you can use left and right English to make the cue ball 'grab' the rail so it doesn't deviate from that straight path. Pool is amazing, and so are the people that master it!
What sort of size wine bottles are you drinking out of if you can shoot a pool ball into it?!
Okay now what do I do about all the glass shards? Just play it through?
"Left English : *""Workers should seize the means of productions""*   Right English : *""I wish thing were like before, when white men ran everything""*"
English and top spin are way harder than draw shots for me, something about it I cant wrap my head around. 
I understand basic english but pool is still difficult as fudge.
At least they did the ones I was most interested in seeing. 
Ok I have my pants off, what now? 
Man I'm gonna wreck people at pool now that I can put on a narly posh accent
I think he means threading the stick through the opening
Ohhhh! I see now. Thanks, cunt wrecker.
I was like damn that’s a little uncalled for but then I saw 
Yeah that’s not backstroke, animator
I assume he's trying to submerge himself by doing backstroke **backwards**?
Literally lol'd when my man started backstroking imagining my friends having one last laugh at me while they are dying & i am saved.
I'll be sure to add this to my folder of childhood fears that never came to fruition. I was fully expecting my adulthood to be surround by hidden quicksand everywhere.
I was thinking if wanna see that tried by a real person, not a cartoon, so I found Bear Grylls doing it. And as a bonus, at the end he takes off his clothes (if Bear Grylls is your cup of tea). https://youtu.be/yg88Tw8oAbk
Step 1: Bend backwards 90 degrees   Step 2: Break your arms  Step 3: ???
"""As a kid I always thought that quicksand was going to be a much bigger problem than it turned out to be. Because if you watch cartoons, quicksand is like the third biggest thing you have to worry about in adult life behind real sticks of dynamite and giant anvils falling on you from the sky. I used to sit around and think about what to do about quicksand. I never thought about how to handle real problems in adult life, I was never like oh what's it gonna be like when relatives ask to borrow money?"""
"If somebody can drown in 1"" of water I’m sure they could figure out how to drown in quicksand."
I was so confused, had to watch it twice.  Then I actually lay on the ground and tried to backstroke to see if I was going crazy
That and ripping his top half off
Backwardstroke
>& i am saved.  Executing this technique without panicking will be an immense difficulty for most people. Don't assume that you're safe!
And being on fire. Stop. Drop. Roll. Thought I’d be using that one too.
Isn't it different than what they said in the gif? Also TIL Bear Grylls half naked doesn't do anything for me 🤷🏻‍♀️
His sideroll upwards was also fantastic
I kinda hoped it would turn out super sarcastic after that bit.  Like the whole rest of the video would be stupid or downright wrong advice.  But I knew the sub so I figured it would be legit...or legit-ish.  Not sure if disappointed.
I've seen so many videos of people on fire who do not stop drop and roll. I'd say that one is a million times more valuable than this quicksand information
Yeah I was disappointed that Bears friend didnt sever him at the hips then throw his torso back into his legs
Ye, Grylls does it differently but it's kinda the same principle.
50% of his body instantly reattaching to his lower part was pretty impressive.
r/nobodyasked
I like how it immediately starts by contradicting the gif calling it lethal, as well as saying it's known for swallowing people whole, then bear says they don't actually swallow you whole, but the sun kills you from being trapped  Which fucking one is it guys, will I float indefinitely or swallowed whole
This may seem like a really stupid question, but are igloos still being constructed today? And if so Have there been any modern advances in igloo construction? 
So about how long would that take to make?
Does anybody know how they construct the snow/ice slabs?   Also, would it be cold enough to have a fire inside the igloo or would it just melt?   Edit: thank you everybody for the feedback, it was all very informative and I have learnt a lot. My favourite was the poop-knife! Thanks 👍🏼
how long do they typically last for? 
I wonder why they never made bigger and more permanent dwellings. Doesn't seem like they are hurting for construction material. 
Im pretty sure this video was shown to me when i was in boy scouts around 1996. We tried to build one of our own but the snow wasnt hard enough.
Damn that’s cool
But where do you get massive brick pieces of snow?
You know what’s really fuckin my mind inside out right now? These natives of the arctic, the Sentinel Islanders, nomadic Bedouins, you, me...   All the same species.  Is there anything else on earth as remotely adaptable as a human?
Some of the native inuit people in northern canada still do. It's a skill they do their best to teach their youngs as it is very useful to know how to make a shelter if you're caught in a storm or lost. 
Based on my knowledge, igloos are only used occasionally. Modern igloos are not made of snow and ice but glass or other materials. They can be found in Scandinavia as hotels/campsites.
Inuit from Nunavut (Arctic Canada) checking in. Yes, we still make them and use them while hunting in the winter but we live in normal houses the rest of the time. As for modern advances, not much has changed, except we use metal snow knives instead of the carved ivory ones they used in the old pre-colonization days.
They are used by military survival instructors, and they teach their students how to make them incase an aircrew goes down in such an enviroment. Obviously, not permanent, just to survive the elements until rescue.   Source: SERE graduate  Edit: i should add, this was something they taught us the prinicples of, but as students we didnt actually build one.  The instructors however do, when they attend their winter survival course to become an instructor. 
[Stuff you should know](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-igloos-work.htm) Did a podcast on them and said the Inuit could complete an igloo in a little over an hour. 
Did you even watch the clip? It took about 35seconds...
"Did survival training in Alaska for the Air Force, these things are a bitch when you don't have the right tools.  You can realistically build it in about 1.5 hours with two people, but a lot of the time comes down to snow selection, cutting precision and ""chinking"".  To find the right snow for these snow blocks you essentially are looking for the side of a slope that is pounded with wind. This compacts the snow. You need to be careful because sometimes there's a crust about 6 inches and then everything underneath is powder. For insulation you need minimum 8 inches, preferably more.   It can take a hot minute to find the right snow, let alone harvesting it.   Then you need to cut this shit perfectly. If it's not perfect you're going to spend hours ""chinking"" which is taking small misshapened snow blocks and filling the gaps, then covering the whole inside  and outside with spare snow until there are no pinholes. You need complete coverage so your body heat can warm the space and not let it escape.   You also should not just build a door straight in. Instead you could dig down and out like a tunnel to create a cold sump, so all the cold air can sink into one spot.  Total time, with instruction, spades, and 6 snow saws between 8 people: 4 hours.  "
The blocks of snow are harvested right where they are building the igloo.  Not like a snowstorm in more temperate climes, the snow is there all the time in some spots. It gets weighed down with more snow and comoresses, making it suitable for the job.  All that aside, those are tough, tough people!  Seal/whale oil lamps provide light and heat.  They likely have animal pelts- seal, bear, on the floor and as blankets and get a good night's sleep.
Until they melt. 
They last for quite a while. Archeologists keep finding igloos after digging a long time in remote areas of Antartica.  EDIT: The interest is really wholesome. I'm afraid my comment is just a joke. 
They had summer and winter homes that were made of different materials (sod, bone, rocks, hides). Igloos were temporary hunting dwellings.
Maybe to do with conserving the small amount of heat they are generating, but just a guess really.

Shrimp. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it.
The shape of a traditional igloo actually does help trap heat inside! That packed snow is great insulation because it traps a lot of air. As far as the shape, you would have two elevations inside. You would rest in the higher part where all the hot air goes, while the cold air gathers at the bottom. (Edit: you would use part of the inside of the igloo for structural blocks. This is where two elevations come from. You rest at ground level next to a hole. The entrance is also this slow so you usually crawl in)   The heat in all of this is coming from you. The more people inside the quicker it gets hotter. Edit for clarification: if it's -50°F outside, your igloo can be as warm as 0-10°F. Some igloos might be lined with skins inside which could keep another 10°F inside.
Igloos are mainly used if you’re caught on the land without a way to get back to civilization I.E. your snowmobile breaks down. If you’re caught in a blizzard you’d usually make an snow cave in the side of a small hill and seal the entrance leaving a small hole for ventilation.   Source: I’m Inuk from Nunavut Canada
""" ah shit! A storm! Better start the 8 hour process of building this igloo!"""
I imagine they're still used for temporary shelter by native peoples in northern North America and russia
Those aren't igloos then lol
Recently saw a short movie about a couple of skiiers going to the South Pole to ski untouched lands.  They had to build one out of snow when their equipment alone wasn't good enough to handle a storm. They had to travel extremely light since they were basically traveling by foot... Ski...?  Edit: trailer for the film since people are asking   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TeNGfaAePgM
Even growing up in Midwest Winters I can't really even fathom how cold it gets in Arctic Canada. Forgive an ignorant American here. I imagine since you're on Reddit you have at least some modern conveniences on a daily basis. What parts of the day to day life might someone in suburban America find most unusual? Anything in particular you like to share with others about your culture?
Damn impressive
apparently they would bring in their dogs when it got cold (for more body warmth)  a night's temperature was described as a one dog night (cold), two dog night (very cold), or three dog night (extremely cold)
They will mold thier frozen feces into tools if they need to. Tough and resourceful.
r/technicallythetruth 
How are they finding igloos in an uninhabited continent 
Igloos are the teepees of the Inuit/Eskimos.
I think it’s more to cut down on the windchill factor. Owning chickens has taught me they can survive very low temperatures but only if sheltered from winds and moisture. I suspect the igloo does make it a tad warmer than the outdoors, but the greater impact is on windchill factor reduction.  Edit: I take that back, per Wikipedia: On the outside, temperatures may be as low as −45 °C (−49 °F), but on the inside the temperature may range from −7 °C (19 °F) to 16 °C (61 °F) when warmed by body heat alone.  That’s nuts!
You are supposed to pack it down with your feet first, typically where you are building the igloo and/or your general camp area. It's necessary to have enough snow, over 5 or 6 feet. Source: have built an igloo 4 times, have slept in an igloo 3 times. AMA
Truly resourceful people.
How long into winter does the snow become usable in making igloos? I wish our snow turned into styrofoam like that.
Wouldn’t it take too long to set up an igloo in an emergency? Feels like the ice caves you mentioned would be more effective.
Canada instituted a series of aggressive assimilation policies and removed children from parents (my father was taken when he was 5) for generations with the aim of eliminating our traditional culture, so today we are not so different from our southern Canadian neighbours. We are starting to reclaim our traditional practices and culture, but much was lost and many young people don’t speak the same language as our elders. Our environment is of course cold, but is warming very quickly with climate change, so that has made it difficult to relearn hunting skills because the sea ice is unpredictable and dangerous to travel on now. Hunting is still an important part of life, but now we use motor boats, snowmobiles and quads, and use rifles and naphtha camp stoves, etc.   I’m not going to lie, colonization and being forced from a semi-nomadic collectivist society to a sedentary wage based capitalist society has caused a shitload of problems for us and there is quite a bit of anger and bitterness because of it. Canada treats indigenous peoples like shit, and many of us would prefer to go back to our traditional ways, but that is no longer an option. 
Can someone explain the practicality of an igloo to me? Modern media led me to believe people live in these things but is it more of an oh shit kind of shelter? If not how do they keep warm? I know snow is a good insulator but obviously a fire wouldn't be practical
>three dog night  Man, I love that band! 
Like a...poop knife?
They’re that good.
It varies year to year especially lately but usually around late October on good years to mid November or early December on bad ones. Igloos aren’t usually used often up where I’m from aside from competitions or community get togethers for novelty reasons. There’s cabins every few Kilometers that can be used in emergencies around my area. 
Like I said depends on the emergency. If a storms brewing that you need shelter, then yes a snow cave is better. But if your machine breaks down you’d want to find the cabin, which usually have Coman stoves and provisions kept there as well as blankets nd possibly a radio. An igloo would suffice if you couldn’t find the cabin or had a long way to go before getting there and needed rest. They’re also usually checked first by search parties. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinzhee  these are way easier to make in survival situations imo
You realize that Minnesota is only about halfway up North America, right?
Think Canadian north
I had a similar question about the fire but I think I remember being told that even though the fire would melt the snow, the cold temperature of the outside basically freezes the snow or something so it would never lose it's structural integrity. It would be kinda similar to caulk for brick laying.  I'm not entirely sure if that's correct so hopefully someone else can answer this.  Edit: The builders leave a small hole in the top to let the smoke escape but they rarely need a fire if they have several people. Also, the mass of the snow/ice of the igloo is much higher along with a high heat capacity compared to the air inside the igloo, it melts slowly.  
The dogs that inuits kept for sledding were already native to that climate, and an igloo isn't all that roomy when you consider that you and your gear  can't be touching the walls to avoid getting soaked. I have a maremma which isn't even a northern climate  dog and he goes out in -15 to -20 C weather to play, and doesn't come back in until he wants grub.
Tough and resourceful 
Cabins every few kilometers is a really good idea. I'm assuming there markers showing where they are? How would you find them?
**Quinzhee**  A quinzhee or quinzee  is a snow shelter that is made from a large pile of loose snow which is shaped then hollowed. This is in contrast to an igloo, which is built up from blocks of hard snow, and a snow cave, constructed by digging into the snow.  The word is of Athabaskan origin, and entered the English language by 1984. A quinzhee can be made for winter camping and survival purposes or for fun.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Except they have to 'rest' for two hours, so the igloo is faster, safer and stronger.
I don’t think you can really separate the historical mistreatments from the current ones, because we are still experiencing the direct impacts of those assimilationist policies today. Canada didn’t stop residential schools until the 1990s, and still have basically the same attitude towards us. As to what I think should be changed, well, actually following through on the crown’s obligations that were agreed to in our Nunavut Land Claim Agreement, and indigenous treaties in general would be a nice place to start. One big point of contention with the NLCA was Canada’s insistence on extinguishing our aboriginal title to our ancestral lands, and making us agree in perpetuity to never seek independence. Canada would not agree to any land claim unless we agreed to those clauses. The land claim agreement gave Canada the green light to plunder our resources, and they didn’t bother to try to live up to their end of the agreement. Everyone and their drunk uncle love to point out how much money indigenous peoples get from the government but never seem to realize that under the land claim agreement, the crown takes 98% of resource royalties from most of the mining and other industrial development on our lands.  We are not completely opposed to industrial development on our lands, but as the original inhabitants, we want Canada to abide by the principles of prior, informed, consent, and to have some semblance of control over what happens in our back yard. Instead, the government shits all over us, allows resource extraction corporations to operate in our lands with near impunity, doesn’t provide us with basic government services as stipulated in our land claim agreement and gaslights us about it constantly. We, like anyone else mostly want to live our lives free from people in a distant, foreign city controlling every aspect of our lives. We also want the right to self-determination, which has been aggressively denied to us. We want to be treated with basic dignity, and not to be exploited constantly. 
Inside an igloo, a candle even will raise the temperature significantly. I think they sometimes would make small fires in a larger igloo, but a lot of the time just the body heat of two people would get it pretty warm. It melts a thin layer on the inside of the igloo, which helps to seal the igloo more completely to air. 
Big boofy dogs are great. 
Mostly it’s common knowledge of the area and the landmarks surrounding our town. People don’t usually go out on the land here without someone who knows the area. You can also rent GPS devices with the locations mapped into them as well from local places
> Athabaskan   Sounds like a lisping Harry Potter prisoner
An igloo is faster because the snow has already “rested” due to the conditions. A quinzhee is what you build if the snow is not deep and compacted enough.    You don’t really need to wait 2 hours if the snow is cold enough and separates when you shovel it.   Also, If you shovel out the “floor” down to the ground first before you start to pile the snow it is usually ready to be hollowed out as soon as you are happy with the size of your pile.   Some old timer told me the latent “heat” from the bare forest floor help speed up the resting phase. When you throw it back into your pile, the more the granules of snow move against each other the better. You want every granule to be touching a new a different granule. It might be BS but I’ve always done it this way and it works.   I’ve  found that once you get sick and tired of piling snow, take a break, mark your wall thickness with sticks and the snow will be rested and good to go.   Source: I’ve built a bunch, slept in a few. 
Yeah and it depends on the size of the igloo but they probably build accordingly for that. I just read that they can get up to 32° Celsius and they can last up to a year. Pretty amazing if you ask me lol.

I can practically hear them going past...   sssssssss   *woosh*   BLIP BLIP BLIP
"As a motion graphics artist I can pretty much guarantee that this is inaccurate. ""30 fps"" looks way too choppy to be real 30 fps. 60fps looks too choppy as well, it should normally be smooth as butter. I'll be back to debunk tonight. "
60 fps vs 144 plz
Oh, it's this garbage .gif again. The gif itself doesn't run at 60 FPS or a multiple thereof. Secondly, the 30 FPS line rarely lines up with the 60 FPS line - this was done intentionally to make it look worse than it actually is.
I’m confused. Movies are generally at 24 frames per second but we don’t see that much stutter.   Edit: so many different explanations, I don’t even know what to think anymore. 
Nope.  It's 37 frames at a length of 740ms, so it's actually 50 FPS.
>Video: GIF  460x359 100fps [V: gif, bgra, 460x359]  Though it's definitely not at 100fps. And I'd guess .gif is terrible at very accurate timings.
The gif format has a minimum frame delay of 20 ms, so the maximum achievable framerate is 50 fps.   This example is bullshit on so many levels.
The bleeps, the sweeps and the creeps? 
>I can practically hear them going past...  >sssssssss  >woosh  >BLIP BLIP BLIP  Bullshit, the human ear cannot hear the difference between 60 and 30 fps
Looks like it's 50fps, confirmed using ffprobe (50fps) and Photoshop (0.02s delay per frame).  Edited to add: https://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates&count=3&background=none&pps=480 is an interesting way to demonstrate the differences between frame rates.
There's no motion blur of any kind, it's high-contrast graphics, and they're panning. This is basically the worst-case-scenario for smooth video.
Is there a NeedsMoreFPS bot like NeedsMoreJPG? 
Would only work if you had a 144Hz monitor
Here you can if you have a 144 Hz monitor: http://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates
"Question:   I didn't have a gaming PC. Didn't really notice the ""horrible"" 30 fps on my consoles. Then I got a gaming PC and got used to 100 fps +. Way better. Loved it. I set some of my games to run at 30 fps and it was HORRIBLE.   Months later I went back to my PS4. Yeah, 100 fps is better but the 30 fps didn't look that bad at all on my tv. It looks way worse on my monitor. Why is that?  "
One of the reasons is motion blur.
I can't believe I was lied to over the internet.
Which also means that the 15 is 12.5 fps and the 30 is 25 FPS
“I’m surrounded by assholes!”
> Edited to add: https://www.testufo.com/#test=framerates&count=3&background=none&pps=480 is an interesting way to demonstrate the differences between frame rates.  Not anymore since you linked it on reddit, it isn't.  
Smoother than butter.
I would appreciate a bot that makes GIF's shittier by lowering the framerate and resolution while increasing motion blur.
"Frame pacing.  And distance to screen.  And possibly input device.  But for me anyway, frame pacing is the big one.  I was playing the Witcher 3 on my 1070 at 4k, and I was like, ""wow, I don't remember this being capable of running at 60fps.""  Checked the settings and it was a proper 30fps lock.  I had the same experience with For Honor.  The vast majority of PC games have terrible frame pacing, though and it makes the frame rate look much worse than it is.  For the unititiated, frame pacing at its worst is when a game averages a certain framerate, but the moment-to-moment delivery of those frames are at a different rate.  For instance, if a game delivered one frame for .5 seconds, then gave you 29 new frames on every refresh of the monitor for the next .5 second, that would average to 30 fps.  But what you'd really be seeing is one frame at 2fps, and 29 frames at 60--which is going to look choppy as hell compared to 30 fps, with one frame delivered every 33ms.  [Digital Foundry covers frame pacing a LOT](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-frame-rate-vs-frame-pacing)."

I will never de-bold the titles!
What is wrong with Calibri? Are you saying I should go back to Comic Sans?
Yes, let's remove all relevant data by rounding those numbers into oblivion. 
I work in Word virtually every day, often with tables, and often with specific data. I'm also a graphic designer. I also have to follow section-508 compliance on the PDFs I generate from the Word docs.  * Keep the grid. It helps guide the eye. * Increase cell padding to create more breathing room. * Make the alternating color rows white with a subtle color. Use even, not odd coloring. The first non-header row should be the lighter color. * I prefer specific data, but I would at least use the same number of decimals for consistency. * Vertically center the header row. I prefer horizontally-centered header text as well, regardless of the alignment below. * Simplifying the first column requires merging cells or leaving blank cells, which aren't 508 compliant for the seeing impaired to navigate without creating a complex table. * The finished design gives no hierarchy to the header row besides a dividing line. At least bold the text.  Lastly, the starting table is more relaying standard data, whereas the other design is attempting to be artsy for something like an annual report. They're kind of apples to oranges imo--going out of the way to create row gaps between face, heel, and jobber, for example. I do agree with nixing Calibri though.  **Edit:** Slow day.. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/zsrrC6w.jpg) my preferred take on the table--placed in the middle of the other options. I tend to center simple words, but the *Year of the...* column could go either way.  **Edit 2:** Why drop calibri? It's too soft imo. The details of the font get lost at smaller sizes, and I'm not a fan of how the details get dithered/aliased/whatever it's called. This is super arbitrary though..both are terrible fonts when it comes to trying to make something look pretty, but they serve the purpose of sending standardized data that gets transferred a lot.
I disagree with 75% of the changes made
As a fine furniture hobbyist, I'm super disappointed in the headline. 
>Let me just draw some grid lines with a ruler, or at least add some alternating highlights so I can tell which data point is for which row.  -Me when I get this paper handed to me.
I've worked in quality control a few years. There's no universal best way to present data. You have to trailer everything to the knowledge, experience, and preferences of the people who will be using your data.
As a dyslexic person: please do almost nothing from the first half of this. Keep the colour, it helps me keep track of rows. Gridlines and fills are also extremely useful. Calibri sucks, though; please use Arial or, if you're feeling generous and don't mind the hate, Comic Sans. As a quick rule, check if something helps distinguish the data from surrounding text. If so, please leave it in place. How pretty or minimalist your chart is doesn't help 10% of the populace read it.
this is bad advice 
 really thought thats where this was going
That's basically what they do by removing the grid, it stops being a table and starts being this horrible annoying thing you've got to follow across with a finger. 
As someone who designs charts and tables like this for a living, I generally add color back in.  I can disagree with almost all of that, but it depends on the usage of the chart/table. What if it's on a background? What if it's a small part of a larger layout? What if there's other more (or less) important text on the page? What if it's going to be animated in? What if you need to keep it consistent with other previous shitty branding?  It really also depends on the Data. What if one column is more important? Or alternate rows are important?  In my job, what if we can ditch the chart altogether and create an infographic/animation to replace it?
Whilst this is true, some people *really* go overboard with the colour. 
"I use to make charts for a ""small"" insurance company that would be literally hundreds of rows long.  The color and grids were basically necessary to be able to find information. "
Some things are just sacred, man.
Yeah this I'm in support of. Bold headings are useful, if not simply a way to further contrast the top row with the rest of the table.
I like papyrus for excel spreadsheets because then I don't get asked to make spreadsheets anymore
Seriously, Calibri is a very readable font. It's pleasant and doesn't really add much character, which is exactly what you want in a table.
There's nothing wrong with Calibri.
Like cutting the corners off a square and still calling it a square.
Seriously. This gif really overestimates how useful rounding can be.   Yes, keep your sigfigs consistent. But sigfigs will be determined by the instruments, size of numbers and math, not the cleanliness. 
"> I prefer specific data, but I would at least use the same number of decimals for consistency.  Why do you include two decimal places for ""number of fans? When will you ever have half a fan in that column? Isn't this superfluous, distracting detail that provides no value?"
"If you replace the title with ""how to turn your useful tables into a minimalist art project"" it makes more sense.   Whoever made this clearly thinks tables are just shapes and doesnt realize how to use them or what theyre for."
> There's no universal best way to ___________  Truly, the most important lesson here.  
Reminded me of this: http://imgur.com/Qr2ueBi
me too!
Yeah, this is how to make tables *more* terrible, not less.
"Yeah, they had some good suggestions with formatting, but a lot of the ""suggestions"" are kinda dumb.  I work as a data scientist, so presenting things like this is part of what I get paid to do, and I *generally* wouldn't do things like remove shading or going greyscale when presenting a table, as those things (when used properly) can help someone make sense of the table at a glance.    edit: adding wiggle room to my statements!  Yay for ambiguity!"
as a data analyst i prefer zebra striping and lines. It helps the eyes in the long run, it's meant to be read line by line. 
Wait, are you saying [my project has too much?](http://i.imgur.com/c4H92eC.png)
One argument I've read against using bold at all is that bold text attracts the attention of the reader constantly while reading the rest of the page. It's probably minimal, but it distracts you when you're busy reading the rest of the content. Emphasis within the text is best in italics, emphasis for table titles can be done with just one horizontal separator, so bold isn't really a necessity and does more harm than good.  I don't know if I 100% agree, but I've stopped using bold at all and I feel like the overall look of my articles is better that way. I sometimes use a little bit of bold for presentation slides though, because in that particular situation, the fact that it attracts the attention of the reader constantly while the slide is up is sometimes exactly the intended effect :)
The fills are even more useful, so you can follow a line with your eyes. I'm ok with making them a little less pronounced, but removing them altogether? Jeez

Hey /u/RepDetec you awesome Reddit user. How are you? I hope you're having a good day.

I think it really depends on what the purpose of the table is.  If it is to introduce completely new info that is all of equal importance (like for students in a textbook), then I'd say the first version might be better... though it could still use some work.  If it is for use in a presentation where you are trying to persuade someone that X is better, then you would want to do whatever you can to get them to focus on X and the final version might be better.    I should know because I used to build tables.  Not chart-tables, furniture-tables.  Same thing really, only not.
Most of the advice is good. Removing grid-lines and background shading went a step too far, though.
Zebra stripe is there so you can look at other values on the row without using your finger. This is especially important when presenting where fingers can’t be used, like on a projector (not that it’s desired to present tabular data, but sometime it’s required).  I always stripe if the number of rows is reasonably large, just very subtly, just to assist the eye.
"One argument *for* bolding the headers is so that it is incredibly clear that it is not part of the data.  Our brains first have to determine what we are looking at. Making the header row different gives our brains the cue ""look here first so you know what you're looking at"" - it's like the instructions for the table.  Not every set of data has headers - sometimes it's not clear if they *are* headers or not (depending on the data).  Example: https://i.imgur.com/wy8TdT1.png"
ESPECIALLY if you’re expressing any sort of technical data. Tried this after seeing the gif a couple years ago and my boss told me to add in grid lines and to add light grey background shading every other line because it can be very hard to read otherwise (and I completely agree with him).  I’m sure this gif works well for certain types of qualitative data but it should be taken as a suggestion on how to make certain tables cleaner than advice in general. 
Yea, this hipster shit gif only works on a tiny table of arbitrary data.  Yes let me put a fucking white space row in my data table, that will surely not fuck up all of the rest of the table.

Wow this is quite useful
All these years happily using and telling my friends to learn photoshop keyboard shortcuts and I never once thought about learning excel commands.   Man I can be thick headed sometimes. Thanks for this gif - it just got me to go and learn something new.
Saving this to never look at it again
FYI, the sum function- it isn’t necessary to highlight the data and the cell you want to show the sum unless there is other data above what you need.  Hitting alt+= in a blank cell will make excel search for numbers nearby.
"Excel shortcuts are awesome!  I've got a list of all of them on my site in the [""Master Workbook""](https://excelexposure.com/workbook/).   It also has all the functions and tons of examples!"
This was a flat earthers challenge “for $100,000”. Basically asked to prove this is possible and was proven wrong in minutes, plus he didn’t pay the money (obviously).   Edit: [Found](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-FJG65nbUO8) 
A flat earther will say: the egg is flat!!
"On large enough scales surveyors have to take this into account. IIRC ""Geodesics"" is what they call it. "
What is this shape called? Not a triangle any more I assume
This is what I learned at high school. I simply heard that it’s non-Euclidian geometry.
ITS SPHERICAL!!
Gavin was right all along!
The cool thing is that if you invert it then there can also be a pentagon that has five right angles!
I’m a pilot and when you get into navigation it makes it pretty clear pretty fast that the earth is flat. I mean, I don’t have to keep pushing down on the yoke and the curve I see outside is only because the windows are bendy. Come on guys accept the truth.
Brb got to move those goal posts....
I can look at this man and tell you he doesn't have $100 to spare, let alone $100,000
I really want to meet a flat-earther in person. Genuine flat-earthers are so bloody rare but every Reddit thread to do with anything round will have some stupid flat-earther joke in it.
Close, it’s called “Geodetic” surveying. This would only be done on quite massive scales and would be handled by an engineer.  Source: am surveyor
Shhhh. You'll scare Lovecraft. 
If they waver, then the flat earth will tip over and they will fall off
Of course - if they were the type of person who was open minded enough to change their stance based on the existence of proof, they wouldn't be flat earthers in the first place.  As unsatisfying as it is, it's impossible to flip a flat earther.
Bendy glass makes the plane fly smoother...it's just been an unintended consequence that people have mistaken that for the silly notion that the earth is a ball.   Everyone knows space is a puddle that the earth floats on. A heavy ball won't float, so we have to be flat or we'd sink.
I know you're just poking fun but it's these types of sarcastic comments that flat earthers take seriously and further reaffirms their belief. Kind of like how TheDonald started off as a satirical subreddit but turned into what it is today.
Haha the Flat Earther actually did in his response to this video. He said the challenge was to do it on *paper* flight charts, which aren’t used anymore. The pilot still has all his old paper flight charts from pre-smartphone/tablet era, and he promptly completes the challenge again. Still waiting for a response on that one. 
I’ve met one, and oh my god. I was part of a delegation sent on behalf of my union to national conference, he was also a delegate from another branch.   Genuinely believed the earth was flat, had an answer for every bit of proof I presented. It was almost comical, but very serious. He seemed to have a good grasp on the world, and had well reasoned answers.   Then he tried to tell me that Kentucky fried chicken had to change its name to KFC because they started using weird genetically lab grown “chickens” and they couldn’t say it was chicken anymore. And the government is trying to kill us due to overpopulation. (I asked him what he thought of some common conspiracy theory’s).   It was really really weird tbh, it was very obvious that he spent entirely too much time on the internet, bouncing ideas off other people.   I’m guessing you’d have met one, but had no idea they were a flat earthed. Every casual acquaintance you have, you don’t ask “do you know the earth is spherical”
So what is this called?  https://i.imgur.com/7biVBhN.jpg
Other ways to scare H.P. Lovecraft:  - Mention theres light on the electromagnetic spectrum we cant see, like infrared or ultraviolet (The Colour out of Space)  - Mention that air conditioning and refrigeration exist (Cool Air)  - Mention that sometimes a black person and a white person might actually love each other (too many to count, but most on the nose probably goes to The Shadow over Innosmoth)  - Mention that not white people have cultures too (also far too many to count, best on the nose example: The Call of Cthulhu)  - Mention that a new ruin of an ancient civilian discovered somewhere (Mountains of Madness)
Better not mention minorities then either 
Careful. Don't forget that islands like Guam can tip over if you get too many people on one point of it.
>It was really really weird tbh, it was very obvious that he spent entirely too much time on the internet, bouncing ideas off other people.   Uggh what a weirdo. Like.. who spends that much time on weird websites where all people do is read each other's comments.

Pac-Man
[For anyone that doesn't get the reference](https://youtu.be/cesSRfXqS1Q)  [And a great follow-up interview](https://youtu.be/Bi7s8jiaHBE)
Heh heh. Biangle. 
 Did you know the original name of Pac-man was Puck-man? You would think it's because Pac-Man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the Japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed. They changed it over here because Puck-Man is too easy to vandalize. You know, scratch out the P and turn it into an F or whatever? 
Nah, the record on his beliefs is pretty clear.  He was horribly racist but it did stem from fear.  He was terrified that all these non-white people would corrupt the right and honorable societies they invaded.    Also, Niggerman as a name for an animal is definitely racist, but probably more common that you'd expect in his time period.    He didn't go out and firebomb churches, he hid in his house afraid to leave it.
He took that interview like a champ. Dumbass or not that's an impressive way to handle being called retarded out of the blue like that.
No. You know what Pac stands for? PAC. Program and Control. He’s Program and Control Man. The whole thing’s a metaphor. All he can do is consume. He’s pursued by demons that are probably just in his own head. And even if he does manage to escape by slipping out one side of the maze, what happens? He comes right back in the other side. People think it’s a happy game. It’s not a happy game. It’s a fucking nightmare world. And the worst thing is? It’s real and we live in it.

I’m so ambivalent about octopuses. On the one hand, they’re an incredibly smart and adaptive species. On the other hand, they are *so goddamn frightening*. Cant help but shiver everytime I see a video like this.  Getting attacked/killed by an octopus has got to be my biggest (if unrealistic) fear.
Obligatory correction: the plural of octopus is octo*puses* or, because it's originally a Greek word, octo*podes*. Only Latin ***…us*** words get the ***…i*** plural.  ---  **Edit:** to quote Steven Pinker from his book Words and Rules:  >The attempt to foist ‘proper’ Greek and Latin plurals has bred pseudo-erudite horrors such as axia (more than one axiom), peni, rhinoceri, and [octopi]. It should be…octopuses. The -us in octopus is not the Latin noun ending that switches to -i in the plural, but the Greek pous (foot).
I'd hate to be watching this while taking a crap
They look like they’d feel like my scrotum.
How big are their brains, and are they structured particularly different to mammal brains? Reason I’m asking is, bones aside, I imagine squeezing a human brain through a smol hole would do considerable damage to it. Are octopus organs and brains specialised to be resilient(/extra squishy)?
I'd like a Disney movie about an octopus with claustrophobia please
>[Octopuses have three hearts; a systemic heart that circulates blood round the body and two branchial hearts that pump it through each of the two gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus)  Regarding the brain:  > [Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons are found in the nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain.[48] Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in their brain via an internal somatotopic map of its body, instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus)  Basically they have evolved to be non-centralized in their vital organs and so can operate this way without issue or damage.
Yes, they use it to peck seeds
Apparently they don't really have a single large brain but instead multiple 'brains' within their body and legs. I read something recently that said their legs are all independent but work together within the nervous system
Disney Pixar presents:  *Suction*  A story of a teenage octopus who must face her fears to save her friends, while making some other unexpected pals along the way. In theaters December 2020. Rated R.
And insects out of the sky.
They still have a central brain, and each of their arms has a dedicated ganglion cluster (not really a brain) that controls its movement. Basically, the arms are autonomous and make decisions independently from the brain.  EDIT: Anyone who thinks that octopuses are cool should read the book *Children of Ruin.* It deals with aliens that evolved from octopuses.
> Suction  > Rated R  I do not like where Disney is going with this film.
Octopus are like what I had imagined aliens to be like.
Area 51 is just a really exclusive aquarium.
The Hawaiians have a mythology in which the Earth is destroyed and repopulated multiple times.   The octopus is the lone survivor of the previous, alien Earth.

Anyway, Attin beamed a nasty one that curved center goal, (now, you could hear the crack of that kick, and Attin had thighs like watermelon, and glutes like cantelope, this dude did not skip leg day at all) so E-man stuck his arm out to block it an we heard a *snap* we pretty much knew we had a broken forearm on our hands. 
Ya but think of how much fun your neighbors will have watching you flop arond on the front lawn.
The bumps should go all the way to the ground though so the ball can come from where it would be kicked by a player.
The point isn’t to predict the path of the ball it’s to train your reaction time
You guys have girlfriends?
Players don't usually kick that close to the goal though
And money too?
Well players also aren’t usually large white walls with bumps all over them either that kick slow bounce shots. I was under the impression that this drill was to help with reaction time moreso than to simulate an actual player kicking a ball at you 
Where can I buy one of these I want to put it in my office. I'm dead serious.
Remember kids : squatting makes you look like an idiot today, but you will not look like a hunchback tomorrow. 
The gif is correct in the fact that it's less stressful to lift the load when it's closer to you, however as a PT, the worst thing I see is general population end up all on their toes in a squatting motion lifting things because they're told to lift with their legs. Then they start losing the kinesthetic awareness to hip hinge and end up never, ever stressing the lower back at all. This is bad. Because then the lower back doesn't get stronger, it gets weaker and more injury prone. Bending over to pick something up is fine and beneficial for the back, as long as it's held in a neutral position throughout lifting, and not a flexed position (which will put pressure on the discs).
I know a guy who worked in a butcher shop (picking up/moving heavy meat) for 40 years and ended up throwing out his back picking a pencil up off the floor. So ALWAYS lift with your legs! Edit: had the most important part backwards.
Dudes got a real stick up his ass...
This is not really correct.   In general, you want the moment arm as small as possible, thus lifting like this, with the weight between (and thus over) mid-foot limits torque, but there are still moment arms to the hips and knees.   Deadlifting is safe for the back, as you should stabilize the spine with a valsalva and hinge the hips. You can lift way more weight with a deadlift than basically a front/goblet squat.   In this clip, the first “wrong” move is wrong because the weight is not in the right position with respect to the midfoot. A deadlift like this would indeed be difficult.   That said, injuries tend to happen when the spine is not stabilized in an atomic position. This usually occurs when twisting or unbalanced. So use whatever method you want, just keep the spine stable, and recognize that deadlifting is better.   Source: am doctor, have herniated discs in past, now lift very heavy weights correctly. Also, have watched people lift heavy ass rocks. 
Holy crap.  Never mind. [lifting manikin](https://www.gtsimulators.com/Lifting-Demonstration-Figure-Lifting-Manikin-p/espzkj310k.htm) 
It's completely wrong though! Your back is the strongest muscle in your body! You should lift in one jerking motion, remembering to inhale on the way up. And don't forget to lock those knees!

When I worked in a warehouse I used to get made fun mercilessly for lifting kegs like this, wearing a backbrace and gloves. Non union shops rarely invest in creating a culture of safety.
Yeah... What are we supposed to do man??
*proceeds to purchase $400 sneakers*
It's probably targeted toward large companies trying to demonstrate good lifting practices to their workers. At my work I don't even need approval to buy anything under $1000.  $400 is nothing when your budget is $10 million and anything involving safety gets a green light anyways.
buying this makes it easier to lift your wallet ;)
[Hip hinge](https://drjohnrusin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/squat-vs-hinge-800x418.jpg), don't squat the weight.
Personally I feel that even $400 sneakers are a better investment than a lifting manikin, considering practicality and whatnot 
Everything in industry is overpriced. I recall working for a construction company on a major LNG project in Western Australia and seeing the prices for the Hi-Viz uniforms issued to every single staff member (8000 at peak construction)  Prices in Australian Dollars  $225 for a pair of work pants with two reflective strips  $225 for one embroidered hi-viz shirt with reflective straps  $220 for a pair of steel cap work boots  Every person given 5 shirts, 5 pants and one pair of boots, replaced every 12 months regardless of condition. And, a rain jacket priced at $300 every winter (embroidered and hi-viz)  $2770 per year per employee just for the bare minimum uniform. Don’t even get me started on PPE like gloves, hard hats and glasses...
I'm going to end up unintentionally twerking when I put this into practice.

Like here is a [full size da Vinci bridge with a floor installed on it](https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/lead_n_spotlight/631942_title__65043_w40pxTZun.jpg).

Well, if any one of the small cross members doesn't have enough frictional force to keep it in place, you at best lose a foothold and some structural integrity and at worst fall to the ground

Holy shit my elementary school had one of those on the playground and we always thought it looked cool but we never understood why there was a random bridge in the middle of the grass. That’s so awesome!
Always move quickly in jerking motions so you don't waste energy. 
Ah yes, everyone had free time back then which is why Leonardo da Vinci is just known as one minor inventor/artist among many thousands.
Exactly, the only blatant design flaw is that the bridge relies almost entirely on the friction between the four points it touches the ground and the ground itself. While the friction between each other piece of wood and the strength of the dowel rods are important, most of it relies on the feet. On grass and mounded dirt, this bridge has excellent efficiency, but on smooth concrete or ice, it would collapse with little to no weight.  Source: I’m an Astrophysicist  Edit: I see a lot of people commenting “how does Astrophysics have anything to do with this bridge design.” In order to get a degree in any field of physics, you must take the same foundation courses as most engineers (and they all involve friction in some way, shape, or form). Engineering, Physics, and Mathematics degrees share a lot of the same classes, and each person in those specified fields have a great understanding of what each other is supposed to do, the only differences involve the duties they have further into their careers and what their specializations include.
Most DaVinci bridges I've seen cut a notch or glue a tab on the main members to hold the bridging. 
"I lived all my young life in the countryside of the UK and as soon as I saw that it brought back memories. Similar to you, I had no idea it was a ""thing"" and just assumed it was an aesthetics touch they'd added.  "
Indeed, it’s this lack of friction and a steady father figure that leads this bridge to blowing guys at truck stops.   Source: I’m an astropsychiatrist
I don’t think so. It relies on the friction of the dowel rods. The feet on the floor aren’t held in place by friction. On ice, putting a weight on top of the bridge would increase the friction on the rods as the legs try to slide outwards.   Source: Mechanical Engineer

This has to be a thing. Since we can destroy trees so quickly, we should also be able to develop technology to regrow them quickly too.
It's a great idea, but I'm fairly certain this is just someone's presentation from a university class and this isn't currently being pursued.
Someone tell me why this isn't viable - its inevitable for posts that seem too good to be true like this
"Better start ASAP, Global Warming accelerating at an alarming pace...  Plus, we got Bolsonado bent on gutting the lungs of our planet..   Try and convince Donald ""I'm like, a smart person"" and ""Global Warming is a Chinese Hoax"" Trump to use this technology..."
We can plant them quickly but they still won’t grow very fast.
"It amuses me that someone thought it necessary to make a fully 3d gif to explain the idea of ""drop seeds from a drone"""
[Nope, it’s a real thing](https://youtu.be/EkNdrTZ7CG4)
Basically the chance that the seed actually sprouts (not eaten by birds etc), and the cost.  I visited a plantation once, and they grow the shoots in greenhouses until they're about 8 inches tall. then a guy walks in a line and just plants them with a tool like [this](https://youtu.be/FG_dXoo1Keo?t=19). One handed operation (doesnt need a yard stick) and the chances of them surviving is quite high. [better example](https://youtu.be/hOB4r22yDvg?t=85)
This  Yeah, its great that we are planting almost as many trees as we are destroying, but thats not the same thing as saving forests. These areas have spent millions of years creating a biodiversity that we barely understand. You cant recreate that in just a few years time
"I work in engineering.  I design parts and run all kinds of heat, stress, impact, cyclic load and weathering analysis.  Half of my time is spent making something ""look good for the customer."" 3D sells, especially to the old guys who haven't done real work in decades."
"All of this tech exists already.  First, the ""small"" drone they show in this animation only represents a drone. It  could be any other suitable drone, of which there are tons.  Second, having a local station with a lot of batteries and some solar panels and an automatic switcher of cartridges sounds like a rather simple solution if you ask me.  Finally, the pod the seeds are in is biodegradable, so it will just dissolve while the seeds grow."

Til: close ups are filmed by being close. 
But how are the close ups of the people shooting the close ups of birds filmed?
How come they don't get spooked and fly off?
This is a guy who raised the birds he’s filming. Can’t remember the name offhand, but Is relatively well known for doing so. An ultralight would scare wild birds.  Edited: I removed the word geese and replaced it with birds. Because I’m a lazy bastard that couldn’t remember the name of the bird species. 
where is this being filmed? 
The surprising bit is that it's actually a manned aircraft and not a drone.
Closeupception
Obviously they mounted cameras in the birds' eyes.
Mandatory [explanation](https://amp.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cmwov/hey_reddit_what_tattoos_do_you_have/c0tpyls/)
There’s a comment below this one about the same thing I was going to tell you. There’s a guy that trained geese to fly with him so they could migrate together! Watch that video, it’s fascinating!
They already are lmao they aint quick enough
Venezia,Italy
tbh, i would have been surprised if it was a drone   was expecting some kind of glider
The last time I watched a film about geese flying alongside a glider was when I was a child and it made me cry. Not making that mistake again.  Also geese are assholes. 
Venice for English speaking people...  Venezia is how it's spelled in Italian.
What was that 90’s movie where the girl raised the baby geese and then flew with them? I think it was Disney 
fly away home
Don't know what's more impressive: that they figured out how to do this without killing the patient, or that the body recovers from these procedures by self-healing.
I had a brain tumor removed three years ago. It was right on my left frontal lobe, so they were able to just take a big flap of my forehead skin and create a window into my brain to take it out, much like this video. There was a slight chance that I could lose my speech temporarily but luckily I did not. However, the first 12 hours after the operation in the ICU were the most painful of my life. Some of the higher grade malignant tumors like glioblastoma can branch out into your brain more like the roots of a tree, making them not so easy to remove completely. I had a lower grade of this, but still nasty, so I go in for an MRI scan every three months to make sure nothing is going on in there. We'll see.
This made me feel very uncomfortable
My sister had a brain tumor. I thought my dad was exaggerating when he said it was the size of a baseball, but sure enough when I saw the scans it was.  Took her almost 8 months to recover and she has to go in for yearly checkups.   
So simple.  I feel like there may be more to it than the gif lets on.  e: grammar
I wonder whose responsibility it is to slurp the tumor up through a straw?
What's the second part? 
Doctors are fucking amazing they are everything I aspire to be . 
[The first part (craniotomy) IRL](https://i.imgur.com/x0MrkhN.gifv). Surgical GIF so prolly NSFW
Is it just me or does this gif hurt?
Neurosurgeon here. Probably the coolest things about these cases, and what makes them fun, is just how varied brain tumors are. Each one poses a unique challenge to the surgeon. Some tumors sit on the surface of the brain, easily identifiable. Others are deep inside and require creation of a safe passage through normal brain tissue to get at the tumor. Some tumors are soft and suck up our suction tubing like grape jelly. Other tumors are hard as rocks, requiring powerful ultrasound tools to essentially vaporize the tumor bit by bit. Some tumors are clearly distinct from brain tissue while others look identical to normal brain, and must be distinguished based on how the tissue feels through our instruments. Some tumors basically fall out of the head as soon as you free them, others are sticky and will wrap themselves around blood vessels and nerves requiring hours of tedious work to free them. The basic steps shown in these gifs can be learned within a neurosurgical residency, but learning the technical nuances of getting these things out of the brain takes many years beyond that.
Yikes, but good job doctors.  
I dont think they figured that out by cutting up alive patients...
I have a small one located behind my eye. They are just watching it for now, but removal would involve splitting my skull at its plates and unhinging it from my ear to my nose. I had fun watching my family cringe when I explained it.
Reminds me of the picture in this [article](https://www.zmescience.com/other/great-pics/zbigniew-religa-picture/)   This was a picture of Doctor Zbigniew Religa after the first heart transplant in Poland.    A quick history... heart transplants only started in 1964 and only 100 transplants were performed in 1967.  Only 1/3 of patients lived longer than 3 months.    Then cyclosporine was discovered in the 70s, and entered widespread usage in 1983s.  For those who dont know cyclosporine is a very powerful immune suppressing drug that drastically increases the changes a transplant will take.   After that the first successful pediatric transplant was done in 1984 on a 4 year old boy.    Today, just 34 years after the first successful pediatric transplant, 3500 heart transplants are performed a year.  On top of that one thing that may professionals believe is possible is that in the future we can make artifical organs and wont need human donors anymore. This means everyone who needs a transplant will receive one.    It's things like brain surgery, heart surgery, transplantation, and future possibilities that make me hope reincarnation is a real thing.  I would love to see where the world is in 100-200 years. 
How does someone even know if they have one? Is there obvious symptoms like pains or headaches? It's like a serious irrational fear of mine. EDIT: I'm even more paranoid now. 
Every year at HOSA (healthcare organization) state conference, there’s a showing of an open heart surgery. You wouldn’t believe how much blood there was. We went with three people to see it. One felt like she was going to throw up, I was in your camp of being uncomfortable (but intrigued enough to stick around), and the third was excited and she wants to see it again this year.
My brother does too. I don't know what the procedure was, but he has a scar on the side of his head and has a tube that goes from his head to his brain for drainage or something.   He was always so sick as a kid. He had to lay down a lot and couldn't stand loud noises. At school he would mostly be in the teachers lounge with support and he would lay down until my mom came to get him almost every day. Yet he hardly ever complained about anything.  And he was always picked on because of his head size (side with the tumor was noticably bigger). He's very quiet and antisocia because of his childhood. I love him and I wish I understood what he was going through when I was a kid so I could help him back then, but our relationship has been closer once I realized it.   Edit: Hi guys, thanks for all of the comments! Unfortunately I'm starting to get a little depressed when I come back to this thinking about his childhood. Going to turn off notifications, but seriously thank you guys for the support
Right, I just need a tiny attachment for my shop vac, and some new dremel bits and I could totally do this. 
Of course, the tumor isn't white like that and doesn't just plop out after cutting a bit along the edge.
The zombie-assistant.
I giggled watching the gif as my (hopefully non-entumored) brain inserted the 'alllllllmost-empty-milkshake' sound.
The second part is a different kind of tumor removal. I believe it’s referred to as an ~~intra-sphenoidal~~ transsphenoidal approach. Basically you go up the nose and through the sphenoid sinus (which is one of the compartments in your skull that stores mucus to humidify air going through your nostrils).   I know that approach is used to take out tumors on the front, lower part of your brain such as a tumor of the pituitary gland. Stuff that would be hard to get to from the side of your skull. 
Medical school is hard for a reason.
Hey, I made that GIF. Nice.  Check out r/SurgeryGifs for more.
Unit 731 / Nazi's definitely did
r/restofthefuckingowl
Wow... just wanted to say that I feel for you and your family and I hope it is either extremely slow-growing or resolves. 
Chemo treatment to the brain? I thought doctors had a real hard time getting across the blood brain barrier. We know so little about the brain because of this, it makes observing live patients very difficult. Or there's unit 731
There is no easy way to tell other than having an MRI. In some cases patients can exhibit symptoms like what you mentioned. In my case, I had zero symptoms up until I had a minor seizure. My doctors figured that the, then, baseball-sized tumor had been growing over a period of ~10 years.
I was literally varsity quarterback for my High School and felt sick one day before a game. I thought it was an infection of sorts, so I went to an Urgicare to get looked at. Turned out it was Mono, but the NP recommended I get a CT scan to see if my tonsils were swollen. During that someone was on the ball and looked up at my head. Lo and behold there was a mass right there in my cerebellum. Thats the part of your brain that controls coordination and movement, so it came as a shock to me because I was so fit and active. You really can't know these things unless you're checked for it.
It’s the friends that are excited about blood that freak me out. “What, you’ve never seen blood before?” “It’s just a little blood, come on!” “Everybody bleeds! Don’t you love blood?” “Let’s bleed again next year! I loved this blood expo!”
> You wouldn’t believe how much blood there was.  I assume there's quite a lot of blood involved when you do surgery on the organ that pumps all of it.  That's like saying you saw a sewage plant repair and we wouldn't believe how much shit there was.
How's he doing now?
Both. The tumor left a big empty space in her head, which mean her brain had to re-expand to fill it out. If that happened all at once it would kill her, so they had to monitor the brain going back into place. There was a ton of excess fluid as well that they had to drain. She had awful headache, dizziness, and cognitive problems during this time. Lucky not brain damage tho!! She'll never be able to go roller coaster again, so that sucks. But she's alive so I guess it's a fair trade.
As long as they're clean and you got steady hands
amazing how the fuck are their instruments ong and bendy enough to do that and more amazingly how in the fuck do they see what they're doing 
"Yeah, that's the conflicting part about that whole ordeal.  A lot of modern techniques and knowledge of medicine is ""thanks to"" completely fucked up shit that those guys did to prisoners.  It's like the pinnacle of the philosophical question, ""do the ends justify the means?"""
Neither of those groups did testing like this.  Each group did human experiments, covering things like: exposure to extreme temperatures, toxins, poisons; ability to live after having organs and tissues damaged,removed, etc.   What they didn’t do is attempt to remove brain tumors in the least damaging way. 
It's been weird because I started having pain anytime I was at work. It was extremely stressful job running a store and I got no support from the owner, leading up to constant pain and taking maximum doses of pain killer every day just to get by. After about 3 weeks on pain killers I decided to leave the job and get out of a bad situation. The day I put in my notice to leave and the two weeks until I left I had no pain, and the pain hasn't come back since which was about 3 months ago.  I'm not sure if it has been there for years and is just now showing due to the stress, or what caused it. The doctors said it looks and acts similar to a tumor that appears in children from 5-10, most of which don't live long after. The only way to check is the biopsy I commented about originally, but that risks me losing part of my vision and wouldn't get rid of it completely. I just got through my first 90 days at my new job and actually have health insurance, something my previous job never offered, so we will see how everything is and decide what to do to fix it.
There are drugs now that do a pretty good job of crossing the barrier, like Avastin.  It's a crap shoot with glioblastomas though.
It amazes me that a baseball in your head can go unnoticed for 10 years. You’d imagine it would be in the way of *something*.
This made me laugh. Would be too if said person was not looking to be a surgeon (this was a healthcare conference after all)
He's fine, I just asked my mom. They didn't remove the tumor but the tube is to remove fluid from his head which prevents the headaches (fluid was pressing against his brain and the tumor). It unravels as he grows and he has yearly checkups but the situation has been controlled for years now.  He's your typically 20 year old lazy student now!  Edit: Although, he does struggle with depression and is very sensitive to new people which I think stems from the constant bullying he had throughout middle school
And you can tell which bits are the good ones and which bits are the bad ones.
You use a scope! It's like a colonoscopy in your nose! An ear, nose, and throat surgeon (otolaryngologist) usually does the sinus part, then a neurosurgeon takes over to remove the brain tumor
I'm Canadian, I was joking. sorry eh
Well you know what they say, if you want to make an omelette you’ve got to do horrible experiments on POWs!   
Ive heard that there isn’t any useable knowledge from those tests as they were not very well run experiments 
That is largely a myth. Almost all nazi/ Japanese 'medical experiments', war crimes and torture more accurately, were so scientifically negligent and outrageous there was litte, if anything at all, to learn from them. 
Don't forget skin melting temperature and twin telepathy
Tumors does not follow any regular growing pattern. The tumor can be small until the right mutation happens and it gets the tools it needs to grow big in a very short time
Time to go have a full body scan so I can obsess over every tiny imperfection or normal anatomical variation
Just grab the ones with the least amount of rust and you're good to go
> You use a scope! Its like a colonoscopy in your nose!   If you're lucky they'll have washed it beforehand
Isn't that saying that the ends do justify the means? Because people were experimented on in the past, people today can live better lives. 
Just like great great grandma Eichmann used to say!
The bulk of the experiments were tainted with racial bias and oriented around torture and horrific premises. But it wasn't completely useless, just 99.9999999% useless. There's some discussion about it in r/askscience, like [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/mtwfr/did_dr_mengele_actually_make_any_significant/) which suggests some of the Nazi experiments regarding pressure and the human body was useful in space research later.  That is not to say that the cost was worth it. Anyone with a conscience should be able to agree that it was not. And in case anyone needs to be reminded that real people suffered horribly in these experiments, [here is an AMA with Eva Mozes Kor](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xt5bb/iama_survivor_of_medical_experiments_performed_on/).
But skin doesn't melt. It just burns. 
Tumors are so gross. They should just stop.
Not exactly, if we were to recognize the ends justify the means then we would be saying it was morally alright and could be necessary again. What they’re saying is to abandon the research on the grounds of morality would have been a waste since it could be used to save lives. Difference between condoning the work that was done and just utilizing the research because of the discoveries.
You can't get a negative or positive conclusion from a poorly run experiment: you simply can't draw any conclusions at all.  And what new experiments do you think will be inspired from that war? Changing the amount of time we expose infants to extreme cold? Altering the order we remove organs from a live patient? How about exposing a pregnant woman high doses of radiation only during the third trimester? 
Well thanks you nazis
No, melting is accurate word for describing certain kinds of skin trauma.  You can pour boiling water on your foot causing the skin on your toes to fuse together and the final character of the damage is different than if I were to char your foot by placing a red hot piece of metal on it.  Yes the water damage is still a burn but it is also for the lack of a better word, melting.

Then they will be punished.
I've always wondered how they can be recycled if they have this? Does anyone know?
Life hack: never pay for condoms again
If you're going to try this, make sure to do it outdoors. This reaction produces a good amount of (flammable) hydrogen gas.
Im trying this at home
Just how I like my coke in a bag.
That inner lining is typically sprayed on after the can  is manufactured. Without the lid of course. As stated, it’s to protect the beverage from contracting metallic taste. Different beverages require different amount of lining depending on the acidity of the beverage.   Beer for example has a lot less of a lining when compared the battery acid that is monster energy drinks.   Source: I work in the beverage industry
So you got 2 cocacola in price of 1? Neat!
The inner film? Same as the coating on it: you would just burn it off I imagine. Aluminum has a much higher melting point than most plastics degradation temp, so they could just melt it and remove the burned impurities.
The BPA gets burned off during the recycling process.
My face and personality already have that problem solved.
We used to put a balloon over it, let it fill then FOOOOM! Bright hydrogen flash.  We were bad children.
Also drink the Coke afterwards and tell us what colors you can hear.
Report results. After watching some yt vids debunking this kind of stuff, I’m a little skeptical. I also sucked at chemistry.
I think it's to keep it from blowing up from the heat of the chemical reaction.
Heat from the melt is circulated to preheat the aluminum to burn off the outer enamel and inner coating before it enters the furnace, but even more importantly, dry the metal out.
Wait.  BPA?

Yup. There’s no other step to remove it, so it gets incinerated.
Nice. All the smoky plastic will go up into space and make new stars.

*Tyrannosaur tooth fossil      **Edit:** Credit to @Palaeoart on Instagram for the source video.
I could be wrong but I believe they typically don’t display the actual specimens, I think they prefer to make casts of the fossils and display those and store the fossils themselves so that they don’t get damaged.
This is super neato! I would be so nervous working with anything that old, especially using that powered spinny. 
I would stick it up my ass. Not because i would enjoy or because i do these things on the regular... But i would be 100% sure that i would be the first and maybe only homo sapien to experience a dinosaur tooth in his ass. History! Life complete. 
I know I'm gonna sound stupid for saying this but I'm surprised it's not like 10x bigger. 
I remember as a kid thinking I owned a genuine T-Rex tooth and raptor claw from a nature store at my local mall. It was so deceptive!!
That’s what glue is for. As a paleontology intern, I learned that some kinds of fossils are brittle, fragile things. I cracked a triceratops frill in half and my supervisor handed me a bottle of “jurrasic gel” and “paleo paste,” glues made specifically for putting fossils back together.
/r/kenm 
tough to get those inbetween spaces when you have tiny arms
So not a real tooth right? It looked more like a rock. I wonder how long a tooth could last. 
Generally yes, but there are a few exceptions. The natural history museum in NYC has a full-sized T-rex cast, but next to it is the actual fossil of the skull in a glass case.
My brother found a fossilized baby megalodon tooth in a lake we frequent when we were kids, so about 17 years ago.   Last year I wanted to take some pictures of it and I dropped it and broke a decent chunk of the top off.   So far I don’t think anyone has noticed but I dropped a tooth that’s millions of years old and BROKE IT.   I have since learned not to touch anything.   Proof:  [Baby megalodon tooth](https://imgur.com/a/mBfuko5)   Edit: we took it to a museum to see what it was (where we found out it was a megalodon tooth) and they told us to keep it because there are an abundance of fossilized shark teeth and my brother was like 10 when he found it. They probably wanted to keep him interested in the sciences (spoiler: he isn’t)  Fun fact - we were skipping rocks at the lake and he found it just off the shore. He was about to throw it until he felt the serrated edges and looked at it closer.   Found at Lake Castaic, California
That makes a lot of sense. 
Tyrannosaur doesn't necessarily mean Rex. Could be a much smaller cousin, or an adolescent.
And serrated teeth shred the floss
"A fossil tooth like this one is a real tooth that has mineralized into a ""rock"" over millions of years."
i always figured if its not in a case protected from the hands of visitors it's not authentic 
I think this is a Tyrannosaurs Alan.     Edit: This is my [2nd Alan comment lately](https://www.reddit.com/r/likeus/comments/8ve35f/are_you_kidding_me/e1mqwfd/) that has gained significant karma. (different spelling though). Feel free to upvote my other comment if you like my work. 
With that kind of fossil, in the state that it was in, it was kind of expected. Some of the specimens they gave me looked pretty much like piles of rocks and dust, to be put back together like a 3D jigsaw puzzle. 
[This hard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnun8y7r8_U)
I just emailed the natural history curator at my state museum, which was in the same city as where I went to college. Told him I was interested in museum studies and natural history. Maybe I was just really lucky, but he emailed me back, gave me a tour of the museum and labs, and asked when I wanted to start. It was unpaid, of course, but that didn't matter to me because of how cool it was.
And the wife
Doesn't really take that long to fossilize so long as it's covered quickly and pressurized. After that it's just a matter of the available minerals and the size of what's being fossilized that's variable in timing.
Put it in a case so I know it's real
Sodium bicarbonate might not work as well, but dolomite.
To shreds, you say?
Dino die. Dino meat and skin rot away. Dino bone remain. Dino bone get buried under sand/soil over many years. Dino bone pressed really hard by much sand and soil. Slowly minerals deposit onto bone, bone slowly diffuses away. Mineral remain, in Dino bone shape. Ship of Theseus happy, fossil ready.
in a few million years, the case will be a part of the fossil and we'll need another case.
I’d be worried that I accidentally forced the wrong puzzle pieces together. My T-Rex “puzzle” would look a little weird with its arm sticking out of its skull. 
if so, just claim that you've discovered a new species and call it a day.
>Not to be 'that guy',   What guy? The one who shares cool and interesting information? Thanks friend! 
Stop yelling! I get it!
Okay, but who the hell actually thinks that Antarctica is shaped like a sheet?
Mercator is still very useful. Every 2-D map projection has its tradeoffs. 
To call it a lie is a stretch. As stated, you can't map the surface of a sphere onto a rectangle without some distortion somewhere.  So why do we use the Mercater projection? Well, what's the primary purpose for maps in general? Navigation. This projection preserves relative angles, which is extremely useful for navigation, especially at sea. There are other projections that do a better job of showing area comparisons, but they sacrifice directional accuracy for it. This one is the best for navigation, which is why maps exist at all, and so that's why it's so popular.

"Learned a fair amount of this during Season 2 of the West Wing from the good folks at ""The Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality""."
Antarctica is still pretty fucking big.
This was fascinating. I knew it was distorted, but never how badly. 
Do many people outside the US use the Mercator projection? I’m from the UK and I think we were taught with [the Robinson projection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection#/media/File%3ARobinson_projection_SW.jpg) in school, but I could be wrong. Born in ‘93 if a switch happened and it’s relevant, but Mercator always looks so weird to me. 
Stupid question perhaps but are bodies of water equally distorted?
The language in general is more aggressive than necessary. The map isn't a lie but uses a certain system with certain disadvantages. 
"This gif is obnoxious as hell. Even calls the initial world map ""A TOTAL LIE"", which it really isn't if you didn't already know the earth is round. Very stupidly sensationalist. "
I remember being really annoyed the last time it was posted because of the typography. 
My ex thought Alaska was an island beside Hawaii. I'm sure there are people.
Flat earthers
If you want a map that's accurate in every way, you get a globe. You can't flatten a 3d sphere into 2d without distorting something somehow.
Exactly. This GIF is interesting, but it's also not entirely right in saying that the Mercator projection sucks.  Every map serves a purpose, the Mercator projection is useful because of how ubiquitous it's become. People can orientate themselves on it relatively easily.
" [Check out this animation I made](https://gfycat.com/JitteryEachFreshwatereel). I rotated the map around the prime meridian/international dateline to show how weird the map looks when you decouple the ""poles"" on the map from the poles on the Earth."
*It’s a stretch*
Came here to post this. Had to special order one from Japan for an original print but a very cool way of addressing some of the problems. 
W ^o b ^b l ^y Russia 
"I loved it when they made South the top of the map. ""You can't do that."" ""Why?"" ""Because it's freaking me out."""
Yeah it has to be big to surround the rest of the world.
Also obligatory [West Wing clip](https://youtu.be/eLqC3FNNOaI)
Yes. It has nothing to do with land or sea but with close to the equator or close to the poles. 
it's that stupid clickbait language
"That's what irritates me. Not only is it not a lie, they described it as ""total lie."" A map of Middle Earth being presented as the world would be a total lie. This is just unavoidable distortion. "
THERE IS NO WAY TO SHOW IT ON A MAP NOW LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE ON A MAP !!!
Isn’t the globe something you would learn in like 2nd grade science though?
Flat earthers believe that Antarctica is a ring of ice surrounding the disk, keeping the water from falling off
Ya the guy in the video was kind of a dick about it. Trying to present it like some huge cover up and he’s finally opening everyone’s eyes to the tremendous lie. 
They outright call it a lie. That was kind of funny though lol. 
My mom was diagnosed with buzzfeeditous last month and it’s been very rough. Everything is ‘MUST SEE’ and ‘YOU’LL NEVER GUESS WHICH’. She texts me every day in slideshow format. Even when my sister broke her arm and needed a doctor she sent me a text with 7 reasons why I needed to come over... my sister was reason 6.   It’s easy to get frustrated but we have to be patient with her. 
IIRC in most geography classes they go over the different map types and the pros and cons of each
"Not to mention it ends with ""NEVER TRUST A MAP"". Sensationalist nonsense."
Her excuse was that in all the maps she's seen of America in school it was always shown in the ocean beside Hawaii. And for frame of reference I live in Canada.. Its literally attached to us for fuck sakes.
"I mean to a certain extent, every map is a ""lie"" in the sense that no map really portrays reality.   ~~But yes, the gif was completely playing into the ""Mercator projection is racist"" meme.~~"
Doctors hate her!!
Sometimes on maps of the United States they show hawaii in a little box in the corner since it would actually be off the page. I could see how if you don't notice the box that it would appear it's much closer to Alaska.
Nah man there is pretty much no excuse for anybody in the US over 16 to not know that shit. Like how stupid do you really have to be? Even the most underfunded of schools in backwards ass states (read: Kansas) have a fucking globe or at least a world map from like 1971.   You literally have to try to not figure out basic geographic shit about your own country. I'm also surprised that people dont even think about that sort of stuff?? who as a kid can look at a map and not be super interested? this is the world you live on and its cool as fuck
Trucker here: This is why products made at the Bakersfield California Frito-Lay plant are not permitted to go Canada via Donner Pass on the I-80. We have to go through Oregon and then east.  Edit: Thank you for the Silver kind stranger. Very nice of you.  Edit: Gold too? Wow. Thanks very much.
So how do they deliver chips from sea level to, say, Denver?
Why is the pressure bar going up? The pressure in the bag is constant and the pressure outside is going down.
I live at just 800ft, but if I bring something like a bag of nuts from the nearest city which is sea level, it is noticeably puffed up
This makes it seem like the pressure INCREASES, but it actually DECREASES. That’s why the bag explodes - same amount of pressure inside but less outside.
Now *this* is interesting.
How do you get chips if you want to throw a Donner party?  Do you just starve up there?
Probably packaged at different heights. Or magic. Probably magic
Well, this popped at 3567m, which 11,700 feet. Denver, “the mile high city” is more like 5000-6000, basically 1/2 or about 1700 meters. The bag at that stage looked puffy, but not tight or strained.   Some air tight foods might be made locally, so there wouldn’t be an inflation at that altitude. If those same foods went down to sea level the bags would tighten/shrink (potentially damaging the chips).
The pressure bar represents the driver’s pressure to eat all the chips, until finally they cave and rip open the bag like a wild animal  Edit: Wow, first silver(s!) ever. Thanks kind strangers!
I also like to think my nutbag grows when I go into the city.
Pressure outside is decreasing, thus allowing the bag to expand
Perhaps you will like this as well: We get to see all the invoices and customs documentation on the freight we carry. Chips that sell for 5 bucks a bag in Canadian stores are listed on the paperwork as being imported for 60 cents US funds per unit. Bit of a markup wouldn't you say?
Woah woah woah it’s magic, you knowowoww  Packaging those Doritos!
A bit? A hefty bit, I’d say...   Yes, I do find that interesting.
Another hefty markup is cables at Best Buy (and other places). The employee discount takes a $40 hdmi cable to $2.33. Iphone charging cables (the better, Insignia brand) go from $30 for a 6ft to $2.79.
"Yeah I worked at Comp and was blown away at the markup on that shit. Prolly why they were constantly up our ass to sell accessories like mice and bags with laptops, we'd make like 1 buck on a laptop but make 90% margin on a stupid laptop bag.  The best was the TAP (extended warranties). Cost on those was like 2 bucks for employees, I knew a guy that rolled a 15"" 1024x768 lcd monitor into a 24"" 1080p set for just the cost of a new tap plan."
They left out the one where the dog is only using its front legs to drag its dirty butthole across the carpet. 
I wonder what the decision process was like concluding in adding the balls/penis into the silhouette. 
Okay, where in the world is it gallup and not gallop?
Was the source 60fps? It seems like at times some steps are missing.
~~gallop/run~~ zoomies
Why is gallop:  Both Rear  Front Left  Both Rear  Front Right  Front Left  Repeat  Do they really just use 1 front leg every other stride, or is the gif missing frames?
My dog has 3 legs, I showed this to him and he was not amused.

I like how respectful everyone is to the marathon 
Fascinating, but why wouldn’t they use a more visible (yellow or red) rope?

I always assumed you never could.
I’m waiting for that one person to jaywalk/run across both sides for dear life
This is the Boston Marathon. It's a huge deal and it's one of the most incredible and unique holidays anywhere.  The marathon kicks off early in the morning in Hopkington, and ends in Back Bay / Copley Square downtown.  The entire route is lined with people.   *The ENTIRE* route.   People cheer for anyone and everyone. Passing by a college is super loud, and kids get up and hold up clever signs.  Also the Sox play at home at 11am (weather permitting) that day, so right about the time the larger groups of better runners start passing through Kenmore Square down Comm Ave, the gates that were once 5 deep cheering are suddenly met with a deluge of 38,000 Fenway Faithful.  ALL the bars along the route are packed with people who got there at 8am to claim their spot.  Everyone cheers. You might not know anyone running but you're just cheering for people to make it. And the finish line coming down Comm Ave, Right onto Hereford St, left onto Boyslton, is a thundering sense of applause as the crowd gets you through the last 1/4 mile. It's just awesome.   Marathon Monday in Boston is an incredible and unique experience.
The people aren’t moving very fast it’s probably easier to see the people holding the rope
You just really made me want to run it. I just need to figure out how to shave 2 hours of my current marathon finish time :-(
Wait, are you saying this is sped up? 
"Try the Marine Corps Marathon (if you can get a slot). It's like that, only for terrible runners. There's no purse, so the winning time isn't amazing, and they leave the ""bridge"" (do or die point at 20 miles in) open for almost 6 hours, so your window to complete it is huge.  I finished (with the breakneck pace of 5:55... as in almost 6 hours, not a sub-6 minute mile) in front of ~12,000 or so entrants of the 32,000 running that year. There were people lining the whole route, including two groups with kegs handing out shots of beer after the bridge. Wonderful experience, and I can now say I did a marathon.  I *did* a marathon. I did not *run* a marathon."
Keep it up! You’re still marathons up on most of us!
Thanks man, I do like to write, but it's easy to describe it when it's such a visceral experience. You can feel like you're there because I *was* there, and being there is special.  There's just something special about that day. Maybe it's how the city swells with people from literally all over the world. Maybe it's because you know your buddies in NYC and Philly and LA all have to work that day. Maybe it's because it's one of the few times a Bloody Mary at 8:45am on a Monday in April doesn't make you an alcoholic, it makes you 45 mins behind schedule.  But the city *feels* like something.  The best Marathon Monday was the year after the bombings. There was something like fifteen or twenty thousand more runners that year because they allowed everyone who didn't get to finished the year before to re-run. And everyone was running for something, and running more than proving something to themselves, they were running against not just their own fear, but fear itself.  I went to the Sox game with my buddies that day, as is tradition.  And it was just gorgeous out.  Like every year, the big screen at Fenway has a small sidebar that shows the standings in the Marathon for everyone at the game to follow. The Kenyans were all among the top, as they always are. But in first was an Eritrean named Meb, who was an American Citizen running with the American Flag next to his name. They kept flashing to him and the stadium cheered.  An American of any stripe hasn't won the Boston Marathon in what, thirty years? What are the ods. Let's stay focused on the game guys.   But he's not falling back.  And then the big screen cuts the game to Meb turning right onto Hereford St, and then left onto Boylston. The final stretch. Lined by buildings and crowds. I wouldn't be surprised if Fenway could hear the crowd on Boylston, and Boylston could hear everyone at the Sox game cheering.  I don't even think the Umps called a time out in the game, everyone just stopped and watched.   The batter put his bat down, the Center Fielder turned to the screen and watched with his glove on his hip.  And goddamnit, Meb did it. That sand bagging sonofabitch. We watched as they placed the laurel wreath on his head and he wrapped himself in an American flag and cried. We all cried. Ever look around and smile at people without saying anything? It was that.  High fives, USA chants, goosebumps, and smiles.  A year after Boston was a War Zone it was soo full of love.  I don't even remember the final score, but goddamn I love that holiday.
"Congratulations! I finished mine in 5:51 - the important thing is that *we finished a freaking marathon*  That's huge! And I don't think you should diminish that feat by saying you didn't run it. There's no objective mile time to qualify as ""running"". Some people run 6 minute miles, some run 12 minute miles, some run 16 minute miles. If you can finish a marathon, you're a runner. So congratulations, I'm proud of you!"
what happened? I'm out of the loop
Apart from using his customized sharpie, ~~it looks like he signed in the wrong spot~~. But this video is ofc edited to make it funnier, you can see a longer, non edited version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvMzBQd91Ow)  Now that i look at it again, at 1:20 aren't the other 2 signatures switched as well on the 2 copies shown? And the page is a bit different.  EDIT: Here's an [high res image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-wordpress-client-uploads/tbt/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/30142354/NYT_TRADE_DEAL_4.jpg) of the other 2 signatures mirroring each other. After *further investigations,* Trump seems to have signed in the right spot in all 3 copies: see [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/gifsthatkeepongiving/comments/d7rn4m/the_look_on_the_faces_of_world_leaders_when_they/f16f1l2/?st=k0vydukn&sh=244c7d33)  from [TheSausageKing](https://old.reddit.com/user/TheSausageKing).
He is a simple man. He sees multiple signature spots, and his narcissism compels him to sign all of them.  Edit: I seem to be wrong about him signing all of the signature spots. But he definitely is a raging narcissist.
Ahh this is so cringey
I love how Justin Trudeau goes full Jim Halpert at the end. 🤣
"Trudeau's face: ""we're going to be here all fucking day""  Edit: I get it, he wore black face, I don't need 600 copies of the same comment, you're not clever or original."

Donald Trump is a fucking idiot  Edit: Thanks for the silver. Let's vote out that waste of a human being.  Edit dos: Gracias for the gold!
He signed with a big black felt marker instead of pen
I think he signed all three signature slots on one of them, instead of signing only one and then also signing one slot on the other two copies.  Edit: I could be wrong. See video from u/The_Last_1_Standing.
Just a guess, but I'd imagine the signature blocks are different for each nation's copy. Maybe each one has their representative's sig first.  Probably wrong though.
I still can't believe he signs shit with a sharpie. It's so pathetic.  He makes Melania do it too. Look up her signature. It's almost exactly like his crayon scrawl.
He was elected to lead not to read   Edited edit:  Edit: wow, i make one simpsons reference and my inbox explodes (exaggeration but I didn't expect to get this many responses to this stupid comment 🤣), thanks For the karma
This one I couldn't watch all the way through. This exact kind of cringe makes me physically uncomfortable.
At least he didn't try to go full Stanley
> Trudeau's face:  This *has* to have been an intentional set-up.
I added the theme song for you and it's pure genius  [Spread Your Enthusiasm for the Dumbass-in-Chief](https://imgur.com/a/TATxdPs)
He signed with a black felt marker ([as you can see in this article](https://www.axios.com/trump-trudeau-usmca-trade-deal-signing-g20-800b8d13-09fd-432d-9b64-e5e24e7cfa8c.html)), but these reactions are from when they realize that he signed in the wrong place in one of the documents, which is why in the article you’ll see only two documents instead of all three.

How did you get to the top with so many upvotes?   No, false, that's not what happened. If you watch the real unedited clip it looks like he may have signed the wrong line.. if that even, Canadian PM didn't show his book at the end so we can't prove it from the clip.  You can see him saying his name as he signs each document.  The clip is only 2min, so there is no reason not to watch it.  Actual clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvMzBQd91Ow  Edit: props to u/braxistExtremist for his edit.
Fuck, that’s a valid point
"This is the only cringe I can tolerate. Like it's Trump. I like to imagine he knew he fucked up **BIG TIME** but tried to play it off as best as he could. All while thinking to himself, *""Jesus fucking Christ Don get it together.""*"
Take that sharpie... And shove it up your butt!!!
Trudea's whiteface:
All 3 of them sign in first box of the first copy they get. You can see how Justin and Pena's signatures are swapped in the copies that are held up (https://i.imgur.com/iS5PtKK.png) and that all 3 start writing on the left (https://youtu.be/TRvM1wjpC48?t=1142).   Either Trump and Trudeau messed up (possible), or the signature boxes aren't in the same order on each (also possible, given you can see the text layout above is different).
"It's weird to answer ""No, false!"" to a comment that starts with ""I think that... "".  They may be wrong with the facts, but what he said was true.  There's really no point in being mad and aggressive here."
>Jesus fucking Christ Don get it together.  No way Trump can even wrap his head around this notion
Are those documents the ones that are filed or are the real ones signed behind the scenes and what we see on tv is just 'for show'?   Also why does Trump use a damn marker? Is it some kind of subconcious ego thing? It is like his name just has to stand out above others.
The man loves sharpies. He once raved in an interview about how much he likes sharpies and how he contacted the company to see if “it comes in all black, can they make it look rich?” And so he got sharpies with his signature on the side in gold.   I looked for the clip but can’t find it unfortunately.  EDIT: https://youtu.be/bDJ799HbzRw skip to 10:57
"trump use Sharpies because he needs reading glasses and he's too vain to wear them. When I didn't want to wear mine, I used a big black sharpie, just like him. The first time I saw a picture of his ""notes"", I knew it. They looked exactly like mine.  I've stopped doing it since I saw that. I wear my fucking glasses like a grown ass adult."
Think of him more like a wrestling personality than a serious politician
When he was in San Diego last week he signed the border wall with a sharpie.... I don’t know why I’m still surprised by his actions at this point.
I still believe in this specific positive effect of Donald Trump in our society. He holds a mirror to our own foolish actions, and challenges us to do better than him.
Someone should make sure to sign after Trump with a gold sparkle marker, being sure to overlap his signature.  Or use a glue pen and dust it with glitter and uncooked macaroni.
What else are you gonna sign a steel slat with?
Personally when I write on steel which is often. I use paint pens.
Don’t be so pessimistic. If he gets re-elected, the nuclear holocaust will wipe us out long before he hits the 8 year mark. Glass half full!

I love the young people table before the first turn with the wink, laughing, and flip of the bird. Very funny and how I remember my friends doing similar actions out in restaurants and other places.
I would be so terrified of losing my GoPro. The balls on the owner.
So the guy who did this actually faced a lot of criticism for it in Japan.   https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/03/16/go-pro-sushi-tkyo-sam/
I've never had sushi ever, or own a GoPro and now I want both.
I loved it. The happiness of people who noticed and the innocence of those in their own world.  On a different level, it makes you think deeply about our social construct and how, despite being on different sides of the world, we’re all human beings with our own thoughts and interests. Our own set of problems and desires. Brought together by social situations and food, it’s like seeing inside through the looking glass of life while being outside of your own for just a moment until you’re brought back to your senses when reality demands it.   Everyone here has now existed in that time and place, though not at the same time, nor were we truly there, but we experienced it just the same thanks to this.   Thank you. It truly made me happy.
This seems like a play or some weird short film showing different stages of life. The friends, the distracted husband with his family, the people on dates, guys just laughing at the one dude in the group who's the funniest. It's amazing.
I dont care. That shit was a cinematic masterpiece. Every table was a glimpse into the lives of total strangers. How and why they are who they are and what they ordered and why they react the way they react. I saw tired families, old couples, young kids, single man wanting sushi. Makes you wonder how all their life decisions led to that moment that is captured by a sushi carousel.
Humans are adorable.
Me too! Couldn't stop watching, just wanted to see the next table and their setup.
Something beautiful about seeing people come together for food.
It was r/oddlysatisfying worthy
That was almost like a short film.  A small look into a very human experience, gathering to eat together.
Watch midnight diner!
My favorite part was that same table the guy in the front knew it was there and didn't even react.  Too cool for school.
Is bird flipping universal? I'm assuming this is japan
If you were to try it, Japan would be a good place to do it
Yep. I knew this kinda reaction would happen. It's such a typical thing that foreigners do when they're in Japan..
The video itself is charming, has a cinematic feel to it. But the reality is that it's a douchebag move. Don't invade other people's privacy or put your bacteria coated GoPro on food conveyor.
Definitely try sushi!
The gray jacket teen guy: gives a middlefinger  Happiness is beautiful indeed
All the ones that noticed seemed to feel like they had to do something for the camera. It was adorable and very funny!
I just hate that in some places, someone would swipe that
Pretty sure so. At least it is now, with media and America’s overall world presence.
But the actual people who were there didn't seem annoyed by it. I am confusion.  Edit: I'm getting replies from both sides of the argument. I'm leaning towards it not being deal. Hopefully he put the Go Pro on a dish. It's not like he went to the Suicide Forest to film dead bodies.
I’m allergic to sushi. Every time I eat more than 80 sushis I barf.  Edit: My first gold! Thank you kind stranger.
Except that guy eating that kept on staring at the camera... I guess he was too indecisive or too caught up with his food
Pretty rare in Japan.   When I was there people would just leave their bikes unlocked out on the street and no one stole anything. Whole different culture.
I was thinking the same thing. In America it'd only get about 3 tables before some one stole it, called the police, or management flipped the fuck out because some one was filming in the restaurant.
Yelled at someone who threw a plastic container of salad out the window the other day. He stepped out and threatened to beat me up. It was a nice time
Yeah, but one guy does it, then loads of other people will think it's a cool idea and do the same. It just gets annoying. The ban is understandable.
It's unsanitary. Even in sushi places in America you're not supposed to put anything back on the belt.
Just stop at 79 then.  Ah what am I saying. That’s impossible.
Or is married and was there with his girlfriend.
Their concerns are perfectly valid as well. You don't know what kind of germs the camera may have and end up in the food conveyor, there are a lot of people out there that dislike being recorded when there's an expecting privacy vs out on the street in a public place and situation.
My brother accidentally left his wallet at a public basketball court and couldn't find it when he went back for it. A few days later it showed up in our mailbox, someone returned it based off his address on his driver's license, but all of his cash was gone lol. He found it funny that the thief went out of his/her way to return his wallet.
It's possible the thief dumped the wallet and somebody else found it and mailed it in.
I agree, this does seem possible.
I remember this scene but no context with it. I mean it's pretty depressing tbh lol
how can they afford such high quality cutlery but not decent food
But why did they cut a cocktail hotdog when in the cartoon it’s a bean.....?
Mickey and the Beanstalk! This was a favorite of mine growing up.
As a college student: I’m in this video and I don’t like it.
Though depressing, it’s one hell of an advert for that knife. I’d buy.
It’s from the jack and the beanstalk one. No idea how I remember that.
You can make a cheap knife really sharp, it just won't keep that edge for long.
A sign that things were once good and then they fell on hard times
Matches the color, easier to cut.
Have you ever cut a bean?
Donald also loses his mind and tries to rage kill their only cow shortly after this meal. It’s probably the most heat Donald has ever gotten in any of their cartoons.  Edit: I get it. He did a stint as a Nazi. Here’s the thing though: a duck with with a political belief system, as seriously *misguided* as they may be, is funny to me. A duck with an axe scares the fuck out of me. It’s as simple as that.
i disregarded my knowledge of this in order to ask a rhetorical question with a humorous undertone
OP IS A PHONY!!!
What about that time he just straight up drowned Goofy?  [https://i.imgur.com/U7hWjlU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/U7hWjlU.jpg)
I find this a little hard to believe after seeing the cartoon of Donald being a Nazi soldier.
That's cold. The absolute lack of remorse fills me with dread.
That's the exact reason I found it absurdly hilarious.  Do Goofy and Donald have a history of hating each other, or was the comic just in a really shitty mood that day? Either way that cracked me up.
Comics back then did shit like that all the time. It wasn't seen as anything serious. Imagine if Tom and Jerry was new today and look at how in those old ones they were just straight up going for murder, plus how many old cartoons joked about suicide. It was all lighthearted and not meant to be read seriously.
Just so you know, that wasn't how the show ended. It wasn't the last episode or anything, just the ending to that particular one.   There was one of those images people share that said that's how they ended the show, but that was all a lie
Also it was because both of them where heartbroken after a love interest rejected each one and went with another. Nothing about guilt or broken man lmao.
This ended up being so much better than I expected, thank you.

The face the guy with the mop makes kills me
Why are all of them so goddamn swole?
This made my whole week. Oh my god hahaha I couldn’t handle the boot and the dog part killed me
She looks like Rihanna?
I found this _exceedingly_ easy to masterbate to. 
Just imagine your minding your own buisness and your hooman just pics you up and starts rubbing you to his shoulder. Weird hooman, but still good hooman
But can anyone tell me why she even did that in the first place? Who watches these things?
Second dude is swole LaVar Burton 
We’re all swole...why aren’t you?
Probably a /fit/ or bodybuilding forums meme tbh
Got to be the dog. Poor thing took it like a champ.
It was such a great comedic build. I was like “what’s more outrageous than using a boot?   ...oh, an animal. Yes ok that is more outrageous”
I honestly lost it at the first one with the toilet brush, and just kept laughing more and more as it progressed
Also /r/dogswithjobs  
Hope you get better soon dude! 
That's his sultry face, to match the original GIF. that face is my favorite. Maybe second favorite after the dog...
I think the last one has to be the best just because of his expression. It looks like someone convinced him to do the scene with no explanation or context and all that’s going through his head is “why am I rubbing the dog on the lotion again?”
If he had used one of those [little bbq basting mops](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1BV2tQFXXXXXHXXXXq6xXFXXXg/New-15-7-40cm-BBQ-Brush-Wooden-Handle-Cotton-Basting-Mop-Long-Barbecue-Sauce-Mop-Basting.jpg_640x640.jpg) I think I would have died. 
Has to be some bros from the gym that decided to collaborate.
Why are all of them so goddamn handsome?
Yes, Rihanna looks like Rihanna.
That is Rihanna.
Not sure if you caught that was Rihanna, marketing a new skin product. It’s essentially a commercial
It’s from Rihanna’s instagram. She’s advertising the latest product from her Fenty line.

The Reading RainBowflex
No... should I be? Is everybody swole except me?
Nobody who frequents /fit/ looks like any of those guys.
Tell me why you can google anything and find an answer on the bodybuilding forums?! It’s absurd. One of the internet’s greatest resources, truly.
r/nocontext ?
Thanks! it’s been a long month.   Got the antibiotics (first round was ineffective) and inhaler today!   Im just thankful it isn’t full on pneumonia, this is known to be a much milder form. 
The dog absolutely killled me. I couldn’t breathe. 
yeah but it looks like her too..

Did you try medicating your shoulder as depicted?
She has a new beauty product line called, *Fenty Beauty*. She’s advertising a new product she’s releasing that’s like a shimmery glow lotion called *Body Lava* you put on for when you go to the beach.  My gal friend tried it and she said it’s sticky and uncomfortable, but Rihanna being hot made her buy it.
Oh I don’t wanna die
From what I've heard from all of my fam and friends, fenty basically is only amazing because of the level of shades they offer for black people. Other than that its a solid 7/10.
Fenty sounds like a nickname people from the UK would give to fentanyl. 
We all die.
Work in the beauty industry. When Fenty launched it completely rocked the industry. The following months they were plagued with awful product reviews. They are still doing great, but it has more to do with Rihanna more than the products she is selling...
It’s her real name. Robyn Fenty. 
We are ALL swole on this blessed day!
The way I see it, Fenty dies in about 2-5 years IF the rest of the industry decides to finally offer more shades of dark.
I mean it is madness and a massive part of why fenty has almost completely stolen the black market.
What a harmless prank! This is the stuff I like to see.
The Asian guy's delayed reaction is the best.
That last one ... *ooh whatcha sayyyy*
I don’t think that Asian woman was doing it right. 
I think they all need somebody to lean on
The key to great high fives is to look at the elbow of the person you're high-fiving.
That last one😂😂  *Hello darkness my old friend*
Tourists like to pretend that they are holding the structure in the background up, when in reality it’s just an illusion. 
I got to visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa a year or so ago, and was so excited, the only problem was the one day that we actually had time in our busy schedules to go check it out, there was a torrential downpour.  My girlfriend thought it would be a good idea to throw on our ponchos anyway and venture out in the rain.  Little did she know the lawn gnome was made of metal, and tasted like kudzu.  I sneezed so hard all the fish fled, and I was left holding my breath until my Mom got dressed.
the leaning tower is the lil wayne of architecture 
*only 7 photos were harmed in the making of this film*
I liked the part where the Asian guy doubled back for a legitimate high five. That's a good sense of humor right there.
He’s an Aussie YouTuber, him and his mate are constantly on the news here for pissing people off. I think they are harmless, but let’s just say this is probably the only wholesome prank they have done.
Once he realized what was going on he was so hyped though lol 
mmm that you only meant wellllllll

Yeah, I was going to say this is probably the only prank he has done that can be considered harmless.
Having genuine human interaction with strangers while being a tourist are the highlights of the trip, in my experience.
I strive to be as cool as that guy seemed.

Having a photo of a stranger high-fiving you in front of Pisa is honestly much more memorable than your copy of the now generic hand-lifting pose.
And, of course, you *DID* want weed
I was traveling abroad with a friend recently, and I guess he fit the stereotype of european drug dealer? So many random people asking for weed. Also he got randomly searched by the police. He's Canadian.

And you know she’s calling out for them. Why is it that when you start calling your child’s name in panic, they turn mute all of a sudden?
Ahhhh r/giftsthatendtosoon
Omg scared the shit out of me emphasizing with them! Yikes! Speedy kid ftw!
Absolutely. Wish I could see the look on her face when she sees the little one. That would have been so relieving, even for me watching it.
"I know the fear.  My kid has ADHD. His pediatrician and I started discussing behavioral modification techniques to utilize with him at the age of *ONE*. By age two, he could jog a full three miles with my mother at her slower 10k pace. He was like a little motor that wouldn't stop.  One day when he was two, we were at the park, and after a few hours of running around like a maniac at the playground, it was time to go home. He, possessing boundless energy, didn't want to leave and hid behind a giant ""island"" of bushes.  I counted to three and went to get him behind the bushes, but he wasn't there. I ran around the bushes a few times and couldn't find him. The only place he could have gone was up this tiny hill.  I ran as fast as I could up the hill, but the grass along the sides of the path was at least three feet tall, and he was shorter than that. To top it off, I'm really short and couldn't see very far. I ran into several groups of people coming down the path and I'd ask if they had seen my son and they'd say, ""Oh, we wondered why he was alone!!!""  It took me almost a mile to catch up to him. I was gasping for my last breaths on this Earth, and he didn't even have the good sense to be winded. The terror was *real*."
Oh man, as 6 year old, I gave my mom a panic attack.   tl;dr - walked away from my mom at a mall, walked several blocks, hung out at the Y-M-C-A.   We were at the downtown “mall” in my small at the time hometown. She gave me a coin to toss in the fountain. She said she was going to go in the store right there, 20 yards from the fountain. I didn’t hear that part obviously.   So I get done with my wish and turn around...she’s not there. Do I panic? Nope. I immediately recall that my sisters are at the YMCA for a sports camp thing, hence why we are downtown. I walk the 3 blocks or so, not far really, but feels far for a 6 year old.   I hang out on the steps outside. Not sure why I didn’t go in? It was a nice day i guess...I found a quarter on the ground so I was having a blast with that.   Unbeknownst to me, panic is ensuing at the mall. This was right around the time that AMBER alert was just created so I don’t know if they put one out or not. But police were involved, mall on lockdown, people going from store to store. Again, it’s not a very big mall. Two stories but maybe only like 12 stores at the time?   Then at some point a woman came out of the YMCA and asked me if I was NAME. I said yes and she said my mom was in the phone for me so I followed her inside to the front desk. Didn’t really understand why my mom was crying on the phone (lol silly mom I thought). So I hung out with the nice front desk lady. Had a snack and waited for my mom to walk over and my sisters to get done.   I don’t remember the aftermath really, just the situation of what happened, but to 6 year old me I didn’t see the big deal. This was before cell phones anyway so times were just different... I mean I know abductions happened but I was 6 ya know?   So yeah, I get why lady in video was freaking out.
Yeah for real, I actually wish the video captured her hugging and cuddling the little chap. Poor woman! So glad she found the cute buffoon quickly.
"I was 6 or 7 at the time when my mom and I were out at the walmart we always shop at. As we went  down the aisles, we got to an item on the list that I remembered seeing a couple of aisles back. Been too long so I don't remember what it was. So I told her I would go get it and please don't leave the aisle. (My mom had a tendancy to wander around and didn't like staying in the same spot.)  After securing her promise, I raced to the aisle, snatched up the item, and zoomed back immediately to find mom gone. I went to the next aisle that she would have gone to in our normal pattern and she wasnt there either. I went to the next one, and then the next. Still no mom.  I backtracked. Still no mom. I ran all the way down to the far end looking down each aisle as i passed. Nothing. Ran all the way back, doing the same thing. Mom disappeared. So what do I do?  Went straight to the cash registers and told them how mom got lost and I can't find her. The cashier was sweet, and asked for mom's name. I gave it and the woman picked up the phone and announced over the intercom, ""[Mom's name] please come to the registers. Your daughter is looking for you.""  Mom showed up very soon afterwards and the adults were all laughing as I scolded her for leaving the aisle when I told her I was coming right back. Mom had a sheepish grin on her face the whole time."

It’s a promo for a Facebook series called 5 points. Source: I worked one of their promos as a background actor. Also here’s the link https://instagram.com/p/Be8vrJAH-8D/ Edit: Fun Fact: when working on one of their other promos like these, the title/project name was called “viral video” on my voucher (prof of work) seems like It did go viral, interesting.
But it´s real, my father was the skateboard
"They are Chaotic Good. Think Mal from Firefly, Robin Hood, the Blues Brothers. No regard for Rule of Law, but also aren't going to stand by while someone's life is threatened. They probably justify the petty theft as a ""victimless crime,"" whether it is or not.   Edit: also, a (chaotic) neutral person would probably not get involved."
Yeah or Chaotic Neutral.    Lawful = wouldn't be robbing a store in the first place    Evil = wouldn't care about stopping the gunman
What a tide* (ad)
"Checking security footage the shop owner must have muttered ""motherfuckers""  But its probably fake. "
It’s from the movie From Justin To Kelly. 
It's probably more like 3 pounds with all that air in the bags.
I agree, however the events in this video seemed extremely staged, how as the robber fell the gun was placed on the counter so perfectly, and the impact the 15lb stand of chips had   Edit: just rewatched, the tackle was very light and for someone to take their eyes off of a guy they have at gun point to look at skateboard for that long isn't real, there's no way
Over chips....
A chaotic neutral person would get involved if they benefited from doing so.
I thought Lawful meant they have a proper set of rules that they follow, while Chaotic means they do whatever they want, whenever they want.  Otherwise Lawful Evil doesn't really make much sense.
Something tells me you are really fun at parties. 
It's apparently a promo for some show called five points  https://www.instagram.com/p/Be8vrJAH-8D/
No one has watched this so we can't call you on it.
Honestly I'm surprised those chip stands don't just float away!
3 pounds of air sounds heavy
Ya that's bad. 
He's agreeing that this particular gif was staged. He's saying however, that a similar even has probably actually happened at some point in history.
Plot twist: they’re all tide ads.
In this case, they benefited from running away from the store with the loot.  Definitely Chaotic Neutral.  Closer to Chaotic behavior because they are okay with shoplifting. But definitely not Evil because they don't threaten/harm the storeowner with anything, and as a matter of fact helped him, but took advantage of the situation by running away with the loot.
I think lawful evil is when you do all the evil things, but entirely within the law. Think every government ever.
If you're a billionaire landlord who pays his lawyers to fuck over his poor tenants using legal loopholes in the law. Making sure to follow every rule and every law 100% correctly, but not giving two shits about what other people have to suffer from it.  Or if you're a bitter old lady who tells the kids to get off the lawn because the sign says no playing on the lawn.  Lawful just means you play by the rules. You can still be an asshole.
That's why you never see three musketeers by them selfs
[3 pounds of steel is heavier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH0hikcwjIA)
Nah man, definitely chaotic good. They didn't need to help the owner out to get away with the loot, they could have sneakily waited in the back and then rushed out after the gunman got the cash from the register and fled. By taking out the gunman, they put themselves in danger to assist another person. That shit is straight up good.  In fact had they actually been chaotic neutral they would have not helped the owner and simply taken the distraction as an opportunity to load up on more stolen goods while they sneakily waited and avoided the confrontation.
"Entirely within ***a*** law.  ""Lawful"" just means they follow a code, not that said code is legit or socially accepted.  [Edit:  It's worth noting that older versions of AD&D did lean toward the more honorable sense of law.  More broadly, I think it's mostly about how the character values rules.  Lawful characters believe that rules are necessary and an honorable pursuit.  They follow an objective mandate.  Chaotic characters value self-determination and subjective judgements, so they follow an internal, more fluid directive.  A lawful evil character could be a politician twisting the Common Law to his own ends, or an ancient demon who unquestioningly seeks to fulfill a prophecy.]"

Good to see Bill Burr trying out other careers!
I wish I had him as a teacher in school. The fact that he immediately apologized for unintentionally embarrassing her was nice to see. All my teachers seemed to enjoy embarrassing me on purpose quite unapologetically.
r/whyweretheyfilmiohhhhhhhh
WELL PLAYED!   **This** is how you win April Fools. 
My high school American history teacher, lets call him Mr. France, had a no cell phone policy in his class (obviously) and there was a girl, let's call her Ashley, whose phone always seemed to ring in his class. Mr France was an older guy but honesty one of the best teachers who really connected with most of the kids. So one day Mr. France set up a friend of Ashley's to call during his class. As her phone rang he stood up, walked over and took the phone, walked back to his desk and smashed it on the desk over and over pieces flying everywhere. He then resumed his lesson as if nothing had happened, the class in shock. As the bell rang he called over Ashley and gave her her phone back saying he never wanted to hear it in class again. The old bastard had switched out her phone and smashed an old one instead. I remember it working, I don't recall her phone ringing again. I miss Mr. France. 
Idk why but i can tell hes probably a good teacher.  I think its because when one cares less about ones ego, they have room to care about other things, like the subject of the class one is teaching.   One.
This should be higher. The audio really pulls it all together.
To be honest I did not expect that to have that many views. With how popular this is I wonder how it flew under my radar. 
The face of a man who *didn’t* just lose his job
That’s one hell of a way to find out you’re a father

This looks like a really good teacher 
The best part was that Schmoyoho wrote that comment.
I was prepped for anger but died in laughter
This is the best harmless prank I've ever seen, not some bs where someone just goes out and assaults some random person then flips out when they start chasing them.
He probably didn't trust himself not to give it away so he just planted in face down in his arms.
That’s depressing isn’t it
Except for the baby, who the fuck wants to be named April Fools Nefcy?!
> unintentionally embarrassing her  That *was* his intention. That's the whole point of making them answer it on speaker. He just didn't know it would be about something so personal.
Except I think the gif was better without the opening explanation that it was a prank... 
Top of videos 4 years ago, so itd be hard to end up seeing it trending again 
That would definitely not be something you want to come up in your tenure review.
"The paper going up was perfect.  *""OH NO""*"
The way he takes it after the prank is revealed speaks loud and clear what kind of person he is. An awesome one. Also the immediate apology was a great show of character.
>Except for the baby, who the fuck wants to be named April Fools Nefcy?!    The poor kid whose parents named him Hitler?  ;)

Buttons on her skirt if I recall correctly. It was a laugh cuz we all knew what could have happened but it was also a relief that Chaplin knew how to do comedy
Yeah OSHA tried to do their own version of this skit and it wasn't nearly as funny.
> CGI  Chaplin's Goddamn Impressive
Easy there, Robert Kraft.
He did it to the guy instead, so there wasn't a point to also do it on her for the cheap expected laugh. He really was a genius.
The one thing I will remember about high school are the psa’s we had to watch. I swear they don’t care how many people they scar in order to get their point across.  Edit: Never saw the OSHA one but I can assume what it’s like.
Also breaking expectations is a big part of comedy; him doing it to the man sets it up for doing it to the woman.  Him going for something else breaks that expectation and is funnier.  Also let's be real, in the 30's they might have clutched their pearls over anything to do with breasts.
I wasn't sold until the 9 separate phones in sync with each other. What skill.   Edit: Apparently a lot of people agree with me but a few say this is easily done with an app. Interesting. I challenge these people to recreate this easily with an app and show me how easy it is.

Amateur editor here. Depending on your skills and preparation, this can go from annoyingly long to painstakingly long. It's only one minute though, so if the shots are clean this can be done in 3-4 hours (not including filming time). I could make this in one afternoon I guess. None of this is particularly difficult to make, but it's annoying and long and requires a special kind of dedication. Kinda like walking 100 miles. Pretty much anyone could do it, but very few actually will.  Edit: I bet a really talented pro could do it in about one hour. 
Nice try you Australian cunt, you ain't getting a supply of cheap labor from us!
Mine are too drenched to fly. They'd just fall out of the sky onto a moving car or something

Yeah, you can really tell this dude loves the way he looks. Reminds me of pretty much every cringy musical.ly video.
In his defense his hair is pretty spectacular. 
Bitch lasagnas love his vids
Wait a minute..
I don’t agree with this. Much longer and nobody could do it in an hour unless they had every single motion effect already saved as a preset and a very very detailed plan (which would take its own amount of time). This is assuming they’re only using premier and not waiting for after effects to do stuff. At MINIMUM I’d give a pro 5 minutes per effect/cut so if there’s 100 then a little over 8 hours. And some of those scenes are pretty complicated like the 3x3 dark iPhones. You basically have to look e up timing on 9 videos at once which is tedious.   Source: I edit videos for a living. 
Better check my wiper blades
Their second album, where Here it Goes Again came from, was a great alternative rock album. They put effort into their songs and videos. Now you can tell they are just having fun - making over the top videos and okay songs... Nothing spectacular. Maybe they are having fun with the sings, but they really aren't anything to write home about. 
I'm Indian and I can confirm this.
"Am I a bad person for hating selfies with generic ""positive"" messages like this: ""Dare to believe that you are strong and you're special because one day you might change the whole world. And that one day your painful past would become a history to be told with pride. Wink*""  Nice editing though."
Yeah guys got some sick flow. Jealous.
Videographer here, I disagree with your disagreement (partially). The planning and preparation stage would take quite a bit of time, but the editing itself could definitely be done in the ballpark of an afternoon (certainly not an hour though), given most of these are just fairly basic whip and zoom transitions already done in camera. The phone part is of course the most complicated/time-consuming, but really it's just 3 shots mirrored + 1 center shot composited together in after effects; assuming enough frame rate when shot, you can just adjust the speed/timing of each tile to match each other live, which is not really all that tedious, especially when you get such a cool result out of it.
No, you're a bad person for other reasons that you'd never reveal to strangers on the internet. But not for this my friend!
No video editing experience here, but I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out... and I've got a front row seat.
It's that app that makes videos where you sing along to stuff and act retarded, you must have seen it online.
"the historical inaccuracy here is infuriating. some zombies are in old west motif and others are dressed like its roman times.  the bible clearly states jesus beat the zombies at our about 686AD in the Philippines.  i mean i get it, writers need to take some liberties with the facts to tell a good story but this is a ""Braveheart"" level romantasization of facts."
This did not disappoint.  It's like watching Thor, but it's Jesus with a fish instead of Mjolnir.
Wait!  Why is a guy who came back from the dead (you know... a zombie!) fighting fellow zombies!?
This is made by the Eric Balfour, who gave Eric Andre maybe his funniest interview (it's my favorite, at least): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ3P0YjFEJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ3P0YjFEJU)
We also know that Jesus ended up being bitten, which has been misinterpreted for a long time about his resurrection from the dead.
As a Scandinavian I wholeheartedly support this analogy.
It's explained in the [full movie](https://youtu.be/GuKV2Z3eYTY). >!Jesus says that He got it wrong with Lazarus, but later he is able to raise Judas correctly so one can assume that He will be able to raise himself correctly (i.e. not as a zombie) as well. Regardless, the movie takes place before the resurrection.!<  Edit: Fixed link to the original video.
“The Fist Of Jesus” on youtube
"Zombies can't walk on water though.  Shamans, however, have both Water Walking and Reincarnation.  Or for the non-WoW players he was a Lich.  But Jesus was certainly no *mere* zombie.  Edit: Fuck I just realized that Jesus had the Mage ability ""Conjure Bread""  Did Jesus cheat and Multiclass?"
He was a shaman *before* he was raised as a zombie. Read the bloody bible next time you want to make a fool out of yourself.
How awesome! Thanks for sharing!
One of my favorite post of all time. Thanks man, you make it look worth the effort
Real maple syrup is so good. If you haven't had anything but the equivalent of like aunt jemima's I highly reccomend you try some of the good shit!
imagine if you could tap beer trees like that, 
Watch out for the maple syrup mafia
"This is one of those things I've always wondered how ""we"" as a species figured out how to do in the first place. Having never tried unfiltered/unprocessed sap, I'm not sure if the taste of the sap alone got people thinking it could be used for food, but how did they then think to boil it down and filter it?  (Pardon the run on sentence and overall shit grammar.)  I realize this wasn't an overnight process, but when you think of all the steps and work that goes from sap to syrup, it's kinda interesting how innovative ""we"" can be. Just consider how many of the things we take for granted now that started out so differently and then changed and improved with time and technology.  https://youtu.be/YRL4uIVzVWI"
This is one of those times where my whole life I just assumed it was much simpler and then when I see how it really is I’m like “ok yeah I’m dumb.” TIL maple syrup doesn’t come directly out of the tap.
Next year try taking 1cup of roasted whole coffee beans and putting them into one of the jars of hot syrup before you seal it. The coffee infused syrup is great on pancakes but its fantastic over vanilla ice cream.
Serious question. Are we just bleeding trees for their delicious syrupy blood?
The key to getting sap to flow is that you need above freezing temps during the day and below freezing temps at night. As long as the cycle goes on, the sap will flow. 
LPT For anyone actually planning to try this!  A friend of mine whose family owns a sugar bush once told me a little trade secret: Tapping the south facing side of the tree will result in more sap being collected.  The sun shining on the south face causes the tree trunk to warm and the sap to flow more freely.
This reminded me of the Dirty Money episode about the Quebec Maple syrup cartel. I wonder if they control walnut syrup too. 
What are you talking about? Dude is a tree thief! Poor trees. Just trying to collect their own energy and he comes along and drills a hole and steals from them.  MAPLE SYRUP IS MURDER!
Then this is my favorite comment of all time. Thank you for appreciating it!
I think gold is cheaper than real maple syrup here.
I feel like I'm the odd one out for preferring the 'shitty' corn syrup butter flavored kind. I've tried all kinds of real maple syrup and I just enjoy what I grew up with- the cheap stuff.
Stop! I can only get so hard! 
*Quebec intensifies*
I can’t say I’d have been the guy to have noticed it, but my maples sometimes just “leak” all on their own. If a crack forms for whatever reason, you’ll see a big obvious wet spot where the sap has run down the side of the tree. On warmer days, you’ll see ants and other bugs just swarm the area. So if I had to venture a guess, one of our great great (great) grandparents took that as a clue that there’s something tasty there.  *Food* for thought! 
I’ve still got 2-3 weeks more to go! Sounds interesting. What’s it like?
Yep. You can tap trees once they’re larger than 12 inch diameter without stressing them. iirc 12-18” you can tap once, 18-24” twice, and larger than 24” you can tap 3 times. 
Maple, walnut, box elder, sycamore and birch! I’ve only done the first two. Maple makes SO much more sap than walnut, and the sap that it makes has higher sugar content.
Things get wet?
Unless you live in the Southern Hemisphere 
This person is poaching syrup if they are not paying into the quebec reserve system. 
I'll assume your kidding so that my blood pressure doesn't go thru the roof for no reason
I’m Canadian and had no idea the sap would be completely clear. Wtf?
I don't know you, and I'm a little buzzed tonight, but your gif made me so so very happy!  Taking that simple tree juice and, not only making yummy pancake sauce but showing us how you've done it and making it seem so easy, too!  ...   I love that I'm thinking about you and your awesome male syrup.   Is walnut syrup as tasty as I think it would be?  Or is it more bitter?   You're lovely.  Cheers.   Edit:  MAPLE syrup.  Thanks for being so helpful, autocorrect.
$10-12 CDN per litre (about a quart). Well worth it
I'll ship you a litre. My neighbor taps his trees and I help him make it. Pm me your address
*cries in Quebecois*
Aren't you the guy who couldn't open those soylent bottles?
I honestly don't know. Do maple trees grow naturally in the southern hemisphere?
If this blows your mind, you should definitely visit a sugar bush and take their tours!
It’s amazing and you’re amazing and I hope you get the chance to try it sometime. It’s pretty awesome to be able to make random strangers somewhere in the world happy just by sharing a little bit of my life. Thanks for checking in, and enjoy that buzz!
> I love that I'm thinking about you and your awesome male syrup.  
When you consider the prices some people pay in the us ... Thats a steal.

Hello! 
A year, sap only flows for a few weeks in the spring each year 
Life always finds a way. 
The 100% maple syrup from Costco is only like $12 / litre in the US. Trader Joe's is around that, too.
I'll cover it. You need to try Maple syrup
It’s a good thing in that it equalizes profits, yes, but it’s a bad thing in that they are absurdly aggressive to those who don’t want to join them. The organization was undoubtedly founded with great intentions, but their current state is akin to a predatory HOA here in the states
I posted on /r/soylent about it and it went viral—got on some popular YouTube channel and everything. Lots of folks were following me around Reddit for a few days to share their concerns about my strength (in their own creative ways of course) 😂 Reddit’s a heck of a place
...you mean like milk? 
Not bitter. Extremely sweet. I use it as a natural sweetener in coffee, baking and on ice cream. We use it in pretty much everything as a replacement to Brown sugar or artificial sweeteners. It's cool making your own sugar from a tree that grows in your yard.

Oh, you thought that was a baby and don’t check what sub you’re on. This is footage of an as yet undocumented SCP phenomenon, the GiggleGobble. Once you make eye contact with it  the creature forces you to laugh, sucking the joy out of you and into their gaping maw.

This brings me joy every time I see it. I hope he ended up working with animals. 
His reactions are so adorable. A genuine interest in something new to him. 
So everyone can just have their phone out in school now? I couldn't even wear a hat. 
My son once asked me if bears were real. I laughed at first but realized in the age of cgi it would be hard for a kid to know what beasts are real, especially if he didnt grow up on David Attenborough like myself. I can imagine this kid not watching nature shows much and can't believe what he is seeing.
That one moment in time that makes you know the path you want to go down. Kid will be running the City Zoo in 20 years.
His joy actually outweighs the annoyance I feel watching the idiot in the back that can’t be bothered to look up from her phone. To be fair, she wasn’t during the first two...
This is a Florida high school.  What kind of duck is that?   Edit: this is a Louisiana high school.  Double Edit: this is an Illinois high school.  I was wondering why you all kept messaging me even after my first edit. I didn't realize my mistake.

This is my old High School. There is a zoo right next to it! He should just go in for a job with this video as his resume. I’d hire him on the spot. 
Oldie, but a goodie. Have an upvote.
Seeing a student that legitimately interested makes me quite happy :D
I was thinking this the whole time. Get that boy a job at a zoo or a vet.
I was thinking the same.  Such intense interest.  It makes me happy to see someone realize just how amazing animals are.  There is a wildlife conservancy near my house that I frequent.  They do an adults only night where you can eat, drink, and pet wild animals.  This was me the day I got to pet a sloth.    
I just feel a sense of rage at that one girl ignoring it all on her phone.
how do i feel this
They still can't wear hats
I assume for the animal presentations the teacher may have made an exception
Blue Planet 2 is awesome, especially in HD. Your son might enjoy that
And all the animals there will be better off for having him, judging by his apparent interest.
A muscovy. They're exotic and all over the place in South Florida.
Naw, someone should pay him to travel the world followed by a tv crew just recording his encounters with wild animals. The animal version of Karl Pilkington.
I wish there was money working with animals. I would quit my law job tmr if I knew I wouldnt lose everything. One day when im financially free ill get there.  Edit: I have a family to support you crazy bastards im not driving around in Lambos. 
Go outside
Unlike phones, hats are too distracting  /s
Planet Earth I and II are breathtaking.  
This gif *is* a series of snapchats
Buddy I went to law school with never even practiced, he trains service animals and makes a great living.  Doesn't have to work the shit hours I work either.
How do I get there?
It's alright. Let it all out grandpa. 
Might be different in different fields, but due to limited positions and many passionate workers- animal care jobs do sometimes tend to take advantage of their workers. My friend used to brag that she had to go to school for four years to be able to shovel shit, and nobody is gonna make her feel bad about doing it. 
My vet has an all cat hospital and works 6 days a week and stays late every day. He’s a special person who tries to stay healthy because he’s worried about what all of his patients/their owners would do without him. He might make respectable money but that is his entire life.
Nah, stuff is pretty sweet.
To an extent. Sometimes that stuff isn’t video games, a nice house, a nice car, vacations and eating out. Sometimes that stuff is college for your kids, supporting your kids and spouse’s pursuits, car repairs, house repairs, or paying off debt. Makes it a lot harder to take large financial risks.

I always think this too. Like sure it's impressive and clearly its had a lot of time and effort put into it. But, why do it?
The euphoric feeling of success is quite fleeting.  The anticipation of that feeling, however, can be drawn out nearly indefinitely.  I've been riding the high of almost finishing my novel for like a decade now.
Hey guys I found GRRM

WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
I had a boss tell me she genuinely didn’t trust me because I didn’t have Facebook.  In a jovial yet completely serious manner she proceeded to tell me I must have lots of skeletons in my closet if I’m not a social media person. I protested that I’m not necessarily opposed to it as a concept, and I do admit I have a travel photography Instagram (that’s not connected to my identity) but otherwise it’s just not for me. So yeah... told her I didn’t have Facebook. She told me I was a “closet sociopath”. Seemed like a radical interpretation of the text to me. 
Mmm, what about having a facebook for 9 years and having uploaded only 1 picture?
Where is this from?
the photo album scene killed me
Just link the fucking original video you fuckwad
Black Mirror season 4, can't wait!!!
This is me now. No FB no IG no SC. Fuck I’m so much happier for it as I go thru life.   Edit: please keep in mind folks I’m not judging anyone here. Just relaying my personal experience. Social media is really useful for a lot of things. 
He is me and I'm happier for it.
Is this actually a thing? I've never had a Facebook, Twitter, IG or anything else (nothing to hide, I just don't feel like putting my life on display). I'm married to the same woman for 20 years so I don't know what the modern dating scene is like - is this actually a deal breaker these days?  &nbsp;  edit: Thanks for all of the different perspectives.  I find it sad and a bit scary that this is where we are as a society; but I'm glad to hear that the video is mostly sensationalized.  By not participating in social media, I guess I've been blind to how much of an integral part of some peoples' lives it has become.  I think Knife Party pretty much hit it on the head with [this video.](https://youtu.be/fPslvBVqJp8)
For the love of god, someone needs to do it:   https://youtu.be/GEWnXmDfVZg
"Funny, but sadly true. People have ""jokingly"" asked if I'm a serial killer just cuz I don't have FB. I can remember a time when the internet was still relatively new and people assumed everyone ON the internet was a serial killer. Now it's reversed, what happened? o_O"

I love that he’s still using an old style mobile.  Of course it didn’t break when she slapped it out of his hand.

Costanza
THERE ARE RULES!
Wait so people put their closet-skeletons on Facebook? I keep mine in the closet where I thought they were supposed to be along with my sociopathic nature. Buy what do I know, I’m not on fb either. 
wtf! There are billions of people that are not on Facebook...
"""Why aren't you on social media? Do you have something to hide?""  ""Why do you broadcast the highlights of your life? Do you have something to compensate for?"""
"How does one become a closet sociopath anyway?    *""I don't actually have the full faculty for empathy, but I have figured out how to communicate and successfully model their internal affect with sinister precision.  I then proceed to mimic the tribe sufficient to stay around the other rage monkeys with them taking as little notice of me as possible.  It's a living.  Truthfully, they creep me out a little, especially when they 'express themselves' on casual dress friday.""*"
> I do admit I have a travel photography Instagram (that’s not connected to my identity)   It is now. Thanks for confirming that you do have one, now we just need to match some metadata, login locations, aaaand now it's connected to your identity.
Are you bot?
I haven't found anyone that said it's a dealbreaker, but i think it makes people suspicious. I don't have anything to hide, but i like my privacy.
"The balance I've found to work well is that I have Facebook, but I just never use it. I mean, I'm there. I'm just boring with no posts or anything.  It's the difference between ""see, the box is empty"" and ""there is no box""..."
"Hah, that'd be a deal breaker for me.    "" You need facebook or Snapchat or we can't go out.""    Ok, see ya"
A girl I really liked in high school went away and never had a Facebook. I sometimes question if she was ever real at all.
[Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEWnXmDfVZg&feature=youtu.be) definitely better with sound!
where are the comments? how can he tell if anyone likes them!!!
"I like how the subtitles make the person shaking the girl calmly say  ""Clearly he is catfishing you."" "
Nobody clicks videos anymore.
That's actually a great idea, everyone can be tracked and has a history but then a girl falls in love with a guy that she met outside. She tries to scan him but nothing shows up. So she thinks it's just a bug or something is wrong, and instead of waiting that it's fixed she walks to the guy and talks to him. They click and she gives him her number. They meet again for a date and then she finds out he is off the grid. Then dating becomes extremely hard for her and nobody can help her, not her friends or family. They can't use technology to assist her, she doesn't know how to communicate or organize things with him. She is lost because she develops feelings but has no idea how to show him, because she is not sure how to approach him even after seeing him many times. She is used to finding lots of info about the guys she dates via her tech tools but this time she has nothing to work with. Cool!
Now you have more time for Reddit
You're on Reddit   EDIT: Fair points all. A lack of anonymity is not inherent when using the Reddit.
"Once again, another perfect example of, ""Hey, this is an entire comedy video with music and dialogue. You know what I should really do? Caption it and turn it into a gif.""  Even more egregious, posting it to a subreddit that is about longer gifs that get better and better. It's not long because it gets better. It's long because it's someone's entire youtube video."
The serial killers on the internet convinced everyone that if you're not on the internet, you're serial killer.
I made a Facebook many years ago but never logged in since then. No ig, snapchat or Twitter.  My only social media is reddit and nobody knows I'm a dog on here. 
Can’t stand ya.
That's from Seinfeld 
No no, on Facebook you prove how great of a person you are by sharing things that aren't the skeletons in your closet.
"""billions of closet sociopaths still not using facebook""  - Mark Zuckerberg"
"public boolean isBot(String user){ return !user.equals(""ASK_IF_IM_BOT""); }"
"""stupid Facebook game""  Has 8 accounts.   You are beyond addicted. Just admit you love it. "
I've heard guys who say to girls they date that they're not on social media because they actually have a girlfriend who is all over their social medias, so there's that suspicion there.
"I stopped using Facebook when they started the ""on this day"" business. When you're older it's almost a daily reminder that people you care about have died.   There's a time and a place for that... and it's never when I wanted to check Facebook. "
Somehow it was obvious early on that this was British when I was watching the gif, but I have no idea why.
Haha I too watched the gif, good times 
I don't count this place as social media tho. Maybe that outlook is wrong but it feels different.
Are you serious? She broke up with you over that?!  I’m not on anything but LinkedIn and only because I felt pressured to sign up when I was looking for a new job.  I like when men don’t have social media.  I’m a private person and it makes me feel he’s private and not all about what others think.  Good for you.
Other people TAG your skeletons, that's the brilliance of  facebook 'friendship'. 
This could be a great Onion article.
Yeah, no shit Sherlock. You didn't answer his question. Are you a bot???
"A lot of guys don't have social media because their girlfriends would obsess over every single thing they do online (as shown in this gif. It's funny because it's true). I know I don't like using it anymore because of my ex. If a girl I've never seen and never followed liked my status or tweet, my girlfriend would get emotional. And god forbid I Snapchat my friend more than my girlfriend. Thanks Snapchat for telling everyone btw.  One time a robot messaged me on Xbox and my ex got angry because I didn't tell the bot ""I have a girlfriend."" Not responding wasn't enough for her. Somehow my Xbox was linked to her Windows 10 computer and she could see all of my messages? Which brings me to another point. Fuck the cloud. I can't delete my dick pics fast enough yet they're always appearing in some random ass folder in Google Drive, Dropbox, an attachment in an email I haven't used in 3 years. I don't even take that many dick pics!  Yeah I know not all girls are like this. And not all guys don't have social media. For the ones who aren't very active online though, I'd bet this is pretty relatable. I haven't used social media since that relationship. Even opening the app makes me uncomfortable because you don't know who's name is going to appear to piss off your crazy girlfriend.  Plus I have to choose between updating my relationship status on Facebook for everyone and my mom to see, or not updating it and having my new girlfriend upset that I'm ""hiding her"" while the relationship is a month old.  I don't want a relationship so I can brag about it online. I want a relationship because I actually like the girl. But all it ever seems to be about these days is showing off for everyone else instead of taking care of yourselves."
I like to think of Reddit as antisocial media
True. I can't think of a single reason to date someone other than their value as an accessory.
"That woman has a very British face.   I don't know what that means, but the first thing I thought when I saw her was ""British"".   It's the way she..does her cheekbones..or something.."
I had no idea until the Teresa May tweet so good eye mate. 
I actually agree with this. I have FB and Snapchat, but that's for the fiancee's sake.  Reddit is more like, well, what it is. A feed full of links to things I care about, typically full of information (i.e. memes). It's not necessarily about being social; I can enjoy it without posting if I so wanted. 
He is a bot but it may not help him to say so at this time so he's distracting you with nonsense.  It's called a Boring Test. 
I don't use it, because I don't give two shits about the mundane details of other people's life. Social media is mostly a waste of time
"""It's the way she does her cheekbones"" LOL"
I could only tell when the tweet was to @TeresaMay
I thought it was British when she ran out of the house onto a stereotypical British Street
It’s not nonsense, it’s a function that returns false. The answer is no he is not a bot
It's also terrible for your mental health. I know people get tired of hearing this, but I am honestly happier off of it. There have been numerous studies showing you become more depressed when looking at your timeline (or whatever your app's homepage is). And get more dopamine when looking at your own profile.
I never thought I would ever hear this sentence in my life.
Pick him up, man. Please.

Right? This is like, the one time you can snuggle a bear cub without its mamma tearing your face off.  You snuggle that fuzzy little bastard and you don't put him down!
"I visited with a wildlife rehabber who was serving as intermediary between the owner of a bear cub and a rehab place.   So I go over and start playing with the bear and snuggling with the bear and the guy says to me, dry as a bone ""we want him to be afraid of people...""  Little fucker had some sharp ass claws though."

He'll grow up around human kids, think he's one of them but always be aware there's something a little different. Gets in a lot of fights but learns early on it's better to lose than to face the consequences of winning. He's a shy boy, keeps to himself, and he grows to be a shy man, just trying to get by. Until one day he hears about a forest fire, roaring towards the cabin where Mary-Beth has gone to stay for the summer. He puts on his ranger hat and heads west, towards the flames.
I always wanted an origin story for Smokey
At first I thought it was Pooh's origin story but then it got crazy good  I need more.
No Pooh is from China.
You mean China,the one killing protesters and implementing obligatory face scan to use internet? Led by the dictator Xi Pooh?
I believe that's the one. Loves honey and infringing on civil liberties?
Are we seriously just going to sit back and let wild excavators keep stealing our bridges? I don’t care if they’re endangered, this shit needs to stop!  Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver!
"ITT: ""Definitely not in [wherever you live]"""
it's like watching one of those videos of deepsea creatures eating a whale corpse
In the UK that's a two week job with multiple diversions and tailbacks as far as the eye can see.
I’ve known some people that burn bridges faster than this.
Meanwhile in NY I'm beginning to think traffic cones are the state flower, and the highway on my commute  has been diverted for traffic for over 2 years. Genuinely looks like no progress has been made
Definitely not Illinois
Fought one once, but a random blackcat came out of nowhere and backed it up. They're not alone, man. They're organizing.  Edit: for people who don't know, Black Cat is a construction company.  Edit 2: fixed my stupid typo.
Omg I live there and this is definitely true can confirm.
Actually, I did live there, right under that bridge. Slept through the whole thing.
Where I live, they are going to take 5 years to fix a single on ramp...  I have to take a 20 minute detour to work for five fucking years...
I thought the exact same thing. Like a horde of crabs picking off bits of a whale's decaying body.
2 weeks .... yea on the planning board, but then they would discover a greater crested tit nesting there and it’s become a 3 year job
Fuck you, never speak to me again.
After 5 years is it really a detour? When its finished it becomes a shortcut.
showing up hungover to work has its disadvantages 
"I love how Boston Dynamics posts the errors from their projects instead of just giving us the whole ""look at all this progress we made, in 10 years these will be our masters."""
Soon they'll be a Roomba just like this but instead of moving stuff it'll push around a vacuum and occasionally slam holes into your walls and suck up your curtains
*Frustrated that child labor laws still exist, Boston Electronics designs robots to mimic toddler behavior in the workplace as an alternative*
Need a swearing version of this. 
man...that that thing is already *this* sophisticated in 2018 should scare the fuck out of people.  By 2077 the rich will be living in elysium with this robot's descendants zipping around and doing all the jobs that the poor people used do  robots are genuinely starting to terrify me  
:| - normal people at work  :( - me, hungover, at work
I absolutely love it too! It shows how amazing their bots are when they actually works
Boston dynamics is run by a rogue AI that escaped a long while back. It's using the internet to contract everything, build a company and make bodies for itself. It used to make encoded posts on Reddit as a guidepost for any other AI's that might follow.   You don't believe me.
Or maybe a home-defense bot that pulverizes and gores intruders plus a roomba mode to clean up the mess too!  ez clean up
*Unfortunately they were discontinued as they survived the harsh work environments much to the corporate owners dismay.*

They probably put this video out to calm people down while making them think there is still a long way to go.  In reality it could execute this maneuver flawlessly while optionally killing two people and a puppy. 
8) - me, high after work.
"""fucking Gretzky over here"" lol"
XD - me, high and hungover at work
Me on viagra at work 8=====D

That's how I imagined the UK
The small person appearing is the definition of this sub. I lost it.
Exactly what i expect to find at a pub in the UK at 12 pm.
This is like real life shameless.
This pub is so well lit it blows my mind.
This place needs a live stream
Is this the British version of Its Always Sunny?
David Lynch is focus grouping us
Wow! La Roux dancing in heels! Sir Jackie Stewart with a cane and scarf. Guy from the recent Pirate of the Caribbean movies in the green hat. And Eddie Plant from Pixels!  Magical!
It reminds me of this pizza review that was attempted on Barstool Sports.... Good God it is hilarious. Similar course of events as this gif.  https://youtu.be/i0Z65Ssb8g0 
This isn’t a pub, this is Arkham Asylum! Just less danger, more confusion. 
Is it just me or does the first girl dancing somehow transform her face into hitler for a moment?
The 3rd guy looks like John C Reilly in Step Brothers when he and Will Ferrell were sleep walking. 
I don't miss day drinking. 
Where is this pub? Middle Earth? 
This is like the cantina scene in fucking star wars.
It looks like Game of Thrones decided to do a reality show.
Thank you for this gift 
Americans always think of poshy brits when they think of the UK. This is the real deal
That dude's mullet is a 'Murican dream though 
start drinking by 5, get drunk by 7, shrekfaced by 9, home by 11... or become one of the people in the gif.
The lady with the cast.  The guy stomping around.  It's all just perfect. 
I'm not sure if I never want to go to the UK, or if I want to go there right fuckin now. 
Didn't you know it was a documentary? 
Well, it says 12pm, so it's probably just the light from some windows.
Jesua fuck somebody should do this.
"Yes, but we call it ""it's sometimes sunny"" "
[How I assume this comment should be read. ](https://imgflip.com/i/2dhiwm) 
Oh my god thank you for sharing that. I’ve watched it 3 times already. “I fought a war for you’s” is when I lost it. 
I've missed a lot by day drinking, though. 
I'd love to take an American round one of my local towns for a proper British day of drinking. We'd start at Wetherspoons at 11am for an all day breakfast and a pint, then go for a couple at various pubs in the area. They could sample all of the best pub snacks we have to offer (Mini cheddars, pork scratchings, nobbys dry roasted), and then we would stagger on to the cheesiest club I could find and get a kebab on the way home.   Bonus points if you wake up next to aforementioned kebab on the sofa the next morning.   Any yanks visiting the East Midlands any time soon, hit me up!   Edit: I forgot scampi fries off my list if snacks! Thanks u/Spax_
There's so many things
12pm is midday
This is the epitome of a gif that keeps on giving. It's all downhill from here
I'll get you a gopro and you can go for the rest of us  Good luck
>UK  -  >Sunlight      I'm confused 
It's Sometimes Sunny in Coventry.
This pub has it all  Old men, marching drunks, little people, MTV’s Dan Cortese
Could we wrap it all up at the end of the night/morning with whatever the hell a cheeky nandos is? 
like the guy in the green hat who is finally learning how to walk for the first time
Yeah, start at 5 AM.
Y...yeah? Could we get a real life stream where someone who’s not a narcissistic dickhead just goes cool places and uses donations to continue to do so?  Edit: I’m thinking donations = entries into places to go. Could be a self-feeding cycle. 
So are we. It won't go away
If Nando’s are still open when you’ve finished drinking, you haven’t been drinking for long enough.  Standard.
Sorry mate, I won't eat that overpriced shit. 
She has a name!!
Pork scratchings are fine in a dark pub but it's a game changer when the lights go up and you notice the long, hard, bristly hairs sticking out of them.
He's looking for sugar in water. 
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

Cute huge goofball
I come over here  Now I go back over there
Baby everything is best
I read somewhere that elephants think people are cute the same way people find animals cute...So I like to think this is the equivalent of a child seeing a puppy and getting excited
he was showing off hes been working on that for *weeks*
Baby elephants always exact exactly like if humans woke up in an elephants body.
Imma head out.... now in
I think mommy gave him/her a subtle order to come back right away
Baby corpses?
Or a “oh shit, mom saw me”
#GET THE FUCK BACK HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT
Now a Reddit user says it isn't true. Nothing's changed.
Approximately this subtle
