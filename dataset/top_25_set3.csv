Out of all of the success stories in this group, this is definitely the gold standard.  Congrats brother.
Dude, no bullshit. I work at Universal Studios in Orlando. I get free tickets. They are yours. As many as you want.    I went from 260lbs to 180lbs and owe my job to keto. Mad props.  -Edit- Well I wasn't expecting this.   This community has helped me a lot over the years and I had to ability to give back. This isn't really about me, it's about how great this community is and how encouraging everyone is on meeting our own personal goals together.   Thank you for the gold. As much as appreciate it, if you read this and feel the need to show your appreciation. Please instead donate the money you would have for gold to the charity of your choice.   I personally recommend; https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/semper-fi-fund/536  You guys are awesome! Now go eat some fucking bacon you beautiful people.
Good for you!   Please do plan that trip back to Potter World....  the new you will enjoy it so much moreüëç
Your story makes me cry. You should be proud and tell the world because this is just inspiring and amazing. 
wonderful! you saved your own life!!!!
You look like you actually deflated.  Like it's clear you're the same person.  Some people look entirely different, but your features seem constant somehow.  So like it's clear you deflated.  It takes guts and determination to do what you did.  Some people would have just accepted their fate and died of a coronary.  By the by, what did your doctor say with all that weight lost?
Speaking of gold...
You guys are really great to offer.  I've gotten multiple offers from people offering tickets.  I'm blown away.  I don't know what to say.  I'd feel like i was taking advantage of the community by accepting such generosity.  
This! If even a relatively small percentage of the keto community pitched in a few dollars, we could send him back for that Potter World vacation! I‚Äôd pitch in!
Don't you fucking dare
Fuck.  That.   Noise.  Go to Universal for free and enjoy yourself.  On your deathbed I promise you your final thought won‚Äôt be ‚ÄúI regret accepting kindness from others‚Äù.  
If not, one could always bind dark manuals in them. 
Someone fucking dared
Hi internet stranger!  I'm proud of you!  What a fantastic change, and you look so incredibly happy in your second picture =D
It's a visible difference... almost like in the first picture, he's smiling because that's what we do when posing for a picture.  In the second, it's such a bigger, brighter, honestly happy smile... it makes me want to smile too.
what is your social security number? nice job
That's just the mercury typing
That heavy pic was actually 2 years ago at probably my heaviest, but I've been keto since last April.  Here is Django (cat) now in case you needed an update ;} http://imgur.com/Aw3cyJf  edit-sorry I screwed up the B&A order, and about the grammatical error.  Just ignore that, and focus on the cute cat.   Edit 2 and last. Thanks for all the love, and kind words!  For those requesting more Django, here he is!  http://imgur.com/i21642W  He's not overweight at all, so the accusations of abuse and overfeeding are unwarranted. 
You look 10 years younger, legitimately. I'm floored. Also your cat is AMAZING.
This order makes it look like you gained a ton of weight.  It made me wonder if people who are depressed after gaining weight ever post their old, thinner pictures with their new heavier ones and pretend they lost weight...
That cat is majestic..
Looks like at least 50lbs to me! Congrats! bacon confetti!!
If you'd just posted the pictures and asked us to guess how much you'd lost, I'd have said you'd lost a helluva lot more!! o.o
Yeah, was just sitting here thinking it looks like a *lot* more than 23 pounds but I guess its better to look like you have lost more than looking like you have lost less. 
That's true!! When I loose the next 23 lbs I'll post this photo for comparison to see how much of a difference it makes. 
Probably developed muscle while losing fat, which would explain why the 23 pounds looks so dramatic. You look fantastic! 
Hey man, better claim the username MEDIUM_Texan pretty asap! 200 in a year? Damn dude that‚Äôs outstanding! 
So happy to see this. I've never spoken with you before, but see you popping up on threads all the time offering support and being cheerleader in chief for so many people throughout their journeys.   You seem like such a great person and I'm really happy you've met your goal - 200lb lost is a phenomenal achievement and it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.   Here's to your next goal!
Did you know that a kangaroo weighs approx. 200 pounds? You just lost a whole fucking kangaroo, man. Congratulations! 
The difference in your facial expression says it all.  
"I have saved ""ExBigTexan5606"" but I am not sure if I will use it or not.  Thank you for the positivity!"
Haha, came here to say this! A buddy of mine at work used to call me Big Bear but not since I lost 58 pounds in the last 3 1/2 months. He said he'll have to start calling me Medium or Jr. Bear.
I'm Roo free :)
You are still a big Texan, just in accomplishment and inspiration rather than mass 
Dude, you win. Everything. Well done, this is CRAZY levels of inspirational!! Thank you so much for sharing it all with us, what an amazing person you are for working so hard and kicking so much ass!
Congratulations! This is very inspiring. Enjoy your new found life!
What do we tell the God of Death? Not tonight! ....Congratulations!
Holy. Ever loving.  Fuck.  You win...you win weightloss, you win self control, you win life, you win *everything*.  You're an ordinary guy who won *everything* and I hope you know how extraordinary that is.  I wish i could hug you.  Or high five you.  Or buy you a drink...or a steak.    Dude, you nailed it.

Not just keto recipe blogs. Every damn food blog.  Oh, and 20 HUGE photos of the same thing from \*slightly\* different angles. 
The reason why is that the original text and photos are necessary for search engine optimization.
"It's an SEO tactic. More content (to a certain point) = higher authority ranking. And you can't just repeat the same crap over and over (unless it's the keyword phrase you are trying to rank for) or else Google will demote you. So you get these 1000+ word posts that could have simply been 150 words and a recipe.   Also, it's a good way to make space for banner ads and calls-to-action (""sign up!"" ""get the free ebook!"" etc)."
Your post reminds me a lot of a story my grandma used to tell.  It all started back during the war...  :)
HERE, TAKE YOUR KARMA, WHORE! thanks for this :)
Came to suggest this - the Firefox version has totally changed my ability to plow through recipes.
The more you keep scrolling the weirder they get. First it‚Äôs from the side, then it‚Äôs from above, then it‚Äôs from across the other side of the table, then it‚Äôs at a full dinner table with other similar dishes, then it‚Äôs google Earth, then it‚Äôs from space and the link redirects you to the NASA homepage
They do it because of SEO, the longer their post is and more relevant words they can cram in then the higher they rank.
"Haha yeah, that's why there's always weird sentences in the backstory like, ""I hope you'll love these Gluten-Free Keto-Friendly Almond Flour 1-Minute Microwave Mug Cakes as much as my son loved these Gluten-Free Keto-Friendly Almond Flour 1-Minute Microwave Mug Cakes."""
Already the best posting of the day! You win at everything.
To my awesome and amazing Mom,  So DAMN. PROUD. OF. YOU!  You have always been an inspiration in my life.  A non-Hodgkins cancer survivor of now 16 years. You quit smoking.  And now beat your final demon by losing weight. Because of YOUR hard work you‚Äôve given me and my husband so many more years with you. You got to see me marry, have two beautiful children that love their Grammie, and now you get to continue to watch them grow, enjoy sleepovers and watch them graduate from high school.  All because you‚Äôve continued making you a priority. So damn proud.   Love you mom!
You look like two different women in those pictures! Oh man, this is a great post. Thanks for the early-morning heartwarm. :) Keep kickin' ass. You're amazing.
You. are. AMAZING! When I grow up I wanna be just like you lol. My dreams for retirement (10 years to go!) are all about hiking the big trails and seeing the National Parks. You‚Äôre an inspiration. You did this, I can do this too. Thank you for sharing your courage and determination!
Thank you so much.
Damn daughter, will you never stop making me cry! Thank you for starting me on this road. You helped me get through some of the toughest things a person can survive by being there for me. You make me so damn proud too ‚Äî a daughter, a wife, a mother, a Major in the Air Force (18 years and counting), and look at your numbers!   Couldn‚Äôt have done any of it without you! I love you baby girl.
I feel very different. I am so much more energized, wanting to go places and doing things, I dreamt of but knew I‚Äôd never go there or do that. Health wise, it‚Äôs so much better, my blood pressure is perfect, my heartburn almost completely gone, sleeping easier, I‚Äôm very pleased with the results of doing KETO. It works.
Holy shit! That‚Äôs gobsmacking transformation! Wow congratulations and great job. You‚Äôre a winning loser. This is the most amazing change I‚Äôve seen!
You may be ordinary (though I doubt it), but your transformation and apparent stubbornness are *extraordinary*!  Thanks so much for sharing with us.
I‚Äôve been over 500.  I‚Äôm currently hovering around 380.  Keep it up.  I would love to be down in the low 200s. 225 is my dream.  I haven‚Äôt been 225 since high school.  
Maybe talk to your primary care physician and tell them that the loose skin is causing you physical pain and mental distress. With a referral, your insurance Miiiiight pay for the skin removal. It's worth looking into, anyway.
you have my respect ma'am!!
Yours is a great story.  I wish I had started this when I was 28 instead of 44...
You should write a book. I‚Äôd buy it.
WOE = way of eating I had to google it so I'm sharing
I think I'm more impressed that you're 73 and a redditor. Respect!
The Bear, who was the Grateful Dead's sound man, ate a meat only diet for most of his adult life. Died in a car crash at the age of 82.
I feel like I do need to point out that this is anecdotal evidence. Whilst I commend you on what you‚Äôre doing and how healthy you feel. This isn‚Äôt cause to say that it‚Äôs purely down to your diet etc. There are plenty of people I know who eat like crap and drink beer every day and are in their eighties and doing just fine.   Different strokes for different folks and all that. 
Pressing F
and my axe!
It isn't easy to constantly go against the river, believe me, but in the long run I decided momentary pleasure wasn't worth being old and sick.
Sorry. WOL (way of life).
Must admit that I found this subreddit looking for something else. I'm a webmaster.
Moral of the story... don't keto and drive
I agree. In the low carb forum I frequent, it's called n=1. That's an experiment with one person in it ~ ME. However, everybody else in that forum (166,914 members today) is also on the same path.  Every BODY is different, however, I come from a gene pool where every other woman on the paternal side has T2D. I was motivated not to join them.
"Eating keto throws the numbers out of whack, but the ratios should remain ""good."" Triglycerides (TG) go way down, but other numbers go up. Doctors get confused by this. If my numbers prompt the doctor to recommend statins, I just say no. I just say no to Big Pharma and Big Food."
Of course I strayed. Everybody pops sometimes. I found it easier to eat off plan after a few drinks. Along the way I went back to college and became a certified chef. All the time I worked in restaurants, I ate carbs. Life is long and nobody gives prizes for what we eat or don't eat. The motivation has to be strong. The goal is always there, even if we ignore it.
The two of you (and other professional chefs on this sub) need to get together and write LCHF recipe book. There are many good options but a guy can only eat a certain amount of cauliflower and not get sick of it.
*Not that much??* You do yourself a disservice by playing down this phenomenal progress you have made.  You've shed nearly a third of your body weight so far! Amazing!
Hey ketoers! I just want to thank all you guys. You have been a huge help, and continue to be. I'm not done losing weight, but i'm getting closer to my goal every day.   Also I know im not the most beutiful person, and i'm ok with that :D
Fuck it's not much! It is very, very much! Don't see yourself as someone who did something little. You did something most of the overweight people will never do. You looked at the best solution and kept with it!   **You are the man!**  EDIT: typo
"Kid, don't say you're not the most beautiful person. You've grown up carrying a lot of extra weight, and you're still very young. You don't even know what person is really going to be under all the extra weight yet.   You're making excellent progress, and one day soon you're going to stand in front of that mirror as a fully grown man who can be proud that he's accomplished something so big at an age where most things come easy.   Cheers to you and what you've done so far. You're looking fantastic, and the choices you're making now are going to improve the whole rest of your life. Just know that some random stranger on the internet is incredibly proud of you, and can't wait to see you progress further.   PS- Now is the perfect time to start hitting the weights hard and heavy if you're not already. You can put some muscle on the big 6'3"" frame and start a lifetime of not only good eating, but excellent physical activity habits as well.   All the best mate. "
Good on you for breaking the cycle, and for sharing your story. Its one that resonates with me and I'm sure a lot of people here.
As much as it sucks that you have to watch your family do this to themselves, you should be so proud of your fire to be the one that beats this shit.  Anger can be a useless emotion, but can also be the thing that makes you refuse to accept the status quo.  To *change* things.  Anger coupled with action is one hell of a force.   Keep doing what you're doing, improving your life and your health. Maybe one of these days It'll click for the people around you too.  Even if it doesn't, just breaking the cycle and taking control of your life is huge.
"My entire family falls into the overweight to obese category. I can attest that we don't have the world's greatest metabolism, but the entire family also eats terribly.  I've got about 30 pounds to go to my goal weight, and anytime I'm below 200 pounds ""I'm 6'4, so that's the right range"", I start getting the ""are you sick, you're too skinny"" comments.  Oh well, I've been eating healthy & exercising regularly for nearly a decade. My goal this year is to get to 185-190 and stick to it from here on out. I want to be active at 80 years old. Not dead.  And at 6'4, these joints have got to last me a long while because I'm hard to move.  Great job OP, you can change your & your kids futures!"
The carbohydrate highs and lows really are an addiction.  I was on it for decades.  And addicted people simply are not rational.  I know I wasn't.  I stopped bringing any carb heavy foods home.  I'd then find myself, late at night, in the car driving to a frozen yogurt place and not remember even getting in the car. :)  I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR7H9xeMYME) earlier today about how carbohydrate metabolism affects the brain and behavior.  Very interesting stuff.
Well if I can't inspire my family at home, maybe I can convince somebody new here that this life is a better life.  KCKO.
Practically all of my moms side of the family has diabetes. That‚Äôs not to say my dad‚Äôs side is perfect either, but diabetes really scared my mom. My parents (particularly my mom) saw her future if she wasn‚Äôt careful. Already losing her parents to diabetes she became a health freak. So much so, that she influenced my dad too. So what‚Äôs the story here? Well, my parents both are diabetes free & raised three kids who are also diabetes free. She was able to influenced her sisters to jump on bored too. It all starts with one person & I believe your lifestyle change will be contagious and overtime will help your family.
Great job!  Keep it up. :-)
"Wow! Thank you for all the lovely and supportive comments! :) I'm sorry for not replying to everyone, I posted this just before I left the house thinking it wouldn't get much attention only to come back to dozens of comments! A few people are asking how I've done it and how long it took, so I'll address it here. :) I started I believe around November 2012, I started with hardcore keto and had lost about 15kgs when my ""before"" photo was taken. Sadly, I don't have any of me at my max weight. I did take some secret ones, but my phone broke and I lost them. :( I only have a couple that were taken by other people when I already lost 10-20kgs. Anyways, I've been on and off strictly dieting for the last year or so as my life has been pretty chaotic... New jobs, moving interstate, family issues, travelling etc... So sometimes my actual weight loss itself stalled for a few weeks/months but thankfully I never put weight back on. Now that my life has settled back down I am fully focused once again and hope to reach my goal weight by my 25th birthday in May next year. :)   I was completely miserable at my biggest and pretty much throughout my entire life... I've always struggled with depression, ever since I was little, but by my teenage years I was completely hopeless and suicidal. I had pretty much given up on life by age 21 and just accepted I would be sad and fat forever. I reached my lowest point just before I stated dieting in 2012, I actually contemplated suicide a lot and the only reason I didn't do it was because I felt obligated to stick around and look after my pets. I eventually stumbled onto /r/keto after seeing it mentioned in someone's comment. I saw all the pictures and posts and people who were just as big as me if not bigger losing weight and I was inspired. Of course I had tried every diet under the sun over the years but I always struggled to stick to them. Once I started keto and saw the weight finally coming off, I was so happy and I couldn't believe it. I started losing more and more and became happier and happier. Suddenly life didn't seem so bad anymore and I actually WANTED to be alive... I wanted to have an amazing life where I could do anything I wanted. I never used to see a future for myself but now I have a million dreams and things I want to achieve. I still struggle with depression sometimes as it has been a really difficult journey for me, physically and emotionally... But I'm getting there. I feel like a completely new person, which can also be difficult to deal with sometimes... But I would never go back to who I used to be or how I used to feel, not for anything.   It was the little things that kept me motivated along the way... Walking into a non-plus size store and buying things that actually fit me. Walking briskly up a flight of stairs without even losing my breath. Borrowing someone's jumper and actually having it fit. Wrapping a regular sized towel around my body. Sitting down without having to worry if the chair was going to hold me or not. Things that must sound so stupid and mundane to other people made me so happy and gave me so much motivation to keep going.  I still have another 30kgs or more I'd like to lose, but I'm confident I can get there! I feel like I've come such a long way now that 30kgs doesn't even feel like that much to me anymore. I can't wait until I get there. :)  Oh, and to those who are asking, I got the polka dot dress from modcloth.com! :)"
Gorgeous. you should be brimming with pride!
Ha! I fell for it. Good work!
Click bait title is such click bait, I like it :)
Hello digital marketing professional.
I was platinum mad when I read the title.  Fucker.  Good job though.
That right there was master bait.
Amazing dude! What a journey! Keep inspiring others.
Holy fuck man, you‚Äôre my idol. I wish my dad followed your path before he left us.   Keep up the good work sir!
Thanks!  I'll keep sharing - it was a post like this that led me to a macro calculator that made things black and white - hopefully it rolls forward and ignites a stranger's path.    Edit - I think all the calculators follow the same logic - find one and stick with it, the one that I started with is no longer.
Thanks a ton, as a dad of two - this really resonates, sorry to hear of your loss.
Wow man. That statement hits me pretty fuckin hard. I got 3 boys and I know I got to stay with it this time around or they will lose me. I absolutely dont want them to have to go through that shit because I didnt take care of it when I could. I'm down 40 pounds and still got a long road but reading a comment like that is for sure a wake up call to see it through for life.
Good lord dude. This is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen posted on Reddit! You have changed your entire life man, this is beyond inspiring!  Just reading this makes me want to go do things that I've been afraid to do all my life!  I don't think you know how important it is to post things like this. This is so important for other people to see because so many people struggle with all kinds of problems, not just their weight, but all sorts of things in their life, things that they feel like they'll never be able to change. This should give anybody hope and courage. There's like 20 people at my work I'm going to show this to right now.   Thank you so much for posting! And obviously it goes without saying congratulations, you're more than the man of the hour!  EDIT:  Also if I were you I would never throw away that big -ass shirt. In fact I'd fold it up and I'd put it in a fuckin' frame and I'd put it on my wall the way some people do their wedding picture or their diploma or military honors. You should keep it as a visual reminder of what you were able to do to give you strength for the rest of your life.
Inspiring man. I'm doing Keto and started at 585. I got down to 510 then slipped back to 545.  Back below 530 and moving forward every day.   Keep it up man, you're doing amazing and inspiring so many people. 
There's an old man in Texas that is very happy to read your post.  FULL of questions and FULL of happiness.                What has been your biggest victory?  I don't mean the 300 pounds lost, because that is obviously a hell of a victory.  A damn fine good job.  But what is the ONE thing you are proudest of changing in your life?  Of improving in your life?               Next, what's it like being normal?  Just a regular dude wanting to lose a bit of weight?  What's life like when you are normal?  I hope that question makes sense.                Do you still deal with friends and family who see you and treat you as the 545 pound guy?  I freakin' hate that.                 Damn it must be nice to not have to shop at big and tall stores.  Walking into Dillard's and buying off the rack clothes ON SALE.             I love what you have done. Love it because at 25 years old, you have completely changed the course of your life.  Love what you have done because YOU are lighting my path so to speak.  Thank you for this.  Thank you for posting today.  HOPE.  You have given me even more HOPE.  Thank you.
Thank you! And I definitely plan on keeping it as a reminder of where I was and were I want to be. 
Absolutely AMAZING! GO YOU GOOD THING! Congrats on the weight loss, the life change and thank you for inspiring me to stick with it! KCKO! <3
Holy smokes! Look at the years falling off of you! You are an inspiration!
Thank you! I still have a long ways to go but when people tell me that I inspire them, it actually inspires me to stick with it. 
Thanks! I feel amazing now. I went from barely being able to walk around the block to doing a 5k (not running yet but I plan on getting there!). I would say the biggest difference I've noticed is just how much better I feel. I remember just being so depressed but keto has cleared up all of that for me. =) 
EMBARRASSED???  Ma'am, you look wonderful!!!  What a fantastic thing you have done for yourself.  Just WON DER FUL!!!
The rough part of posts like this is knowing you had/have negative feelings about how you appeared before.    Beautiful then, beautiful now.  The important thing is that you are happier with yourself.
Holy shit girl, that‚Äôs awesome.
Wow, you made my day! Thank you! 
*Starting* to show?  That's incredible progress! :D
i feel like you were a lot funnier before tho
Actually, his wording makes total sense to me. I had never experienced body dysmorphia <or insert proper term here> until keto. I, too, started close to his weight and I'm near his end weight and I would claim I've barely changed.   Never mind my pants now officially don't work without belts and some of my belts need new holes... I still see that chub in the chest and stomach and it feels like it hasn't changed at all. All that logical evidence has little to do with my belief system. Omg. Now keto taught me what religious people feel. Dare I say miracle?!
JESUS CHRIST. KETO TURNED YOU INTO A 19 YEAR OLD POP SENSATION.  No seriously. You look amazing. Congrats and I hope the wedding goes great!
Dear god, you've lost 10 years!
I've been on keto since august 2014, and it has been great. It's my first time doing strict keto, meaning no more than 25 carbs per day and eating at a calorie deficit 99% of the time. My past two attempts I did the lazy keto, eating everything which had less than 5% carbs in it, which worked to an extent. I regained my weight both times though after stopping.   This time I've stuck to it the entire time, tracking everything I eat under a microscope, and now I've reached some kind of goal. I'm getting married on saturday, and boy am I glad that my wedding pictures won't look like I'm 35 and about to die an early death.   I've been blessed by having such great support during my weight loss. First of all, you guys. All of you helping each other out has truly been an inspiration and it has helped me to inspirate others with my pictures. My fianc√©e has been helping out aswell. Even though she doesn't approve of my lifestyle since she's a vegan, she has supported me whole heartedly and even did some ketoing herself including a lot of tofu.   Thanks again /r/keto for your endless support.   EDIT: Wedding pictures are to be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3huccr/update_nsv_pics_coping_wedding_pictures_one_year/).
Transformation from father to son :D
I am absolutely SHOCKED! well done, man! you went from unattractive middle-aged dude to sexy as f*ck 20-something guy! genetics my ass!
Oh my god! Without the progress photos I would legit not believe the first and last are the same man. Right on man, that must feel so good.
HOLY SHIT! I've seen bigger losses in this sub, but I've *never* seen such a complete transformation! You look *amazing*, congrats! Do people that you haven't seen in awhile even recognize you?
This is a joke, right? This is a progressive photo array of how a handsome young emo kid graduated from high school, began to realize the world was as he feared, got fat, grew a mustache, and shaved his head in defeat. Right?
Wow, what happened? This is like watching an exquisite butterfly emerging from a chubby caterpillar. 
Somewhere around those last two pictures he mastered that male model face.   This is one of those progress pictures where I really didn't believe it was the same person until I went backwards a few times. 
He's got the blue steel down.  Shaving the pedo-tache helped immensely too.
Yep went from 45 year old to 20 year old
I was thinking closer to 20! He looks late thirties at least in the first photo, early twenties in the last. Although I think the scrotum-goatee didn't help.
Holy shit you went from bald Ron Swanson to goddamn Julian Casablancas.   Congratulations, and have a wonderful wedding. You worked very hard for this :)
Please update with wedding photos when everything has settled down after the celebrations. I think we would all love to see the final results! 
But why male models ? 
"hhah that was my husbands reaction when I showed him these pics ""Amazing what a few sit ups and shaving off the pedo-stache will do"".  You ave both killed me. I am dead now."
[Before](http://imgur.com/sfVj5Hq)  [After](http://imgur.com/TU6tmbB)
Holy crap, those are 2 different people!
"Thanks guys and gals for the kind words! As someone has already pointed out I have a ""long way to go"" but we are happy and are building a healthier life together! I have lost 83 pounds and all the negative comments and down votes can't change how happy I am."
Conhrats!
For a moment I thought this was a joke post.  With your tan, and with the shadow cast upon your face, I thought the first photo had a light-skinned black man and the second photo a white man.  Great job you two!
This is why I stick to bacon and whiskey.
GOD DAMMIT!  No wonder I'm stalled.  I eat two of these a day.  There ought to be a law.
Costco takes feedback seriously.  Return your box saying you aren't satisfied/its misleading, and fill out a comment card.
"More people need to read this. I post about it now when I see them recommended and everyone just says ""they seem to be fine!"" Maybe for your wallet but not for keto."
"I've been meaning to post about these bars saying ""are they too good to be true?""    I guess the answer to that is ""yes"""
Breakfast of champions right there.
if they are actively committing fraud, then yeah, there's a case to be had here, i would imagine.
Costco is absolutely amazing on feedback and returns!   If there‚Äôs any issue with any of their products, absolutely return it, be honest, and let them know. They are one of my favorite companies to buy from and the return policy is awesome.   (I‚Äôve returned a year old air fan that started smoking with no issues, I return produce with no problems, etc. I don‚Äôt abuse it but when 1 out of 6 avocados turn out fine, there‚Äôs a problem... I already waited a week for them to ripen!).   Ps - avocados in winter and from Mexico is the best season to buy from Costco.   They are by far one of the best places to shop.
T1 diabetic here, I have no problem with the quest bars but the costco bars spike my blood sugar like crazy.
Yeah, but what about second breakfast?
Label laws in general are weak as fuck in America.
Ham and bourbon
Elevensies?
Ham in your right hand, bourbon in the left.
I prefer ham in the left,  whiskey in the right.    But i'm not going to judge you..... ^^fuckin' ^^^weirdo....
You look great girl!
man, great progress! keep up good work :)
How you feelin?
One pushup will someday turn into 10 pushups. Maybe even 100. Definitely not lame man. Keep up the hard work. 
One push-up today.... Tomorrow, who knows?!?      I applaud your tenacity and cheer you on ! 
I love how many positive responses this got. You‚Äôre absolutely killing it man. The difference is very clear in your pic and I love how you‚Äôre measuring your own success, ‚Äòwaking without stopping‚Äô for a km is a darn good goal. The comment you made halfway down the responses is great: why are you walking in the cold? ‚ÄúCause I can!!!‚Äù. Fucking awesome work man. Keep it up! Kick some ass and keep us updated! 
One push-up is more than I can do. Good job my dude. 
Yes!!! You‚Äôre killing it man. You should be so proud of yourself 
Awesome! Keep it up, dude! And FUCK YEAH on that push up! Progress is progress. 
Excellent work brother! And don‚Äôt you technically lift like 64% of your body weight during a push-up? There‚Äôs a lot of people that can‚Äôt bench that number. As another big guy losing weight having that secret muscle is great. I keep telling myself it burns calories faster lol. 
RemindMe! 1 year
Exactly how it's meant to be done, with repetition and consistency. Working your ass off for one week and then not doing anything the next week is not sustainable, only working hard and doing it every time, no exceptions. OP is doing a fantastic job, keep at it!
Out of prison. 
100 push ups 100 sit ups 100 squats and a 10km run every day  also eat breakfast even if it is only a banana
Tomorrow is also likely 1 pushup 
Thanks, I sure will! 
I‚Äôm so excited about doing stuff - ‚Äúwhy are you walking to the store - it‚Äôs -10‚Äù ..... BECAUSE I CAN. 
I started working as a semi truck driver in July last year that kick started this whole thing. Pulling myself up into a truck 5-10 times a day apparently had an effect on me. 
I am cheering for you for a year 
Dude, I've kept an eye on your posts since you started, and yeah, keep it up man! You're doing awesome!
That's just a standard training regiment.
I‚Äôm gonna do my one tomorrow and try for some ‚Äúgirl‚Äù ones on my knees to take some of the pressure off of my back. 
HELL YEAH YOU CAN. It‚Äôs those little things like that, that are actually the biggest deals and make all the difference and all worth it 
But, if you keep doing it every day, month after month, year after year... you too will be able to defeat an enemy in one punch.
Bruh you're carrying around a lot of pounds in that gut. 1 push up is no joke when you're lifting 200lb or someshit. People forget pushups are based on bodyweight, the lighter you are the less muscle you need. 1 push up is still really good, you need quite a bit of muscle and even cardio stamina a to push that much weight off the floor. When you get to 5 you'll be deezed under there and then al u gotta do is keep cutting. 
This is by far the greatest title/progress picture combo I've ever seen!! Congrats on your success!
You look great !! What's the time span of the 2 pictures ??
My heart! What a good example to be shown here, congrats!!
Title game on point though
Good for you buddy! I‚Äôm a Keto guy new to this sub, but you‚Äôve inspired me to be this kind of example to my son as well!
about a year
No it was my heart. Literally. I had a heart attack a little over a year ago at 36.
Sad thing is I hadn't even hit the top of my curve in the first picture. I was too embarrassed to have pictures at the time. This was at a family funeral for my brother who died of heat disease. My number was almost up the next month for the same thing.
Great transformation, and your hair is 10/10
The only thing that got bigger was your hair üòÜ.  What was your time frame?
Wow you look gorgeous ‚ù§Ô∏è
You have an hourglass shape now. Good job.
I loooove your hair!!!!
That‚Äôs one hell of a glow up, nice!
WOWZA!  You look INCREDIBLE!  And I bet you feel so much better physically!
Her everything is 10/10
Exactly what I was going to say. Her hair looks like my daughters
Great transformation and- ah shit.  LISTEN YOUR HAIR IS SOME LEVEL OF COOL THAT EVERY PERSON CRAVES
Lol yes it did! It took 2 years total, but that‚Äôs because I kept gaining weight back that I lost! This August, I implemented IF when I got to 190, and then lost 40lbs in the past 4 months!  Edit: 35lbs can‚Äôt do math right :(
Thank you so much!
Thank you. Yeah that was the biggest shock of all this, I‚Äôve always been overweight and I never knew I had a shape underneath!
Thanks! Sometimes I wanna just cut it all off lol it‚Äôs hard to deal with
Thank you. Yes, I do feel a lot better. I used to be self conscious about what people thought of me when I was in public. But now I realize literally nobody cares lol
16:8! Sorry, I should‚Äôve included that!
Your daughters are brown, round and fuzzy?
That‚Äôs awesome. As someone who has also gained weight back, your post is very inspiring! Keep up the great work
Wow! May I ask if you used anything on your skill to help elasticity and stretch marks? You look great, well done üòÅ
Wow, congratulations on your perseverance and sticking to it! Amazing results. I lost about 40 lb and have 25lb to go, and your post inspired me big time!!! Thank you for sharing your progress.
No skin issues. Wow. I guess it can be a genetic thing. And it doesn't look like your skin is too loose on the before picture. Perhaps once the skin is stretched too far, it will lose its ability to bounce back. Incredible progress!
I would like to respond. People are making a lot of assumptions about my stretch marks and loose skin. I am riddled with stretch marks. They are lighter in color so they did not show up as much on camera but I‚Äôm sure if you zoom and add detail you could see them. I have them severely on my stomach and my arms, as well as my chest area.  I also have loose skin on my inner thighs, arms, and breasts. I am no exception to the negative side of weight loss. It is just not outright visible in this picture.   Please upvote so people can see.
Hijacking the top comment (sorry) for those who want to know the method of OP:  >I eat for 6 hours, fast for 18. For two days of the week, I do a consecutive water fast üòä  [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/bsbtr5/i_lost_a_person_135_lbs_in_13_months_if_618_48/eolobu9/)
Same question and also just what you did/ate, etc bc YOU ARE GOALS
From /r/all, how tf does a person eat for 6 hours
She doesn't eat for 6 hours lol she eats her daily caloric intake over the course of 6 hours, and then fasts for 18....much of which, she is asleep. It's surprisingly doable!
TIL I've been intermittent fasting for the past few years. No breakfast, lunch at 1pm , dinner at 7pm.
the college diet
Gin still has calories.
Gin has semen?
If you're doing it right
Wow what a smile! Good for you!
Beautiful! (Slight homo)  Edit: fuck it, full homo.
You look incredible! Gorgeous smile before and after!
Thank you!
"""Having big boobs when you're fat is like saying you have a fast car because it's falling off a cliff.""   You look MUCH better, don't sweat it. <3"
Upvoted purely for the title.  Also, it's way easier to get a push up bra than to lose all that weight. :)  Way to put in the work.  Edited due to typo
You look amazing and you still have boobs. Take it from a large chested 61 year old... Big boobs droop with age. I‚Äôm hoping to get rid of mine this year with exercise and eating better. And, to all the younger women out there: Lose it *before* menopause!
They are still big and look great in that shirt. More importantly, they look better especially in proportion to your body. Size isn't everything when it comes to boobs. Plus, look at those hips!
YAAAAAAAAS WITH THE LOW-CUT CROP TOP GET IT!!!!
Awesome transformation! You look fabulous!!!
You can buy boobs
""
> You can rent boobs  FTFY  My sister tells me that boob jobs need to be redone every decade or so.  It's not a one-and-done thing or the rest of your life.
/r/insanepeoplereddit
holy crap, you look so much younger. that‚Äôs crazy. congrats. üôÇ
Down** not fown haha.  Also important, I added a lot of walking into my routine. 3-5 miles at least 3 times a week, and eventually added lifting into the mix.   I'm usually 18:6 but lately I've been 20:4  Edit: wow, thank you all so much. I didn't think this post would get past the IF sub, but seeing so many people say how inspired they were made me very, very glad that it did. I'm sorry I haven't replied to everybody yet, it got a bit overwhelming, but I'll do my best to respond to each question, comment or PM, this week.   Thank you all for the kind words, and even the criticisms. And thank you very much for the several golds and silvers. It's amazing to see the outpouring of support   I will add some relevant links here soon for anybody interested in starting this kind of life change.
I love how your beard is the fattest thing on you. Congrats and keep kicking ass.
Keto + IF = Melting  Great work!
You... win.   That's all.   You've won the Internet today.   And life. Yes, life as well.   Life and the Internet -- yours for the taking.   Well done, man. Just... freaking well done!
Dude your old photo looks so much like me right now and this got me stoked bro. Congrats man
Seriously, OP lost age.
The warrior diet.  Not sure easy at all.  You have a strong mind and control.
Haha thank you
Yo, what's IF? I would google it but you know.  Edit: came here from all, didn't see what sub I was in till I had already posted something dumb.
I don‚Äôt know about others but I‚Äôve logged 50 fasts and after a while 20:4 just happens by accident. It‚Äôs not easy or hard it just happens. I simply don‚Äôt feel like eating. I used to binge eat junk food and would eat before any exercise or stressful activity thinking I needed the ‚Äúfuel.‚Äù It‚Äôs crazy how little food it takes to actually do everything you need in life: Work, workouts, etc.
International Frenching
Cold all the time, yes. Probably equal parts losing fat and not getting enough potassium haha. Other than that, the biggest change that I see day to day is that I can shop for clothes at ANY clothing store now. I don't have to just go to Duluth or the Big and Tall section at Penney's. Also, oddly, my reflexes have me feeling like Spiderman. I mean I'm still clumsy because I drop shit all the time, but now I'm catching the shit I drop. So, like, drunk Spiderman maybe? Also people talk to me more often in public, which is weird and hard to get used to. I always assume they're trying to sell me their pyramid scheme at first then I remember that I'm no longer painful to look at. So that's new and interesting.
Straight up, you aren't painful to look at in either picture, but in the first one you look more like a metal head, which tends to intimidate people, and in the second, well... Hipsters aren't exactly known for striking fear into the hearts of anyone but subpar baristas.
Where'd you put the 20 years you lost? LOL!
You went from being random middle aged man at a grocery store to a guy who would approach me at a bar, seriously 20 years younger!
I see below you didn't really do a lot of exercise in order to get where you are. My husband has many of the same symptoms and pains that you mention, and avoids exercising because quite simply it hurts. Do you find that the pain has diminished since the weight loss to the point that exercising is more doable? Husband isn't terribly overweight but has an apple shape (trying to word it kindly), has had cardiac events, and is at high risk for more. I wonder if keto would be helpful in getting him to the place where he can go walking/hiking/etc with me for heart health.
Real talk, he does look about 20 years younger.
Damn, I'm sure I have it around here, somewhere... lemme look...  Lol, thanks!
My son called me King Pizza. That‚Äôs when I decided to lose weight lol.
After I lost weight I had a friends kid ask if I layed an egg
Haha this is awesome. Congratulations man, you look incredible!
Hahaha, kids say the darndest things.
Lol! Never found out, miscarriage!
This was about 10 months on and off, meaning I would cheat a lot and miss days on IF. Had I been more consistent I think I would‚Äôve hit the 70-80 mark.
DUDE! You look awesome. C'mon tho, that's more than 50 lbs with your skinny jeans. LOL Why do I want to say you remind me of a movie star or maybe it was a musician in the after photo? I'm really leaning towards movie star. I can place the face...but my mind is feeble. It will come to me out of the blue next week some time.  At any rate, Congratulations are in order bro. Keep up the good work.
You look great.  Not sure if just the photos, but you look 10 years younger.  Congratulations!
Similar stats! Im at 128lbs 5‚Äô1, 115 is the goal :)
this is another level of inspiration. people who are morbidly obese that shed over a hundred pounds are amazing stories where someone who has reached rock bottom and don‚Äôt want to die are heroes but you show people how drastic a difference of just 20 pounds can make and that makes you a hero of a sort as well. people need to have this push if they‚Äôre not happy about a little pudge. no more ‚Äúthis pouch won‚Äôt go away‚Äù. you‚Äôre showing a different ‚Äúdistrict‚Äù of unhappy/unhealthy some motivation and i thank you.
Thank you! I just turned 31 last month ü•≥
It always helped me seeing women with similar stats, it‚Äôs crazy how a few pounds on shorter people make such a huge difference!
Mostly just 16:8 fasting and eating less bad stuff. I‚Äôd eat dinner at 5pm and then have breakfast at around 9am-10am or so. I did a few 24 hour fasts here and there and one time I made it all the way to 48 hours.   As far as what I ate, I had a lot of burritos and pitas with chicken, salsa, spinach or spring mix, and a sauce like homemade yogurt dressing for the pitas and avocado ranch for burritos.
It looks like you turned 38 5 years ago and just turned 21 last year. You should be proud.
For real. First pic looks like late 30s, second pic looks like mid 20s. 10+ year difference between the two pics, insane progress!
I just tried to eat healthier in general. Every time I would try to count calories or macros in MyFitnessPal or other apps I would get overwhelmed. I did try to go for lower calorie food though. I love the Joseph‚Äôs Whole Wheat Pitas that are 60 calories for the whole pita, but I would cut them in half and stuff them with spinach, tomatoes, and chicken.
I do have an outfit that does actually fit. lol! I wanted to wear my old 6xl shirt to compare to this old pic I took. That 6xl feels like a sheet on me.
Seriously, only 30? You look like you have lost more than that! You look awesome. Great progress!!!
You look 60lbs lighter.
Hope this is not a stupid question. I‚Äôm new here in this sub and am wondering why not many details are usually given regarding what is actually being eaten during the eating window. Did you keep track of calories at all? What was your eating strategy? Thank you.
Right! Is OP like 3 foot tall? Never seen such a drastic 30 before and after.
Most people who keep to a short 2 to 4 hour window find that they don't need to track calories.   Can you eat 3000 calories or more in a 2 to 4 hour window? Sure, but most people find that they don't. They may eat a 600 to 1000 calorie meal and then have a 200 to 400 calorie snack later totaling 800 to 1400 calories. Then they resume the fast.  Yeah, eat as healthily as you reasonably can. Don't eat junk food.  It helps to specifically NOT get any of your calories from what you drink. Stick to healthy food for calories.  The IF Wiki is here: https://reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/wiki/index
Thank you so much!! IF has blown my mind.    I began with 12-8:00pm for about 2weeks, then slowly shrank the window by opening my window later and later.   My goal quickly became to just hold the fast as long as I could. This means, I just wait to eat when I get home from work. So 5ish to 8ish is my typical window.  Sometimes longer, sometimes shorter.
"It works by stopping mindless decisions. I often ate out of boredom, habit or availability. The cookie jar at work that you pass every time you go into a meeting. Getting pizza delivered with colleagues, drinking a bottle of soda and snacking while gaming or watching TV... These are all things that are useless calories that don't make you feel full.  IF is an easy way to start being mindful about it because in the first half of your day you tell yourself ""nah, no cookies. I can have one in the afternoon though"" and you end up eating one in the afternoon and actually looking forward to it instead of the 5 you'd had otherwise and always felt bad about. After a while you might even realize that you don't even want that cookie anymore.  If you used to snack while watching TV, you need to find another way to keep your hands busy after 8 pm. After a while you start to transfer these habits into your eating window as well and find that you don't need the snacks while watching TV anymore.  And you start to relax and not go ravenous with the first sign of hunger. You learn to stick it out which makes you more relaxed and allows you to make healthier choices.  So all in all, IF is no magic solution. It is a great way to tackle your negative habits, though."
Hold me closer tiny denser
"Okay, so you guys are officially my heros üò≠ It's been hard for sure lol. I'm currently only watching my intake since I have a bad habit of rewarding working out with food, so the gym won't happen until I stick to the momentum I've found for a couple more months. As for things I noticed this month:  My bra is comfier lol, I can actually bend down without gasping like a dying fish, my skin doesn't hate me anymore, I sweat less (which is stunning), and honestly I'm feeling much more confident. I'm working towards and sticking with a goal, and I'm hoping hitting my goal weight next year will be my birthday present to me ‚ò∫ I can't bring this weight into my 30's, so it's now or never.  Edit: My bra is from Torrid! We live for Torrid bras in this household!  E2: Well kids, I guess the ole, ""not showing people I know"" thing is out the window üòÇ Thank you all for the support, some of my friends now know and are also mvp supporters üëç  E3: Girl it's not that deep. Am I standing farther from the mirror? Yes. Did I realize that when I took the pic? Nope. Am I trying to swindle you into thinking I'm smaller than I am? No, because karma doesn't pay my bills and only I have to live in this shell üòÇ But all the dms calling me hot, thank you good dudes! A compliment is a compliment!"
Good job. Every pound is one that you won‚Äôt see again. With your level of determination you can do this!
Hey, I hope you don‚Äôt find this weird, but I looked through your post history and as someone who also suffers from depression, I know firsthand that losing weight can relieve some of the mental stress we go through. It doesn‚Äôt cure it by any means (my depression actually started when I was at my lowest weight, and from there I started gaining). But weight loss has been proven to relieve some of the symptoms and help you feel better about yourself! Starting this journey is a big step for you, and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre taking the actions towards a healthier lifestyle and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre learning to love yourself. Life can suck but the best way to push through it is to say a big ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to life and prove you‚Äôre stronger than your depression. You‚Äôve got this!!! Show us what you‚Äôre made of, and keep on pushing!
Keep it up! I see some results!
Can deff see in the tummy area some change!!! You must post a 6 month update!!! Looking forward to seeing even more results! Rock on!!!
Excellent progress!! 22lbs in 30 days is amazing!
Nice work! Until you get back into the gym swing try a 30m-1hr walk while fasted. You don't need to get your heart rate up to burn fat and it'll help avoid that post-workout craving. Bonus points if it's on the beach or in a forest :)
30 days - it's a habit  90 days - it's a lifestyle   Keep up the great work. You've fine great so far
So true, just this little bit has changed my life this month! Thank you so much!
üò≠ God, I might love you. I'll say I've made some big moves since that post, and learned a few things about self love on the way. Some days are still just fighting to do anything, but between better nutrition, finding old hobbies I loved, and just sticking to a hygiene routine my life has been so much better. I'm just happy I didn't end it, we wouldn't have this comeback story!
That is some solid advice, I appreciate it!
Also friendly reminder to keep hydrated always. And sweet potato/yams are a great source of nutrients that give you a full feeling without much intake. Including that into my diet sped up the weight loss process for me. Keep up the great work!
The body has 3 sources of energy to draw upon: glucose in your blood stream, glycogen stored in your muscles, and fat stored around the muscles. When you fast, your body burns through the first 2 in succession. When they're depleted, it moves on to fat. So, when you do cardio while fasted your body is burning the fat instead of whatever meal you just ate. This is called Ketosis.  Problem is fat takes longer for the body to break down than glucose or glycogen, making long low to mid-intensity exercise like walking or hiking ideal.  I'm not an expert on this stuff by any means but that's my understanding after casually studying it for awhile.
Honestly, I just feel like the least I can do for the people being so kind to me is to be kind in return. Karma won't pay my bills, but being nice or telling people I appreciate the feedback is never a bad thing ‚ò∫
I wish I looked this good.  But I'm a 43 year old bald man
Wow! Congrats you loook great
Crushin‚Äô it girl!
Your ratio just went out of this world!
‚è≥
Girl you have an AMAZING figure! Congratulations!
Your fasting schedule please? If you can share few tips on what worked with you that will be great. In 8 months you did great. I am interested to learn what were few hacks that worked.
I‚Äôm a woman and I think this is the first time another woman has made me question if I‚Äôm straight or not.   10/10 I‚Äôm envious of your gorgeous body.
It's never too late
Thanks pal! I adore all of your cat posts, keep up the good work.
Extra thicc
I did mostly 16:8 and 20:4 with a lot of OMAD. I go on 30 minute walks pretty much everyday, sometimes they are jogs/runs. Even a little exercise everyday is a great step! Previously, I always tried to go too hard consistently and got burnt out of routines really quickly. Also cutting out sugary drinks was such a game changer. I pretty much only drink water and black coffee all day, and wow! I feel way less bloated and it really helped shed the weight off too.
Nope! Just daily cardio. I really want to start though, I just have to do my research and get past my gym anxiety.
My pleasure, my Grandson made this account for me today so I'm still not entirely sure what I'm doing.
You CAN do it. I'm going through something similar. Use this as your turning point. Chin up, push forward, nose to the grindstone and get to it. Set small goals and work towards them whether it be starting with 2lbs or 10lbs. Absolutely do not take failure as an option for yourself! You deserve to be happy in your own skin and you WILL get there! Keep us updated. Id say good luck but you don't need it. You got this.
Girl, this is honest and raw! Thank you for sharing this. YOU. GOT. THIS!!!
Don‚Äôt cry! Oftentimes we blindly put one foot in front of the other and fall into a rhythm. You just had your moment of clarity and decided to change directions, so props to you! You‚Äôll do great. And PS: you‚Äôre really pretty!
I‚Äôm in the exact same place actually. I looked my best in 2015, I even ran a half marathon. Since then I‚Äôve been eating, drinking and occasionally smoking.  I‚Äôm here to change it now. I‚Äôm with you, we can do this shit.
Thank you sooooo much. I needed that.
Any other moment I would probably be embarrassed to post something like this but it hit me hard and I felt this would make me realize how badly I need to make this change. Thank you :)
Check out everyone who is starting tomorrow because of you posting this
A similar situation happened to me! Last year on Father‚Äôs Day, a picture was taken of me, and when I saw it, I nearly threw up. I took some time to develop good habits, and now since then, I am down 106 pounds. You can do anything you set your mind to!
Girl you are GORGEOUS! I hope every time you see yourself you are proud of all the hard work you've put in.
Damn! I like how you have a big genuine smile in both pictures.  What worked best for you? By the way.. these are the posts we all strive to one day post, today is your day!  Great job.
Confidence level off the charts! For real, this is damn impressive.
Thank you so much! I amüòâ
Thank you! Cardio for 60 minutes a day and eating less worked for me along with IF of course. By eating less I mean eating the things I love but in moderate amounts and portions, not starving myself of the stuff I like to eat basically.
Wow! Way to go you, that‚Äôs awesome!
You‚Äôre half the woman you used to be!  Great work.
Do you mind sharing your IF regimen?
It‚Äôs crazy to put it in perspective how far you‚Äôve come if you imagine yourself now waking around but giving another present-you a piggy-back ride at all times. Congrats!
Intermittent fasting means you just don't eat for a short period of time, based on the massive changes in OP's pictures I can only assume she stopped eating in February 2018 and resumed eating in July 2019.
Sure.   Don‚Äôt fucking eat for 16 hours.   Do fucking eat for 8 hours.
https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/blebh5/left_2112018_315lbs_right_2112019_168lbs_todays/emod67i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app  From a previous thread where she shared results.
It really is crazy.  The math is even more-so.  Losing 1 pound requires a reduction of 3,500 calories.   160lbs lost is about 560,000 calories.  Over the span of 515 days she ate 1,087 calories less every day.  Goes to show people how much extra food an overweight person is actually eating to maintain or increase their size.
sometimes i like to go for a walk burning approx. 100 calories and then rewarding myself with a 2000 calorie treat
For some size comparison, in my before pic I‚Äôm wearing size 14 jeans, XL top and 36DDD bra. After pic is a size medium in top and pants, 32G bra. One of best pros of all this is going into any store now and finding my size! Dreams do come true lol
"Your before looks exactly like me. I'm 5' 6"" and 224. I got down to 194 last summer and packed it all on during some bad depression. I'm on meds now and am restricting eating to 8 hours a day. Now I just need to get in the mindset of healthier choices and some more exercise. Thanks for the inspirational pic!"
You look great
It just happened. I‚Äôve been doing lazyish 16:8 or occasional 20:4 and watching my calorie intake. My weakness is definitely my sweet tooth but even with that I was able to pass the plateau somehow.
Yes lol fair question, bras are confusing. Band size (the number) is relative to cup size (the letter). I went down in band size, but my boobs stayed relatively the same size so I needed a bigger cup. I probably wasn‚Äôt even wearing the correct size as a 36DDD though. Trust me I was shocked to get sized as a G too.
That's really amazing.  Your eyes grew too!   It's really crazy how much the geometry of a face can change. You have an awesome nose, and I'm normally not a nose-noticer.
You‚Äôre beautiful in both photos. But I could be easily convinced that these photos are not of the same person üôÇ!
Haha I work in a crowd that's very plastic-surgery friendly and I've had several coworkers ask if I got rhinoplasty, but I just got lucky.
Fam I am here for you. (I hate that expression as well)
Thank you! Started slowly in February (I left the country a bunch in February-May which messed me up), but really got my shirt together this summer and dropped 25 since end of July.
Cutting the snacks out was killer!!! I work red eye turns, so I normally go to work at 9 pm and end up eating around 11-12. I pack walnuts or cashews in case my food isn't quite enough, but I never eat on my second flight. I typically get a cafe con leche on the ground and then drink water on the flight back. I normally drink 2-3 liters a night. Then I sleep from 9-5, wake up and faff around or run, and do it again.   If I do a layover, I eat after service on the first flight and then nothing the rest of the night, hang out in the city the next day, day sleep, and eat right before I get ready for the red eye back (can you tell I'm a vampire?).  Mostly I try to wait until after first service to eat and then focus on drinking water for the rest of my duty day. I'm also five months sober which I think has helped tremendously with the weight loss.
That's forking amazing!
Holy mother forking shirtballs someone noticed. You are amazing.
How tall are you? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äô‚Äô and hit my heaviest at 213 lbs a couple years ago. Did low carb and unintentional IF (just stopped snacking after dinner) for 6 months and dropped 30 lbs but I‚Äôve fallen off the wagon and gained 15 back (because cake).   I haven‚Äôt been under 150 since middle school and it seems impossible. But I start back tomorrow morning. Gonna do 7am to 7pm for starters. Black coffee only too. Wish me luck!
Killing it! Keep it up bro
:-)

You looks so amazing! I bet you had fun shopping for a new wardrobe! Love the sweater and skirt combo!
Holy crap, just woke up and didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up! Thank you for the gold and silvers kind strangers!  Here‚Äôs a little more context since I know my post is a little vague. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 28.   I‚Äôve struggled with my weight all my life and was resigned to the fact that this was always going to be my life. In 2017 I reached my highest weight and with it came numerous health problems. I was on so many different medications for diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. (My blood work was back to normal after 6 months of changes and been off meds for over a year now.) This was the wake up call for me where I knew I had to make a change.   Instead of eating out / getting take out every day, I started making my own food and learning more about nutrition. I wish I can remember what I ate but the most important thing has been keeping tracking of calories and macros. CICO is key and knowing exactly how much food I‚Äôm eating  has really opened my eyes. I  also switch between intermittent fasting and OMAD since I find it‚Äôs easiest way not to over eat if I fast half of the day.   The working out and gym part came after I‚Äôve already lost some weight. I was doing some home workouts on YouTube and C25K. I remember the first time I stepped into the gym and I felt so awkward and out of place. I had no idea what to do and used the same five machines every day but I kept forcing myself to go back. Everyday is a process, the more I went the more I wanted to learn about lifting weights and adding more to my workouts.   I never did finish that C25K but that‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm not much of a runner. My current routine is I workout fasted for 1-2 hours, 5x a week. I‚Äôm focusing on my upper body as arms and back are my problem areas and add in cardio 2x a week. One of my goals is also to do a full pull up before the end of the year.   My first meal is usually around 2PM and I usually call this meal my post workout ‚Äúsnack‚Äù since I usually have a protein shake and some fruit or some chips. I also snack a bit until my last meal and my current favorite snacks are homemade pumpkin protein bread with chocolate hummus and cottage cheese. Protein is my best friend and it‚Äôs what keeps me full throughout the day. As for dinner, I always make sure I have a lot of vegetables since it helps keeping me full. If I‚Äôm craving something, I make it macro friendly and I eat rice most nights.   My point is, I don‚Äôt eat the healthiest food but I eat things in moderation and make them fit into my macros. If I know I‚Äôm going to be eating out (at least once a month), I make that my only meal of the day.  I started making changes in December 2017 and I don‚Äôt recognize the person I used to be anymore. It‚Äôs been a lot of hard work and I still have 10 lbs or so to lose but I‚Äôm so damn proud of how far I‚Äôve come.  Oh and [here‚Äôs doggo and I ](https://imgur.com/zVmx1Za)  üòã
Wow! You look so amazing! How tall are you, if you don't mind me asking?
What a weird comment.
what a weird comment.
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss
The first 100 took a little less than a year I think. The next 30 has been over the past 7-9 months but I haven‚Äôt been counting calories. The last 20 seem to be quite difficult. I mean I could be trying harder. :) I still do 20/4 most days of the month though.  *edit: Thanks for all the nice comments! I didn‚Äôt even realize I was wearing this particular shirt (a screenprinter friend of mine, who is actually a Trump supporter made it for me.) people are so easily triggered. Sheesh!   I will try and reply to some of those who have asked questions about the weight loss when I have more time.douchey  *edit #2: I really had no clue this post would get so much attention. Never again... so much anger out there.  So many people hated my ‚Äúdumb/douchey‚Äù after pic and horrible ‚ÄúAmerica hating‚Äù shirt and ‚Äúlame‚Äù hat... here‚Äôs a less or even more douchey one, you decide haha! It‚Äôs a little older and I was a bit heavier here.  https://i.imgur.com/afldmUd.jpg
You keep that shit up you magnificent bastard :)
Having a conjoined twin removed is cheating in my book
31 days?  WOW that‚Äôs some damn fine changes already!!  Show us next month and blow us away again!!!  BRAVO
Thank you so much for the nice comments it really means alot
I'm currently on about 3 weeks on my IF journey and I haven't had much success at all. But this makes me renew my commitment to myself and you have inspired to keep it up. Thank you and keep it up!
Keep on keeping on girl!!!! You‚Äôre looking WONDERFUL!
WOW!!! You look incredible!! Keep it up!!
I‚Äôve been thinking about starting and this has really motivated. It seems like it‚Äôs really difficult to commit to, but these results are pretty amazing.
it‚Äôs incredible! we‚Äôre all proud of you! keep up the good work!
Keep trying! I did 5 weeks of 16:8 and didn‚Äôt lose any weight. I threw in a few days of OMAD and started making my fasts different lengths each day and it really helped me see some progress. Try changing it up :)
[It gets easier.](https://youtu.be/R2_Mn-qRKjA)
Came across my old 5XL shirt and 4XL pants I used to wear when I was as high as 438 lbs in April of last year. It‚Äôs crazy seeing how these clothes that I would wear daily are now this big on me! Gave me a good reminder of how much progress I have made. Back then I would go to Walmart and buy 5-packs of plain white shirts in 5XL (largest they had) and ordered most my other clothes in bulk off amazon because almost no stores carried my size.   All I could wear were mainly different coloured plain shirts and shorts/sweatpants. And sometimes even those clothes would not fit and start to squeeze on me so I‚Äôd have to give them a big stretch before I put them on to make sure they fit fine. I was never even able to wear jeans before I started losing weight. I always loved the idea of wearing nice fashionable clothes but often struggled find anything in my size.   I can‚Äôt count how many times I remember the feeling of going in a fitting room and praying what I‚Äôm about to wear would just fit, only to be let down. Now that I can actually go ahead and wear that pair of jeans or shirt that I couldn‚Äôt before... it‚Äôs a proud feeling. Having the privilege of being able to walk into any store and find my size, or put on a shirt without being scared it won‚Äôt fit is one of the several reasons I am greatful for this weight loss and eager to keep going for these last ~ 10 pounds left to lose!   Truly appreciate all the support you all show.  If anyone would like to keep up with me, wants advice/tips, or to know more about my journey, I‚Äôm on all social medias under [@omarthaherfit](https://instagram.com/omarthaherfit?igshid=88uty43cuzss). Though, I am mainly active on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/omarthaherfit?igshid=88uty43cuzss). You can also subscribe to my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8vY3biAoqxxQkEj_E06vpQ ) if you‚Äôd like as I will be releasing my first upload by next week! Along with my full transformation video, loose skin video, and lots of other content on there very very soon. Thanks for reading! üôèüòä  EDIT: Although this whole journey has been a constant battle, the past couple days have really been extra challenging both physically and mentally but I still keep fighting. Seeing the support i get from you all and the positive impact i am able to make is indescribable... feels beyond amazing. I feel so grateful and want you to all know the support and love you show is never taken for granted. I will never stop pushing boundaries and will do as much as I possibly can to be an example of the potential we all have in us. Thank you all, nothing but love and gratitude. ‚ù§Ô∏è  EDIT 2: I am getting a lot of questions on how I did it, what my diet was etc. and want you all to know I will be answering these questions along with several others in detail on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8vY3biAoqxxQkEj_E06vpQ) channel.

That‚Äôs insane bro.  Good work
Holy f**k ! That‚Äôs just crazy transformation. No chance to recognize two people as the same guy without the caption. Respect!
Well done but you should really rethink that chinstrap after all the amazing work you've put in to reacquire a chin.
This is probably one of the most significant changes I‚Äôve see. Good job  With that ethic I assume your gonna be built like a lifeguard in two weeks
One thing that hasn‚Äôt changed between now and when I started my weight loss journey is that face I make trying to squeeze in those last few reps haha. Another thing though is my work ethic and persistence. Through all the success and failure I encounter throughout my journey I always try my best to move forward and keep grinding.  Lost more weight or progressed faster than you were expecting one week? Great! Let‚Äôs keep working. Gained weight or fell off track on your diet and/or exercise? That‚Äôs alright. It happens. Get back up and keep working. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with rewarding yourself when you‚Äôre doing good or better than expected, but don‚Äôt let rewarding yourself turn into making bad decisions that may set you back since you are ahead or feel you deserve it.  Same goes for when you aren‚Äôt doing so great. Don‚Äôt let that turn into more poor choices but rather let it give you more purpose to get back on track and stay focused. Easier said than done but those are 2 things that you will definitely want to follow to stay on the right path in the long run. üëç  If anyone would like follow my journey or know more about me, my Instagram is @omarthaherfit (https://instagram.com/omarthaherfit?igshid=88uty43cuzss), that is my main social media I use to update everyone on my progress and offer as much value, knowledge, and motivation I can to whoever needs it. üôÇüôè  Also, for anyone curious about my current diet/eating habits; Intermittent fasting/OMAD (One Meal A Day) on a High Protein Low Carb dietary plan is what I follow. After experimenting, that is what works best for me and I can see myself doing for however long I choose to. Im pretty basic when it comes to eating when im eating at home. A meat source is key, usually chicken, if not beef, turkey, etc. to get a good amount of protein, along with some rice and/or salad/veggies to get greens in; kale chips are amazing! A protein bar/shake, granola bar, protein ice cream, nuts are some other foods i eat frequently to get enough protein and fibre in!
Aha appreciate u thanks! üòÖ
Shut up Carol
Hi everyone! Here‚Äôs what I have done/am doing:  Age 26 F Height: 5‚Äô7 SW: 235  CW: 173  plz note: I am not a nutritionist or medical expert  This photo on the left is from the end of Sept 2018 and the photo on the right is from this morning. I started fasting end of sept 2018 and did 16:8 fasting. I did this for about a month. I then switched to 23:1 Keto OMAD and this is where I lost a majority of my weight. I am now back to 16:8 most days and am eating clean. Fruits, veggies, and proteins. I stay low carb right now, but not necessarily Keto! Some days I will still do OMAD if I didn‚Äôt do a very intense workout.  OMAD meals were/are between 800-1200 calories. As far as what my Keto meals were, I would just google what I wanted and how to make it Keto. Literally as simple as that.   I workout once a day (sometimes twice if I‚Äôm bored or done with school). I do CrossFit 4-5 days a week and then cardio such as walking or elliptical on top of that or other than that. Any questions feel free to ask. Thank you all again for your support along the way. I can‚Äôt begin to explain how great I feel.   As far as the stretch marks, I think the majority of the fading just has to do with the weight loss. I use a daily moisturizer and rosehip oil, but I always have and have never seen much of a difference until I lost weight. They are still there! Just extremely faded. As far as the ‚Äúwhere is your loose skin?‚Äù Comments, not everyone has loose skin after losing weight! I lost a normal amount each week and also exercised a ton.. everyone‚Äôs body and skin is very different.   Insta: ‚Äútaytoeee‚Äù There are videos and such on my insta, shows that none of this is photoshopped. Also, if you are creepy there or here you will be blocked.   How did I stay motivated? I was tired of being fat and lazy. I looked at photos of myself overweight. I wanted to wear normal clothes and be comfortable. I reminded myself of my goals each and every single day. Easier said than done, but I powered through until I met each goal. 
üò±üò±üò± please share what you did and if youre comfortable how you feel about loose skin on your stomach if you have any? I literally gasped seeing this!!
I truly thought you were trolling us until I noticed you have distinct ears and the ears are still the same. You really look like two different people. That is so inspiring. 
"I would have lost money if you asked me to bet on what your weight is at 5'7"" for the pic on the right. Thought you were 145 max. You have good genetics for weight distribution!"
Me too! I can‚Äôt believe how awesome your tummy looks! Do you have any loose skin/apron anymore? Like, under your undies? This gives me so much hope that I could actually get rid of the rest of my tummy. You look AMAZING 
Not op but I‚Äôve never read a compliment that felt so weirdly good. Idk but good generics for weight distribution is the strangest yet most satisfying compliment hahaha, she really does, also I think she probably built some muscle! 
no loose skin but just some left over chub I am trying to get rid of!   Edit: for those who keep saying I have skin tucked in or edited this.. go on my Instagram. I have videos up of my body and you can‚Äôt edit a video lol. I have no reason to be dishonest on here. Everyone‚Äôs skin is different and clearly mine just bounced back well!
Yes lots of muscle. Thank you! They are my pride and joy haha
They‚Äôre still there, just faded. 
You look so much happier and confident.
Amazing! You are an inspiration! Do you have a link to the podcast?
It was a scary time. I was shut in and depressed. I'm just happy to be here üòÅ
Ohh my bad I forgot to put it sorry!  https://anchor.fm/thefastking/episodes/I-aint-dying-yet-MFs-e4qtf6
"My brother is a professional Barber and homie don't play that. He said if I'm gonna be back it in public I'm not allowed to look like a ""homeless Yogi Bear"""
I am thinking just breathing is easier.
I have a CPAP machine that absolutely saved my life. Ive had inhalers all my life and for the first time ever this year I haven't needed even one
Ohh Lord no! Intermittent fasting I should have clarified I apologize. I do two 48 hour fast a week and drink nothing but water
Just a friendly piece of advice. Still keep one with you/accessible.  You never know when asthma will flair up. It might be years but it can still become a problem. My brother passed away from an asthma attack after not having a serious one for over 10 years. Only very minor ones. Take care man. Great job!
I know I gotta get one just in case. Asthma is NO JOKE. I'm really sorry about your brother, that must have been hard
You became....a completely different person.
You look AMAZING. Our stats are similar and my goal is 130. Can I ask how long did it take? And how you did it? Thanks!
Hey guys! I‚Äôm just going to write this instead of replying to every single comment‚Äî  Height- 5‚Äô2‚Äù  I do omad most days but what really made me lose the weight was being in a caloric deficit. It doesn‚Äôt matter what time of the day you eat what, it just matters about how many calories you‚Äôre taking in.   Eating all of my food at once just helped me feel more satisfied rather than eating smaller meals through out the day. Figure out what works best for you! :)  3500 calories=1pound  So if you‚Äôre in a 500 calorie deficit every day you will lose weight.   This took me a little over a year and I had many cheat days in between because I like to have fun, and it helped me stay sane!    As for people saying that the fake tan is what is making me look smaller... what ever. I think it would still be pretty obvious fake tan or not if I was still 180 pounds. üñï
I started back in April last year so a little over a year!! I try to do omad 6 days a week and just drink water for the remaining day. I had many many cheats while I was doing this so that‚Äôs why it took a little longer, but I was happier doing it the slower way :)
Mate you have ballooned in size from the first photo... you need to stop this immediately! ...     All jokes aside well done you're killing it
TLDR:  14 days water fast followed by 5 days keto IF 16-8 1500 calories  Repeat until satisfied   Racquetball and worked up to running & basketball as weight loss permitted (knees)  During water fast, took pink salt, lyteshow, etc for electrolytes and noticed a difference when didn‚Äôt.   [https://youtu.be/fr-lDXuswgk](https://youtu.be/fr-lDXuswgk)  for more info  Edit: added electrolyte info 
Wow you look 10 years younger and have probably added 20 years to your life. Well done!!  Oh and you should post an after picture in the same suit, just for giggles.
Do me a favor and tell everyone who says you‚Äôre doing this in an unhealthy manner to fuck off. 
Exactly!  People give me shit for fasting and I always point out Im still getting my calories, its just coming from my gut!
His body went to starvation mode :'(  F 
Nailed it!! 
I wish I still had that suit! I donated 12 suits and about 30 shirts/suits/pants etc to Goodwill. Losing weight had the surprising side effect of needing an entirely new wardrobe üòÇ
This comment encapsulates what I constantly have to deal with. ‚ÄúWhy are you starving yourself??‚Äù  If you have fat on your body, you have food so scientifically speaking I am NOT starving. The average person ~150lbs has ~70,000 calories of fat. Nobody starving here!!
I went close to zero carb about a year ago.  Once my body became adjusted to using fat as energy i found that fasting was easy cuz i quickly convert over to burning my own fat.  Theres no hunger pains. When your burning your own fat you get like this acuity of senses that feels incredible.  I actually look forward to fasting.  I never thought Id say that.
I say I'm not starving, I'm just eating Taco Bell cira 2004 while jiggling my thigh fat at them. But I'm a ridiculous human being so it works well for me.
Check nih.gov, and you‚Äôll find research and definitions of research criteria.  For me, I found nothing regarding ‚Äústarvation mode‚Äù.  The only risk I‚Äôve found is mineral depletion, which can lead to cardiac events (refeeding syndrome).    That depends on what someone means by water fast (true water, vs low calorie fluids, vs mineral supplements.  OP takes electrolytes/minerals during 14d WF, and keto 5d, then repeats.).  The study that said a guy fasted for 400 days even had clarification that he ate nutritive yeast and took mineral suppliments.  But, we‚Äôre all just voices on Reddit.  Trust peer reviewed science that you verify on your own, not us.
Fuck bro you killed it.
Thanks man. Honestly can say I‚Äôve been busting ass in the weight room. Can‚Äôt wait to see what another year does.
Hey thanks man. And hell yeah I feel like a totally different person. Girls just come up to me now and it‚Äôs awesome lol
Hey pal, looks like you just need to hit the weight room. I know guys are 65-70 and they still looked jacked because they just stayed loyal to lifting at least 3 times a week.  PM me and let‚Äôs figure out your height, weight, work lifestyle and maybe I can help you with a workout and diet program. Totally free.
I‚Äôve already achieved what I wanted to. It‚Äôs just a lifestyle now and  my new goals are just to get stronger.
Left photo is at 112kg in Nov 18 directly after I had our first child, our baby boy (includes weight of baby, I weighed before delivery üë∂). The black dress was tight and I was very heavy and uncomfortable. I‚Äôm an apple shape so all those extra pounds went straight to my tummy, waist and hips. https://imgur.com/wqzHnJo  After switching to fully formula (sadly - although formula feeding can be pretty awesome) I started incorporating some fasting Dec 2018. I‚Äôm now down to 74kg and hoping to lose another 5 or more if I can before the day.   That‚Äôs a total loss of 38kg or 83lb. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù btw. I have lost at least 4 sizes - everything I bought became stretch stuff so I have no real clue!   I didn‚Äôt exercise - just restrict, fast and daily pram walks.  My little boy is delightful, chubby, a great sleeper and I‚Äôm loving mum life! The wedding is just the icing on the cake right now :)  Edit: thanks everyone for your amazing comments. I don‚Äôt often feel pretty - it‚Äôs made my day to see how much everyone likes the  dress and my efforts! Put a smile on my face :)
^(Or just start using fucking kilograms. Jesus, fucking Americans.)
How many football fields is a kg?
thanks so much everyone! in response to questions about what i do: i tend to eat one small to medium sized meal a day, usually dinner, bc that‚Äôs just when my body is hungry. sometimes i will also have a small snack during the day if i start feeling bad. i‚Äôve also done longer fasts before, my longest was 108 hours with just water & cigarettes. unfortunately, recently i‚Äôve fallen off track and been binging quite a bit, but i‚Äôm hoping being here might help me get back on track! thank you so much for all your kind words!
wait shit that‚Äôs a bot i‚Äôm a fool lmao

Hey man, I'm sitting at 630 and just want you to know this is my inspiration to try today. Thanks for posting.
First of all, dont you know that fasting doesn't work! You've clearly lost ALL of your muscle mass.
Ok bro-awesome...tell us what you did to get there. What was your routines like? How long did it take?  Amazing job!
You have no idea how much that means to me to hear that! Thanks, you just made my day. Anything is possible my friend. One day at a time. One small choice at a time. üôèüí™
I lost the weight over the course of a year and a half... But it's taken me another year to pack on the muscle. Typical IF routine of fasting for 16 hrs and have 8 hr eating window. I usually eat two large meals per day. I train 5-6 days per week and focus primarily on resistance training. Very little cardio.
Both of you guys get at it!!!!  It won‚Äôt be instantaneous, but get at it and drop some weight....looking forward to your posts in the future about your progress!!!
Finally someone posts on this sub and actually helps others and answers questions! Thank you dude! You're looking great! Keep up the work.
"Long time lurker, first time poster :)  It started with quitting drinking which was a big step for me. I noticed the weight dropping which inspired me to learn and attempt a ""healthy"" lifestyle.   I firstly tried eating ""healthy foods"", then a keto diet using exogenous ketones but I still struggled to ditch the sugar cravings and would cave at the end of the day. It is intermittent fasting which works for me long term. I wont eat until 1 or 2pm and that makes it a lot easier to consume fewer calories. It also means I don't feel bad if I do occasionally treat myself to sugary goodness.  The first year I didn't do any exercise, then I decided to add it to the mix to gain some muscle and fitness (and I now LOVE it).  My journey started 3.5 years ago (still sober living woohoo!) and I've maintained the ""after pic"" body for this time by continuing to eat within a window of time and experimenting with different foods to find which do and don't work with my body.   I hope this may inspire some of you to keep at it, it DOES get easy and soon it will just become your normal :)"
DAMN SIS
Damn you went from Rebel Wilson to Carmen Electra.
The boobs and the tan are not real!  The weight loss is though! Haha.   I lost all the weight and felt like an 8yr old boy in a bikini so after a long debate I figured why not reward myself with some extra bits. I know it's not for everyone and I may receive judgement for it, but it has helped my confidence and I've experienced no negative side effects so I am happy :)
Awesome to see this kind of mindset to better yourself and commitment so young....I didn't get my shit together till 30 lol. Put this mindset to everything you do and you will do great things bud!
Good job man, just keep in mind at 15 you‚Äôre still growing up so you‚Äôll need good nutrition to build up your body
Thanks! I've been trying to lose weight since the start of the year but I 'discovered' fasting around March and although I've had a few ups and downs it really has been amazing and changed my life for the better.
Look at all that zero carb spaghetti from the sky!
Weird flex but ok
This is the funniest thing that I‚Äôve seen all week.  Classic! 
Yeah, get a load of this dude over here with *showers* and *running water* :D
I wish this concept worked for me I always end up buying all the rewards either way
This is a cool idea. I basically quit smoking this way. Every day I didn't buy cigarettes, I put the 5 bucks I didn't spend on cigarettes into a savings account and then bought a TV when it got high enough.
You have nice handwriting.
I think this is great! The only thing is you may want to get the tattoo when you are at a lower weight. Getting a tattoo, and then dropping another 70 pounds or so, is going to warp the artwork. Just my 2 cents :-)
Luckily I‚Äôm broke, so I‚Äôll only be able to afford the rewards as I earn them anyway üòÇ
The tattoo is just going on my wrist, so I don‚Äôt think losing weight will affect it really :) if I decide to get any more, I‚Äôll for sure wait until I‚Äôm closer to my goal, though!
Plus you save money on the food part of the budget.
But you spend it on buying smaller clothing, and warmer clothing because suddenly winter actually becomes cold now that the insulation is gone.
HIIT. Sprint on treadmill. Lift. Sprint more. Lift. Sprint again. Lift sleeeeeeep
Started 16:8. After  a month 18:6. After another month 20:4. Keto just low carbs barely any. Lots of protein and cheese / avocados 
I can‚Äôt believe myself,  Reddit helped. other people motivated me and I just wanted to do better 
If I didn't already know about IF, I would swear you were faking that this was accomplished in only 40 days. Wow!  Edit: I meant 4 months, not 40 days. Still unbelievable!
Dude, you are the uberly godily fucking man.  Wow, trazillion respects.  Yes, those are valid words
Sleep is the most important! I should know, I‚Äôm a professional (sleeper).
Seriously, 4 months and you still haven‚Äôt made your bed?
What a shape! Thanks for the inspiration!
"Oh my Lord, I wish I looked as good as you do at 155, and only 5'4""!"
natural law of entropy at its finest üòî  disclaimer: I was waiting for this comment hahaha
haha thank you but don‚Äôt be fooled, I lose weight practically everywhere except my butt and thighs... behind this photo is an even bigger behind (pun intended).
We see this as a feature, not a bug.
It really is insane how much of our daily lives revolve around food. I‚Äôve been doing alternate day fasting for a while now and I was annoyed the other day because my husband wanted to go see a movie but it was on a fasting day. I had this overwhelming need to HAVE to get popcorn at the theater because that‚Äôs normal, right? (Eye roll). I‚Äôm proud to say I didn‚Äôt give in! Breaking those food/social event attachments is tough but so worth it!!! 
Just for some background- my last long water fast was last September and I lasted 14 days. I‚Äôm going back to Italy to visit my LDR boyfriend at the end of the month and want the total clarity that comes along with doing a water fast so I‚Äôm thinking now is a great time to do my second long term fast!

This must be one of the most impressive success stories I have read about. The photos show such a tremendous difference and speak volumes.  I imagine that many individuals in the 300+ range feel they are doomed but your story has to be like a beacon of hope.  Full time working, student too and an LDR - mastering fasting on the side while losing 150 lbs.  You lost all that weight and will be even ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù but without doubt there is a giant in you for life.  Sincere congratulations!
This is amazing! Congratulations! I just posted today about how I‚Äôve lost 106 lbs. Can‚Äôt wait to hit 150 down! Keep being awesome!
I can‚Äôt even count how many times I tried and didn‚Äôt succeed- just keep putting in the effort and I promise you that one time it will stick!
"Hey! A few tips for you if you've never water fast before.   1. Like everything, fasting gets better with practice. The first few times will feel hard but your body will adjust with time.  2. Hunger comes and goes in wave. Many people think hunger just gets worse and worse until you finally eat, but it's not the reality. If you learn to ""ride out"" the wave, you'll find hunger subsides after a while.  3. The hardest part is not physical hunger, but it's definitely cravings, or emotional hunger. Keep your mind busy and don't let it ""talk you out"" of your fast. You'll 100% always regret it. 4. Listen to your body. Being hungry is normal, but being light-headed or nauseous is not. It could be that you have an electrolytes imbalance, in which case you can put some salt and potassium in your water and see if it helps. But if not, don't play with your health. You can always resume your fast on another day. 5. Welcome to fasting and good luck!"
That‚Äôs *Venti* water macchiato to you buster
r/waterniggas would like a word with you
First time doing an extended water fast, although I've done several juice fasts.   Lifted weights 10x throughout (hit 60% of the weight I usually do) and hot yoga 3x. While I'm not performing at the same level as usual with weight training, I have way more motivation to workout--prior to the fast I hadn't worked out in over a month.   The 2nd through 4th day were really hard and I almost quit many times but pushed through. Now it's easy, only hard part is the psychological/emotional hunger--there's no physical sensation associated, no hunger pangs.   Not a pure water fast, I had bone broth 5x, avocado 4x and heavy cream in my coffee a few times. I recommend Dr. Fungs book on fasting. He says cream and bone broth are fine and you get virtually all the same benefits as a pure water fast.   I'm so happy with the results, I feel amazing and am in a constant state of mild euphoria. I plan on continuing until I reach my goal, 30-40 pounds lost (at a little over 25 now)
That‚Äôs amazing!  How tall are you?  I started at 189lbs on Friday, today weighed in at 182.3lbs.  41F, 5‚Äô7‚Äù. I want to lose around 40lbs.  I was thinking of starting a discord chat room for extended fasters.
"Aw thank you!! And good job!!! You got through the hard part-the 2nd/3rd day AND the weekend. It's down hill from here.   Discord chat would be awesome! Keep me posted on whether you do, I'd join.   I'm 5'8. Just got out of the ""overweight"" category for BMI today :D"
I posted once on here about how to stop myself feeling guilty if I break a fast earlier than planned.  I was expecting support and reassurance, all I got was people acting as if it was a sin - trying to give me advice on how not to break early, how to power through the headaches/dizziness/nausea instead of actually.  This in turn made me feel like breaking fast early is a failure, that I could do nothing worse.    ‚ÄúYou should just drink more coffee‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your time to eat‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just your old habits breaking through‚Äù  BULLSHIT. If you‚Äôre doing this, and you occasionally have a time where you break earlier than planned, then you do you.  If you are sticking to it 99%, 80%, 75% or whatever else then that is your decision to make.  If you are making positive changes in your life, no matter how small, they are a step in the right direction.  Things like breaking early or allowing yourself shouldn‚Äôt be looked down upon, they should be encouraged - you are the one trying to regain control, and if that is you controlling yourself in your own way then good on you.
I have always wondered where the line was drawn in this regard.
While the good outweighs the bad, I definitely agree that we shouldnt encourage eating disorders. I remember the post you‚Äôre talking about, and I remember thinking she looked very skinny to be fasting. As a community, I think we all need to be more conscious about what we‚Äôre encouraging. Thank you for making this post, but I think that, overall, this sub is very inspiring and helpful. I hope we can continue to cultivate the positive aspects of this community!
Even if someone is currently overweight or obese they can still develop an eating disorder and/or body dysmorphia.  While the article below may be focused on teens, it applies to anyone and this quote pretty much sums it up: ‚ÄúTaken too far, the anti-obesity movement can mean focusing on thin versus fat, instead of healthy versus unhealthy, which can trigger disordered eating behaviors‚Äù.  The primary concern I have with these extended fasts is that people are pushing themselves to unhealthy points as OP mentioned. The focus is on weight loss and not health which is dangerous. Also, the amount of support, praise and upvotes is very rewarding and can encourage dangerous behaviors or even escalate them.   In addition, when extended fasts are completed people often see weight gained back once they return to their normal eating patterns which can cause feelings of guilt, shame and failure which can trigger disordered eating behaviors.  It‚Äôs been amazing to see so much progress, so many successes stories and see so much support but this sub does walk a dangerous line between healthy and dangerous behaviors.  Please stay safe.   [A pretty interesting article on the topic](https://www.today.com/health/200-pound-anorexic-obese-teens-risk-disorder-its-often-unrecognized-4B11216388)
I agree with you
I think this is very important to remember because there absolutely is a difference between fasting and anorexia and it is our responsibility as a collective to consistently keep that line defined through our actions and what we encourage.
Thank you. I‚Äôve been called a lot of names both in and out of the PMs for this and it‚Äôs really starting to make me feel like I‚Äôm a lunatic. I might have eating problems, but I‚Äôm not blind, nor uneducated, nor insane.  I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre all anorexic this is just me saying some of the posts on here are getting out of hand.
Obese people can be anorexic, just FYI. It's a mental illness characterised not just by weight but obsessive thinking and routines, and excessive guilt about food. Just because they aren't in immediate danger of starvation doesn't mean the mental effects are any easier to live with.
I don't think that how you personally feel is a good metric though, because of how eating disorders work. If you develop an eating disorder, it warps your perception of what and when you should eat. That's what makes eating disorder so insidious: the disordered person thinks that what they're doing is good, that it's helping them.
Congratulations! You look happy and healthy!
Look at those killer legs! Way to go!
Over the last year I‚Äôve been working on losing weight mostly by just watching my calories and doing some intermittent fasting as well.   Mostly just posting this for personally accountability since I‚Äôve been slacking a bit too much lately.
Fuckin A. Get a haircut, a tight fade, get lifting and you'll be king of the chads in no time
