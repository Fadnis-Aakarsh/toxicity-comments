Willie is a studüëçüíØ
This is the only father I've ever known of to be happy that his daughter has a little Willie inside of her.
Willie is the man
Didn‚Äôt realize it was written on the actual truck at first, thought the imaged was modified. 
Willie hears you,   Willie cares
Looks like willie has open invitation to dinner for life 
Everyone please I beg of you to become a donor. I did immediately when I got my license because of my dad getting a new liver from a motorcycle rider who was also a donor.
Willie is a good human being. 
This is the nicest thing I have ever seen on the back of a truck!
I drive past this truck on my way to work every day! I remember seeing this plea for his daughter‚Äôs health for about two straight years. I‚Äôm glad she finally got what she needed! Thanks, Willie! Pittsburgh appreciates you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Willie is my dream man üòçüò´üòç
That went a bit too far, dad.
He willie cares. 
I wish we would make it an opt-out system instead.  So many people dont have any objections but are just too lazy to check a checkbox.  People who have religious objections or whatever can still opt out, but make donating organs when someone dies the default option.
My name is Willy if that's close enough for you üòèüòúüòòü§£
OwO please take my willy
Username checks out
Little blurbs like this are the reason why I reddit. 
With that username you sure it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù?
Yes officer, this post right here.
We‚Äôre very loud people, there was no way to misunderstand us üòÇ
"I didnt know it until a friend became in need but living donors of livers is thing. Recipients insurance pays the donors fees, 4"" incision, 40% is removed (two blood vessels feeding two halfs), it grows back to like 85% in less than 90 days. Amazing things they can do.   Was (might still be if she needs) on standby for this. Week in the hospital, couple at home, could work on my laptop during recovery. Living donors are better matched up/tested/donated fresher. "
Well, Willie doesn't.
Bleat me to it
u/lostinhoppers  Mike, you're a good dude. Just wanted to let you know mate.  Edit: guys I appreciate the gold but toss it Mike's way instead of to me, please! He's the one who deserves it. I'm just a guy hoping to let him know he's appreciated.
"I've called lifeline before about being abused. They literally told me to ""cheer up"" while my alcoholic mother was screaming and trying to beat down my bedroom door.  Guys, use BeyondBlue. They're so much better.  EDIT: Just in case anyone gets worried, I'm all good now. This was a few years ago."
I worked for a crisis line and we had pseudonyms before we ever took a call for this exact reason. It‚Äôs not hard to make up a name and it‚Äôs a small thing to do to make someone feel comfortable. 
Hey. You there. The one reading this comment.  If you ever need someone to talk to, please come make a post in r/PleaseCallMe  Talk, text, chat on Reddit, whatever.  Lots of good people over there willing to spend some time with you.  
u/lostinhoppers    Jazakhallah Khair my friend. 
I worked on a peer counseling helpline in school and would just like to point out to anyone who is interested that there actually *is* a reason you should not give your name to a caller. Put simply, the phone is an inappropriate place for there to be too intense of a bidirectional relationship. If there is, the caller could easily become dependent on the specific counselor they call. This leads to issues of staffing and timing of course, but more importantly, the caller could begin moving out of scope of what over-the-phone counseling can assist with. By sharing personal information with our callers, counselors may end up creating a relationship with them that would discourage the caller from seeing professionals who are far more effective with in-person therapy, thereby ultimately doing more harm than good.  Basically, our psychologist-director used to tell us that the last thing you want as an over the phone counselor is to have the same person *call you specifically* every time they wanted to harm themselves; it's not easily solvable and you will be ultimately burdened beyond your capability. It's best for people in that situation to make standing appointments with a therapist who can teach them skills and take advantage of face to face rapport. Phone calls don't have the same effectiveness, so they are best used for venting occasional frustrations and difficulties on an anonymous basis.   What's more, the Pavlovian learning mechanism could lead to that caller being unable to unlearn the link between feelings of suicide and just talking to one specific guy or girl. They need a bigger toolbox than that.  Plus, there's legal stuff (caller kills themselves and evidence suggests that they've spoken to person Y every single day including at the time they kill themselves; Y couldn't save them; how do you prove Y was not responsible?)
This is way too amazing. Nice to know someone cares when you are down and out. Kudos to Michael. 
https://old.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/ae8ubx/i_just_called_lifeline_australia/  Thanks Mike!
He's done this before too.  https://i.imgur.com/xDvNzav.png
I knew all along
He‚Äôs a 50 year old nurse according to himself. He just lost a ton of weight and posted update pics as we. Kudos Micheal. Saving lives and leading by example!
"I'm in the USA, and I called the National suicide hotline only once. I was going through a lot, and as I was telling the guy that I just wanted to die because of the abuse he said, ""well, have you tried changing your attitude?"" I immediately hung up on him. It pissed me off so much.   I am still alive, but later that night I did attempt suicide. I sometimes wonder if I had gotten someone else if I'd never have attempted it. But that's in my past now, I have the future to look forward to."
Suicide Callback Service is pretty good to.
Wow, how disappointing of lifeline. Glad you‚Äôre good now. 
I am guessing the kids help line is a different number but I can vouch for them if any youngin here is seeking a friendly person to chat to. Nearly 20 years ago shitty teenage me prank called kids help line and pretended to be pregnant or something and despite all the giggling and bullshit the person on the line was AMAZING. Friendly, encouraging and saw right through my bullshit, she made sure I was truly ok and let me know that they are always there for me. I wish I was as awesome as the people who handle those calls, takes someone truly special.
Same! We were told to pick a fake name we could remember so they could still track if someone was looking for a specific person to talk to but we were still allowed to go give that fake name. I think some people just find it easier to talk to someone if they have a name, it‚Äôs hard to open up to a stranger. 
Isnt not hanging up kind of a big deal or requirement as well?
This is just the sub I‚Äôve been looking for thank you
Oh fuck this dude just cast a spell on you dude. Run Mike!
r/Izlam appreciates the goodwill. Tashakur, u/lostinhoppers  Edit: why do I have gold I‚Äôm a second rate Muslim who only knows like three surahs and has trouble with Pashto at 16, fucking hell
Perhaps a system-wide nickname could be used.  Think something like nurses and cops on Pokemon.  All of the nurses are Nurse Joy and all of the police officers are Officer Jenny.  A system like this would avoid sharing personal information and avoid individual connection, but still provide callers a name to refer to.  
At Samaritans (in the UK) everyone gives their name as Jo. Still personal, gender neutral, and you can't ask for the same person because they wouldn't know which one to give you. 
Interesting point. I had not considered that. However, I can‚Äôt imagine a WORSE way to approach this challenge than hanging up on the caller.
Holy shit can we get a petition for Mike becoming Australian of the year?
What a fuckin great human being
And you can too.  Just hop on to r/depression or r/suicidewatch and try to find and help people who got no or bad response. 
On it  Edit: did what I could, hope you‚Äôre keeping up the keto, Mike!
The issue is that there are two types of workers on those lines. Trained professionals and volunteers.
"Aw so sorry you encountered such bullshit. The first time I opened up to a student psychologist about my anxiety she said ""whoa that's no way to live!"". Took me years to even try and find a therapist again. Often wondered how life would've gone if I had a good therapist right away.   Don't be afraid to shop around for help. There are really good therapists/programs out there. "
The name makes it sound like a service where they will return your incoming calls after you've killed yourself... am I the only one who gets that feeling from the name?!
The post above says they don‚Äôt do this specifically to avoid having callers ask for a specific person. Where are you from?
We only hang up under certain circumstances. When callers are threatening or verbally abusing a counselor, for example. There were other situations where we wouldn‚Äôt hang up but would firmly end the call. There were 30 or so ‚Äúregular‚Äù callers who we would hear from every few days or every few hours. We had these people on a binder so that new counselors would have a better understanding of their situations and how to speak with them. Sometimes we had a name and other times we could figure out by how they spoke. Anyway, some of the very frequent callers were restricted on how many calls per day. We were a small center serving a large area with only so many people to keep it staffed 24 hours a day. Others were banned, temporarily or permanently for verbally abusing a counselor in the past.   Anyway, yeah. We try not to hang up. But sometimes we had to. 
To maintain healthy boundaries in a therapeutic relationship. It‚Äôs about the caller, not any personal info about you. So we used the pseudonym, don‚Äôt share personal experiences or opinions, etc. It was all about reflective listening, unconditional positive regard, and helping people sort through their thoughts and feelings to see what can be done to fix that pain/fear/etc. Aside from that, I have a really uncommon name and that would have made me more easily identifiable than others. 
nah he just said thank you in arabic 
be a humanist. It feels nice and seems to help sometimes.
Yeah, why not call everyone John and Jane? 
You guys should make him prime minister! It seems that eveyone gets to try that out, I am sure Mike would do just as good! 
My middle name is Michael.
Fucking top bloke
But doctor... I *am* Pagliacci
Just...be prepared to deal with talking to people who have issues. I tried to talk to someone on r/suicidewatch. I was depressed myself and thought maybe helping someone else would make me feel better somehow.   He had me 100% convinced he was committing suicide as we talked. I contacted mods for advice and they explained that there was little they could do, blah, blah, yada, yada. He said ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù and I went to bed that night convinced he was dead. I checked his profile incessantly the next few days and he was casually commmenting on various topics. I PM‚Äôd him to say I wished he‚Äôd told me he was ok (I did NOT try to guilt trip him in ANY way, just said I wished he‚Äôd told me he was alive) and he basically blew me off. I understand why, but I just can‚Äôt deal with that kind of emotional roller coaster so I don‚Äôt reply to posts on those subs anymore. 
There can also be trained volunteers but professionals who just phone it in. We'll never know though. Regardless, professional or not, some of them have never gone through serious depression and suicidal ideation. But for those who have, and are really trying to help and reach out, they know the right words to ask, and much more better if they're trained. 
My therapist told me that a good way to cope with my infant daughter dying and needing to be resuscitated in front of me (she lived!) was to ‚Äúrecord her laughter just in case she dies for real‚Äù  Some therapists just should not be therapists.
"""Hi, just calling back to see how you went.  Let me know if you need assistance""."
From experience I would say that very, very few are unqualified at all - the training is very rigorous and only people who are passionate and good at it stay on to actually get on the phones unsupervised.  The unfortunate fact is that Lifeline is run by volunteers who routinely have to face some pretty dreadful working conditions. Yes, there are individuals who call imminently suicidal, and Lifeline workers are trained to help these people. These are in fact few and far between (I would estimate somewhere around one to three calls per year). Lifeline has become a de facto generic mental health help line, rather than exclusively suicide prevention, and the result is that quite a number of calls you take are from people needing to vent, hear some reassurance or get access to services. These are the good calls where you actually feel you‚Äôre connecting and helping someone, but at the same time Lifeline is limited in resources, and providing 100% free counselling over the phone encourages some callers to rely on it, depriving people imminently in danger (e.g. suicide, psychotic episodes, domestic violence) from being able to reach the service. So time is precious, and typically Lifeline workers aim to hear these people out, help, but more importantly direct them to local services better equipped to support them.  But then there‚Äôs the bad calls. You get a lot of these. Alcoholics who ring repeatedly spouting torrents of abuse towards to you. Delusional people who just cannot be helped, but who you worry about. People who have had bad experiences with Lifeline in the past and take it out on you. Prank calls are an unfortunately frequent occurrence. It‚Äôs rough. And if you‚Äôre a woman, you get sex calls shockingly often - people who pretend to be having a rough time, wanting to hear you speak in a soft, comforting voice, subtly trying to get you to use suggestive language, who take weird pleasure in revealing they‚Äôve been masurbating the whole time.   What I‚Äôm saying is that almost every Lifeline worker I‚Äôve met starts out a shift with a goal of really helping people, and are fully trained to do so (it takes a months long course, and years of provisional placement  before you‚Äôre fully qualified). They‚Äôre serious about this work, and they‚Äôre doing it for free. But it‚Äôs entirely possible that they‚Äôve been putting up with a world of shit in their prior 3 calls and don‚Äôt quite meet your needs or use the right tone or language with you. As /u/ADuckNamedPhil said, they‚Äôre people too.
Callers were permitted to ask for counselors by name at our center. However, when those requests are repeated or the caller is insistent upon speaking to that person and not others, we would stop fulfilling that request. For repeat callers, it can add some level of continuity. When it becomes a potential boundary issue, it is remedied. 
Thank you for sparing me from having to Google that 
I mean, it IS my turn next, but I would legit let Mike cut. 
I have a cousin named Michael AND I played gta and had a character named Michael üòé
What would be the problem with a caller requesting to speak with the same counsellor every time rather than another? Surely once a bond is formed a better outcome is achieved?
No problem :) In situations wherein a caller is being abusive at the present time or in the past OR if the caller is on a time/call limit for the day (this is only in extreme cases of regular callers who would call 10+ times per day). If it were an abusive caller who is unable to calm down, you warn that you will need to hang up. If it continues, ‚ÄúYou have continued to be abusive and I need to end the call. I hope you will call back when you are ready to talk to me.‚Äù And if it continues still - we would hang up. At some point, a caller may be banned permanently for this type of behavior despite many warnings and temporary bans. Sometimes it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill you,‚Äù other times it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to describe very detailed and disturbing sexual things that I want to do to you.‚Äù   For regulars who called multiple times per day, every day - they knew their limits. Usually it was 3 calls a day. We would just remind them which call they are on and ask if they would like to talk now or later in the day. We wouldn‚Äôt hang up on these callers but would make sure they understood the limits and that we needed to speak to others in crisis as well. Sometimes a person would be in a worse mood/situation than usual and we made changes for that when necessary. We were a small center and without those limits, our lines would be tied up most of the day with regulars while others would be unable to get through.   Basically we would make it clear that we do care but there have to be limits so we can keep the callers and ourselves as safe as possible. 
"More specifically it means ""May God reward you with goodness."" "
"The problem might be shifts or the person quitting or having other engagements within the organisation. Not to mention many people working lifelines are volunteers who shouldn't feel guilty about not being there for a specific person time and time again. It drains you when we're talking about something as serious as suicide. You might even end up with a bunch of people specifically asking for you. It's a lot to put on a person.   Also, it's meant as an ""on the spot"" type of help, they're not therapists. A therapist is a better choice if you need longterm help. "
So like a good spell. 
I love this, what a lucky dad, what a lucky daughter.
"Those are some pretty mean things to sign at your dad.... ""You thought you were standing beside me You were only in my way"""
What a wonderful human being
I think I remember reading here on reddit somewhere that a lot of deaf people like rock because they can feel the vibrations and beat of the music so that‚Äôs how they enjoy it. Not sure how true. 
Fun fact, at this years Wacken Open Air festival, they had a sign language translator for some artists and songs. The world is getting more inclusive and I like it.
‚ÄúI. HATE. EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUUU‚Äù  *dad stops dancing*
Jesus I might have cried the most at this post than any other!!!!
I hope I have a daughter that wants to hang out with me at that age.
He‚Äôs not hearing impaired. He‚Äôs Deaf. Its not a bad word.  Deaf people have their own culture and embrace it. 
That is daughter and father love,such a angel she is.
I love Deaf Leopard!!!
Random onion chopping ninjas. Gonna go hug my kids a bit extra. 
Absolute dad goals. A daughter who enjoys spending time with you, and makes sure you try  things out of your comfort zone. I'm so happy for him. 
This is the opposite of my chinese dad trying to sing celine dion in the car.
He must have done an awesome job raising her to create a beautiful human like this. 
My dad is getting very hard of hearing as he gets older and I've been passing him notes when we're at gatherings because he misses most of what is being said in crowds. I'm trying to get him to get a smart phone so I can text him things as they are said, but he staunchly refuses to own such a new fangled contraption. 
Ah, so this must be a Three Days Grace concert! The song is Just Like You if anyone is curious
Turns out she wasn‚Äôt signing the song, but having an argument with her dad. 
Top 5 probably
Anything that has decent bass they should be able to enjoy. I have seen deaf people place their hands on a subwoofer to feel the music.
I worked security at festivals. There was always this guy that came in with a balloon.  He would hold the balloon to his ear and rest the other side to a column or pole that held up the roof to the stage. I'd watch him nod his head to the beat for hours. He started coming at a young age. And through the years the festival got more and more hippie. I noticed he wasnt enjoying himself as much one year. I wrote a note asking if he was ok. He started a little panic attack. That year his friends fed him acid for the first time. After he wrote me saying he was tripping for the first time, I took him backstage to hang out with the bands and other staff. Mostly so we could make sure he was gonna be alright. The memory of the smile on his face will provide me with warm fuzziness the rest of my life. 
They had a man and woman doing a duet style translation at the reserved viewing area for people with disabilities at Disney World during the big parade in the Magic Kingdom, and they are honestly fascinating to watch. Really theatrical. I caught myself zoning out watching them and forgetting about the parade several times.
The song in OP is way more insulting IMO   >You thought you were there to guide me, you were only in my way! You were wrong if you think that I'll be JUST LIKE YOU
Sorry but I just pictured you crying while disco dancing at midnight. 
I‚Äôm 24 and my dad has always been one of my favorite people to hang out with. Music is really what we bond over (and old movies) so he‚Äôs also my favorite concert buddy. 62 with 2 total knee replacements did not stop him from getting in the pit with me at Rise Against hahah 
You don‚Äôt have to hope. Just raise her right. Set the example, show love and empathy. 
Sheeeeeit, you know that dude‚Äôs seen Bob Seger and the silver bullet band at least a few times in his day.
It‚Äôs been a real long time I haven‚Äôt listened to that band, the last time I listened to them was during my Jr.High years. 
And he was just bobbing his head in response.
Looks like she‚Äôs using SEE- signed exact English, but based off ASL signs.  Her signs are correct, but she‚Äôs using them in a very spoken English order.  For most signing languages, they have a different emphasis on word order, and some of it can be more conceptual or visual than keeping to the sentence structure of a spoken language.  Based off of this, and the father‚Äôs age, I‚Äôm betting he either went deaf later in life, or was taught in a more hearing-based way- as opposed to being immersed in the dead world.
One of my teachers had previously taught at a school for the deaf. The school had dances like any other school but he said that the bass was turned SO high up that he thought he was having a heart attack.   Said the deaf dances were easier to chaperone because you could sign at them and they couldn‚Äôt pretend not to hear you over the music. 
Went to Disney World the first time this year, and I was actually blown away by how well done everything is. I was there with some friends (all adults, no kids), and I wasn't really expecting much since I thought it was for kids, but the fire works, parades, characters, performances, and rides were insane. I actually had a blast.  
how do you think he went deaf
Yeah, they‚Äôve changed a bit now, have a different vocalist because of some stuff that happened a few years back. But still a great band for nostalgia haha 
Could it be that she's doing it in the grammatical order the song uses, rather than doing a full translation?
*signing:* Sorry, what was that, I can‚Äôt see you over the music!
You can feel more than that, you can feel the individual notes they all have different vibrations, if you've played guitar for a long time sometimes you can tell what chord you are playing just from the vibration 
Dang ol‚Äô Ted Nugent at the Pontiac SilverDome in 76.  Aerosmith, The Outlaws, Foghat and the Nuge.  Edit: that was a real show too, look it up.
oooh. are you offering up some hot three days grace goss??
This for sure, it takes a goddamn degree to translate to correct grammar while someone speaks, and when someone is singing with metaphors and idioms is even harder. She's probably just going off of memory of the song too and not interpreting as she's listening. *probably*
üòÇ not really, they haven‚Äôt been super vocal about the events that led up to the split. Adam, the original singer, left because of health issues and from what I understand they went on tour without him or something and then had a fight about that?? But to be completely honest I don‚Äôt really know, just know that both sides have thrown some shade at the other since Adam left
"Such a simple but amazing photo.  Your mom suffered so much loss. And here she's got a chance to hear her daughter's heartbeat within a body so different. I can't imagine the kinds of emotions she's feeling.  And this healthy looking, ""tough guy"" with  his funky hair, Vegas shirt and his cool tattoo sleeve with a shark on his hand. You would never imagine him needing anything from anyone, much less a heart. But he did.  So underneath that tough guy exterior beats the heart of a much loved, much missed sister and daughter. Imagine that.    Edit: Self-hijacking to link to [OP's latest comment with additional context](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/carkjt/a_year_ago_my_little_sister_left_this_world_this/etazi21) that makes this photo even more meaningful. Please read OP's comment. I'm an organ donor. You should be too."
Thanks everyone for all the heartfelt comments. I could not stop crying today when my mother shared this picture with me. I work from home and my fiance is far away so I had no one to share it with.   This was the text she sent me  > I will confess when I first heard the heartbeat I broke down, but Kyle bless him he hugged me until I stopped crying then his mom hugged me while Tina (older sister) listened. The picture you saw was taken about 1/2 hour later when Kyle helped me try again so I could listen longer.  If you're not already an organ donor please sign up. When we were facing so many difficult decisions this one my loving sister had already made for us. We knew what she wanted. It made the struggle one step easier. The impact it has had on the lives of the recipients is beyond words.  Edit: My mom laughed at all the comments about the stethoscope being backwards  > Lol the stethoscope was backwards. Kyle had them in his ears first to find the best spot so when I moved them to my ears the were wrong but worked  Edit 2: Thank you again for all the well wishing, condolences, and personal stories. My mom and Kyle have both seen this post. This photo was originally posted on [Midwest Transplant Network](https://www.facebook.com/MidwestTransplantNetwork) to help them raise awareness of the importance of organ donation. I am overwhelmed by the number of comments made from Redditors who have been inspired to opt in as well as support from those who previously made the decision. Thank you for choosing to support the gift of life.  Edit 3 8/Jul: My mother messaged me on Facebook this morning  > I was amazed at all the kind words from so many people! Thanks for sharing if just one person‚Äôs life is saved so worth it.
This is why organ donation is so important. ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is beyond wholesome
I can‚Äôt imagine the feeling of hearing a heartbeat you first heard from inside yourself inside another person. I love when donor families and recipients do this, though! It‚Äôs got to bring some sense of closure.
I actually don't know what to think about this:  This must be hard, it must be hard to hear that heart, that one heart once beating in your daughter, now beating into someone else's chest. It must be painful, must feel unfair, stolen... and if this is part of everything she, or better the whole family, is feeling, I just can say I'm close to you.  At the same time it must feel good, to know that the same heart has now a new chance to keep beating, keep pumping, feel life flowing through it. It's not done, not yet, it has still work to do.  And see that guy who's now standing there, feeling that gift, a gift of life, a life who didn't surrender, showing his gratitude, showing after all she's still there, pumping, alive... this truly is wholesome  It's a weird situation, a weird feeling, but overall I think it's a good one
My brother donated his heart and kidneys 10 years ago, and we have never heard from the recipients. We can‚Äôt contact them.   It‚Äôs such a bummer, but I understand. :(
Choked me up a little.
I remember hearing my daughter's heartbeat for the first time when I went in for my first ultrasound.  That's probably the instant I fell in love with her.  I don't know if it would normally bring me any comfort to hear her heart beating in another person's body, but she told me once that in the case of a fatal accident, she hoped they could salvage her organs in time to help someone else live longer.  She was so passionate about it, which makes me think that her gift of love to a complete stranger would somehow bring me solace.
"Most ""tough guys"" I know are also some of the nicest people I know."
Well put!

Hey, I lost my dad last year and we recently met up with a man who received his heart.   The guy my dad's heart saved had a family, a business, and his own full life. It basically have him a new start, and a MASSIVE amount more freedom. He had a long-term heart condition that caused him to be hospitalized for the majority of 5 years before he received the heart. When my dad died, they got some amazing life-saving news. It gives you a small silver lining about losing someone close to you. Even though it was one of the worst times for me, it always helped to think that so many people were being helped, and a few were actually SAVED (he was able to donate multiple organs along with tissue).   I think it's really good that people can see this kind of thing, and know that some happiness can come out of a really horrible experience. I hope you are doing well, and thanks for sharing the story!
I cannot put myself in your moms shoes.   She must have heard that heartbeat when her daughter was just as tiny as a peanut, while still in the womb.   She held her for the first time when she was just a teeny tiny seven pounds baby.  She must have seen every first - first crawl, first steps, first cry, first giggle, first laugh, first roll over, first words, first day at school and every first and all the other firsts there could have been.   Kyle is a nice guy. Thank you Kyle for making a moms day. I am tearing up at what you did for this mom. Every mom deserves to know her kid is still alive someway in the world.  Edit: thanks for my first silver stranger! It made my whole year!  Edit 1: thank you for the gold and the silver strangers. Love conquers all.
If you're in australia be sure to opt in online. It takes about 10 minutes :)
I am not crying you are crying‚ù§Ô∏è
I am sorry for the loss of your brother and that you've not heard back. It is a delicate scenario. In my heart I accepted the donation as having done the right thing and its what my sister wanted. I have not been in contact with any of the recipients myself. I am just not ready nor am I certain I will ever be. My mother has received wedding pictures from one of the kidney recipients and she shared this one with me today. Have faith your brother made a life saving gift and gave people a chance. The pain of loosing a loved one never goes away but there is a certain level of comfort in knowing life continues. <3
I was a heart recipient 8 months ago and I‚Äôve been having a hard time getting down to write my letter of gratitude to the donor‚Äôs family. Your comment has inspired me to get it done by my next clinic visit. Would hate for them not to have this option.   Your brother is a big part of giving others a second chance at life. He truly lives on. Sending you lots of love.
Yup. A real ‚Äútough guy,‚Äù not one who has to try to prove he‚Äôs a tough guy to everyone and himself, isn‚Äôt afraid of being genuine and showing emotion.
I hope you are also doing well and thank you for sharing. I never know the words to express what this whole process is like. Its a kaleidoscope of emotion. Hearing from other people who just understand has been very helpful.
Thank you for sharing this
My buddy passed away about 5 years ago. He was an organ donor and donated his heart to a 50 year old woman and a kidney to a child in need.   I noticed I wasn‚Äôt an organ donor for some reason. (Prob messed up when I was a dumb 17 year old) but as soon as my buddy‚Äôs mom heard her sons heart beat again, I went to the DMV the next day and updated my license to an organ donor.
Oh man this perspective hit me hard. I think these things are touching but they never got me like they seemed to with some people. Now I understand completely why it matters so much to some people. Earlier today my girlfriend of a few years who I love more than anything was holding me and I could hear her heartbeat. If I ever lost her but her heart was able to save someone, hearing her heart beat again would make me feel things I would never get to feel otherwise.  Thank you. Also screw you though because I'm crying at work.
I must be the toughest guy cause i can cry pretty easily.
This man is a legend 
I've had my rescue dog for about 3 years now, and still on occasion I've gotta sit down on the kitchen floor next to his bowl and hand feed him a couple pieces of his food because he seems too scared to start on his own. No clue what triggers it sometimes, and I definitely don't mind doing it.  [Obligatory Good Boy Tax](https://imgur.com/a/BMkJo5r) 
There are a lot of assholes in this world but things like this restore your faith in humanity 
Anybody asking for angels.....send them his address. 
This poor dog has probably severe trauma about eating (being beaten when he ate , surviving poisonning etc...) good job, you brighten the humanity...
‚ÄúWhat? I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying.‚Äù
Maybe the guy just likes eating from dog bowls
A friend of mine rescued a dog as a puppy, maybe 6 months old.   The dog still cries whenever her food bowl is brought out, and she even cries the whole time she‚Äôs eating as well.   It‚Äôs like she associates food and dinnertime with fear. They help her a lot and let her eat calmly, without any distractions.  They‚Äôve also had her fully checked by their vet to make sure she‚Äôs not in physical pain while she eats.   Makes me so sad to think what that baby dog must have gone through to be that scared to eat. 
I see this quite but every time i do i smile and upvote....so here's an upvote feller 
I was like why does it matter that it's a vet, then I realized vet = veterinarian.
Agree
He is so cute!! Nice cat too :)
Before we figured out that my husband wearing shoes made our feral cat afraid to eat her wet food, I would convince her to eat by pretending to eat from her bowl while making loud omnom and slurpy sounds. Then I would pass the bowl to her and she would finally give it a try.  edit-- people have been asking for pictures of our sweet little ginger girl: https://imgur.com/a/oD0s9vg  She bonded with our other kitties first. It took about a year before I was able to pet her. Even when she started snuggling in the crook of my arm, I still wasn't allowed to pet her without getting teefies.
Same as my boy, Pretzel.  I know he was mistreated as sometimes when I touch the wrong part of his leg/underside he will growl/snap, but I know he doesn't mean it.  He just has bad memories and sad/worried eyes often.  Sometimes he doesn't eat. I made him dog biscuits one time too and he refused to eat them lol. At least I know he always loves schmackos.  He is so delicate and wary when eating, I have to encourage and coddle him.  He was really scared the first time I met him and I basically had to force him in my car. He took some schmackos and just slept the whole ride home, then joined me in my bed when we got home and has never left. He is such a velcro dog and hates being left alone for even a short time. The first and second pictures are him trying to look for me when I went to get the mail, looking out a second story window <3  I was thrift shopping at the animal welfare league and a lady who fostered dogs was delivering dog beds she makes. She was talking about how naughty Pretzel was being, pooping in the house etc and jumping on the bed, but I think she was a little grumpy and being too hard on him. I asked about him ad she even tried to tell me I wouldn't want him. But I ignored her and now we are bonded :D  https://imgur.com/a/QaiMnKE
There's many many more people like this guy than the bad ones.
Nonononono. He needs to say on earth for a while for those doggies.
I usually say we don't deserve dogs but people like this guy do. 
The mere thought of a dog being deprived of food is enough to make me sick. When I hear my dog‚Äôs collar clinking against his food bowl, I know he‚Äôs enjoying his meal and my heart is filled with joy and love. How someone could ever soundly go to sleep after eating their own dinner without feeding their dog, who is so dependent on them for nourishment, is beyond me. 
Pedagree!
That cat looks like it puts up with some stuff (in the best way possible).
So....you're in the kitchen feeding the cat, your husband walks in from running an errand and sees you, and he immediately pops his shoes off?
The bad ones are just more vocal
Let me rephrase that to angels on Earth.
He has a PET DEGREE 
Yeah, she/he only takes half of his bed and even lets him sleep there.
If he has the bad timing to pull in the driveway during Amber's breakfast time, he has to take his shoes off outside. He pouted about the arrangement at first, but in recent years he's been making an effort to bond with her.
Like you... FUCK YOUR ANTI-PINAPPLE AGENDA
Hey, look at this guy! He isn't on board with anti-pineapple agendas! HE WANTS THE TERRORISTS TO WIN! GET HIM!
I knew he was the one when the only fight he ever started in high school was when someone was making fun of him for mourning his childhood cat.
EGG HIM
He's... he's *gettin' off* on all this!!
BUT DID SHE GET THE PICTURE OF HIM AT HIS GAME???  ...so many questions
"""My name is \[Jordan\] and I have a basketball game tomorrow"""
He seems to look much happier in the picture on the right.
A $75 limit wasn't enough to buy decent shoes? I mean, super nice, generous thing to do but I'm stuck on the implication that $75 is not enough for kids shoes
Wow, this touched me. I remeber getting picked on by the kids on my middle school basketball team for my shoes.
how the hell do they not have any under $75
"All the jackasses going ""hmmm Victoria secret bag so fishy"" apparently have never had a Wife or Girlfriend. It's not a store exclusively for hookers or some shit. Literally every woman I have ever dated has bought shit from there. Get out of your fuckin basements and meet some real people you fuckin neck beards. "
Paying it forward. This young lady‚Äôs parents raised her right.
When I was a kid it was rare we had money for anything extra and so when someone did something like this it meant the world to me.  This kid will remember this for a long long time.
He can't play basketball in his almost new looking shoes? He needs a new pair of nikes to play middle school basketball? Okay i guess.
Why female bro? Bro doesnt need a gender, a BRO is a BRO
Naw, he just dunked a Wendy's cup into a trashcan and that was all the proof she needed.
Yeah, like question two: what's in the Victoria's secret bag? 
He now actually has shoe game 
He's got his arm around a beautiful lady with a beautiful heart *and* he's got new shoes. 
He is still hover handing her. Future bulletproof politician here. 
She's gorgeous tbf 
^  this   besides doesnt he wear nikes?
"My dad wasn't poor, and he was a great Dad, but he didn't believe in spending money on shoes because he said ""I'd grow out of them too quickly."" He said when I was older he would get me more expensive shoes. That never happened. I had to pick my basketball shoes from Payless and they had to be under $20.  =/   Granted, this was 25 years ago, so that would probably be about $45 today. We found a pair that was ""genuine leather"" and that was the nicest pair they had for under $20.  I bought my first pair of Nikes with my own money when I got a job in high school. I always wanted Nikes when I was in middle school or Jr. High. They didn't even have to be Jordans, just any Nike. "
last time i bought a pair of running shoes, the cheapest pair in the entire store (dicks) were on clearance for $55   clearance. $55.
Get this kid a contract STAT
thats Victorias secret
I thought he was always saying shoot game.  TIL.
im playing point guard
That is so epic
Yeah I‚Äôm kinda confused that this kid‚Äôs parents are willing to let a stranger pay for his shoes because $75 is too much, yet he‚Äôs already decked out in full Nike which isn‚Äôt exactly cheap. Props to the girl for being super generous but this whole thing feels weird 
That‚Äôs fine for basic walking around shoes, but they likely won‚Äôt be the same quality for playing games like basketball. Most good basketball shoes cost more due to materials and overall design.   I used to have this same conversation with my mom and skate shoes. Yes I can get ones at target for $25. But when they rip and tear insanely faster than the more expensive shoes and I have to go get another pair of shoes the cost doesn‚Äôt end up being much less.   I‚Äôm not saying he needed top of the line Lebrons, just that Payless/target shoes aren‚Äôt necessarily a better choice because they‚Äôre cheaper. 
I'm trying to be the same way with the stepkid but his friends make it so difficult specially with their parents buying them $150 nikes 
Lebron is already tweeting for him to join the Lakers!
juLIEN!!
You can get LOTS of nike clothes on clearance sales. Not the same with shoes. I just bought a nike running shirt last week on sale from $60 marked down to $8. 
If he's a good kid he won't mind later in life. I remember cordial and sandwiches when other kids had MacDonald's and soda, and it sucked sometimes, but I respect my parents now for doing the best they could.  Just takes time.
Sometimes, but boys quickly wear men's sizes. My own teenage boy has been in men's sizes since he was 11.
Sorry. The kid wants to be on a playoff team. 
IM A VIRGO
This will shape him psychologically and when he's in college he'll be dating a woman in her 30's and living his best life
There is so much Nike on clearance at our local Marshall's. Its actually quite aggravating since I don't buy/wear it. But you can get the shorts for like $8-10 and shirts for $3-10. Never seen decent Nine shoes for less than $60-100 on sale. 
Thing is before he didn't really care he would ask for vans or Converses. Now because his friends got airmax 250 from their parents now he wants them.  I already got him some $80 Adidas. I can perfectly afford to get him $200 sneakers but it's not about him being a good kid, I mean his grades are great, behavior just your typical teenage shit once in a while. But there's no need for $expensive ass sneakers
Stop doing Aries shit!
I can't imagine the feeling of running into a burning skyscraper knowing you may never make it back down those same steps. Massive amounts of respect to the heroes who charged in on that day. Would have been absolutely terrifying.
I don't know how you could forget. I was 26 and worked in a high rise in Boston. We got evacuated as a precaution after the ~~first~~ second plane hit in NY. I had clients in the WTC. We all ran out in to the street and no one knew what to do or where to go.  When I made it home, I was glued to the TV, watching these brave men and women try to save anyone they could. I cannot imagine being in their shoes, running in to peril without a second thought for their own safety. They were the first sign that, despite the horror, the U.S. would fight back and do it's best to protect us. I have a long history of opposition to our government, but I will never have anything but respect and awe for first responders.
Salute! In honor and remembrance to all who passed away and fought bravely that tragic day. Never forgotten
"I see a lot of FDNY in the streets on 9/11 and it always reminds me how much they suffered that day. As a New Yorker who was here on 9/11 and had to walk the FDR alone at 17 with a bunch of strangers...even though I was scared... every few blocks there were rows of ppl who were passing out snacks and water for everyone trekking home...I ended up finally in Queens (the 7 was running only into the 1st stop in Queens but oh man did that AC feel good even with the crowds)  ready to walk some more when a UPS driver pulled up next to me and said ""where are you going?"" I hopped into the back and there were at least 10 ppl sitting down with water, sweaty and disheveled waiting to get home too. It was a day that is stuck in my memory and reminds me so much that even though it feels like we are falling apart at the seams...we really came together that day."
We did this in Highschool at my local Votech, I was in the protective services program. We did it every year (until graduation) and it never got easier. We split into groups of four to run it, and the most amount of flights we ‚Äúachieved‚Äù was 63. Kids were puking, but we never complained because we did it to honor those who did what they had to do, without complaint. Without a second thought. They were and are true heroes.
That is some serious stamina these guys have, respect to that.
"I was 15 and in high school in rural NC when it happened. I was in Phys Ed, when it started but didnt hear anything until I got out of there and the principal made an announcement over the PA.  ""A plane has struck the WTC."" Being 15 it didn't ring a bell until I walked in my Honors World Hostory class.  2 things will always stick out to me.  Someone asked my teacher what we were learning that day. This man was a big strong man - line coach for the football team - and could tower over you. In a somber tone, he said, ""You're living it today."" The 11th & 12th we watched the news.  When I got home from school, my dad was frozen watching CNN. I asked him what's wrong, and he reaches out for me. I sit beside him and as he puts an arm around me he says, ""Your brother's generation had the Challenget. Yours will have this."" We sat there in silence and it was one of the few times I saw tears in his eyes."
I never thought I would encounter anything like this, but I've recently started going to the gym in the morning and there was a man in full firefighter gear hoofing it up the stair master. Pretty unique and meaningful tribute I have to say.
My uncle was right there when it happened. 15 years later he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He never drank or smoked and we don't have cancer running in our family. Doctors said it was probably because of what he inhaled on that day. I miss him so much.
My father was actually a first responder with the NYPD. Thought he was never going to see me again. Left me a letter saying how he was sorry that he couldn‚Äôt raise me, he wrote a goodbye note thinking he was going to die. Definitely weird reading that when I found it years later. Seriously motivated me to join the Army -which I am now a cadet- and I definitely learned a lot
They do this at a local station here as well. Very awesome to honor those fallen. The ESPN story about the kid from Boston College with the red bandana gets me every fucking year also. If you've never watched that, you need to. Definition of a kick ass human being. Bring tissues if this stuff easily gets you. An amazing story about an amazing individual  Edited for a quick link:  https://vimeo.com/57392462
I‚Äôll never forget visiting the museum a few years ago. I had just gotten to the balcony, overlooking the last column, when I look off to my right. All the friends who were with me didn‚Äôt notice it, but they had a small display there. A hidden projector was cycling through scans of missing persons posters, and right as I get close enough to read them a new one pops up. A picture of a man, smiling at the camera, poorly centered on a piece of white paper. On the bottom, in shaky uneven writing that looked like crayon, it said ‚ÄòHave you seen my dad.‚Äô Needless to say, everyone found the quiet backwoods guy crying on a bench with his head in his hands.
18 years.   I was a 9 yo German kid, that didn‚Äôt really understand it, but knew it was important.   No matter what, I will never forget this horrible day.    As every year, I‚Äòll drink on those who lost their life, on those who risked their life and wish the best for all who were affected by it.
Today's my bday. I decided I wanted to take on this tradition after working at the tallest building in ATX.   Ran my 110 flights.   Mind you this was without any gear or any of the stress involved with saving lives, and I'm also in pretty good shape (I play semi pro football) and it was pretty grueling to hit that many.    Next year I want to do it with a weighted vest.
I wonder if the buildings falling was even on anyone's mind. Like it had never really happened before so I imagine most people ran in just thinking about the damage and fire.
I am 17 years old, a senior in high school. I was in the womb when 9/11 occured. Most of my classmates were either also in the womb or not yet conceived when it occured.  An entire generation has grown up knowing nothing but the aftermath. Experiencing fear. Taking your shoes off in airports. Even racism and prejudice, if they happened to be Muslim or even just having dark skin.  Not to mention war. A lot of my classmates didn't even know we were at war until they were told, and this war has been going on their entire lives.  I hope within my lifetime 9/11 stops being so painful, an inhibitor, and instead we use the tragedy to grow, past it and beyond, as a society and planet, towards a more progressive and safer future. I really do.
One of the few events these days where everyone remembers exactly where they were and what they were doing
I helped with one of these last year at my local college, and I distinctly remember a priest (who was the chaplain for a local fire department) doing this in full gear with his guys, and he had a picture of [Fr. Mychal Judge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mychal_Judge) taped to his air tank. The whole event was incredibly powerful -- the silence in which the firefighters went up and down the stairs was truly something to behold.   Edit: Fr. Mychal Judge was the chaplain for the New York City Fire Department, and he was the first certified casualty of 9/11. Most of you have probably seen [the famous photograph of Fr. Mychal being carried out of the ruined North Tower by several firefighters.](https://i.imgur.com/vZPPmHg.jpg)
According to Keynes, we humans tend to be overtly optimistic whenever we feel we're acting positively and do not make any calculations on the impact of our actions on the long run.
I don‚Äôt know what they were thinking, but the buildings falling was absolutely a worry for everyone around me while we were watching this unfold on the news.
They didn‚Äôt think they would fall, the first tower survived a bombing in 93, it was supposed to be indestructible like the titanic.  After the first tower was hit people in the second tower stayed in the building because they didn‚Äôt think it could possibly happen again. The whole day was one surprise after the other, they didn‚Äôt know what happened or why and they weren‚Äôt prepared for anything like it
"Thank you for recognizing this. All of us ""old"" guys still remember how it used to be before a perpetual state of emergency, endless war, security theater, mass surveillance, and xenophobia.   We're able to remember a time before it, so, we still think of it as--potentially--temporary. You've known it all your life.   My fear is that your generation won't question its sensibility--you'll take it for granted or accept it as normal. I'm heartened to know that you, at least, do not."
Hell, I was six at the time and even I remember my limited and overall confusing experience of it, even if I didn‚Äôt have a real grasp of the significance of such a tragedy.
"Heroes were made and lost that day.   Guys like [Rick Rescorla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rescorla) and emergency crews who ran into those buildings, knowing what *could* happen. Rick had planned for this, jets hitting the towers, and saved ~~2,300~~ 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees that day.   >At 8:46 a.m. on the morning of September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center (Tower 1). Rescorla heard the explosion and saw the tower burning from his office window in the 44th floor of the South Tower (Tower 2). When a Port Authority announcement came over the P.A. system urging people to stay at their desks, Rescorla ignored the announcement, grabbed his bullhorn, walkie-talkie, and cell phone, and began systematically ordering Morgan Stanley employees to evacuate, including the 1,000 employees in WTC 5. He directed people down a stairwell from the 44th floor, continuing to calm employees after the building lurched violently following the crash of United Airlines Flight 175 38 floors above into Tower 2 at 9:03 A.M. Morgan Stanley executive Bill McMahon stated that even a group of 250 people visiting the offices for a stockbroker training class knew what to do because they had been shown the nearest stairway.  >Rescorla had boosted morale among his men in Vietnam by singing Cornish songs from his youth, and now he did the same in the stairwell, singing songs like one based on the Welsh song ""Men of Harlech"":  >""Men of Cornwall stop your dreaming, Can‚Äôt you see their spearpoints gleaming?,  >See their warriors‚Äô pennants streaming, To this battlefield.  >Men of Cornwall stand ye steady, It cannot be ever said ye for the battle were not ready  >Stand and never yield!""[3]  >Between songs, Rescorla called his wife, telling her, ""Stop crying. I have to get these people out safely. If something should happen to me, I want you to know I've never been happier. You made my life."" After successfully evacuating most of Morgan Stanley's 2,687 employees, he went back into the building.[3][11][12] When one of his colleagues told him he too had to evacuate the World Trade Center, Rescorla replied, ""As soon as I make sure everyone else is out.""[13] He was last seen on the 10th floor, heading upward, shortly before the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 A.M. His remains were never found.[10][11][12] Rescorla was declared dead three weeks after the attacks.[3]  ""You see, for Rick Rescorla, this was a natural death. People like Rick, they don‚Äôt die old men. They aren‚Äôt destined for that and it isn‚Äôt right for them to do so. It just isn‚Äôt right, by God, for them to become feeble, old, and helpless sons of bitches. There are certain men born in this world, and they‚Äôre supposed to die setting an example for the rest of the weak bastards we‚Äôre surrounded with.‚Äù   \- Dan Hill, Rescorla's best friend  and fellow Vietnam vet  https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/02/11/the-real-heroes-are-dead  Edit: Thanks /u/NmClark93 for telling me, [just today Rick received the Presidential Citizens Medal for his bravery on 9/11](https://www.nj.com/news/2019/09/trump-to-give-late-nj-911-hero-the-presidential-citizens-medal.html)  Edit2: [This is one the songs Rick was singing in the stairwell.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRtnWVvDX6k)"
"I think most of my classmates are aware something is wrong and want to change. There's something inherently wrong about the way we live day to day, I think.  Practicing lockdown drills, going to war for something we don't remember happening, the fearmongering and near daily tragedy and terrorism that we just mumble ""aw, not again!"" at.   We even make memes and jokes about those tragedies because we're so desensitized to all the bloodshed that there's no horror or pain left to feel. Just humor.  I think the goal of commiting 9/11 wasn't to break some buildings. I think the goal was to CAUSE that fearmongering, to stain entire generations with it. To make an ever present fear of the next bombing or shooting or mass death. To further desensitize us so the next hit doesn't have as much backlash.  It's awful. I want my children and everyone else's children to not just say ""aw man, again?"" when something bad happens.  And I think a lot of my peers feel the same about that.  Change is inevitably coming with my generation as we get older and enter positions of power. I know it, and I just hope we can be effective in that."
Man... I love you for sharing this...
‚ÄúYou made my life.‚Äù üò≠
Rick Rescorla's whole life story is super interesting... I'd definitely watch that movie.
"Thank you. We always say ""never forget"" but people like Rick are the ones we shouldn't be forgetting. How are we to remember him if we don't hear his story. I'm going to dwell on Rick today, and I will remember him with pride in my heart for a man I never knew."
I read it every year on this date. Then ugly cry for a little while.  I hope I can be one tenth of the human he was.
Not ashamed to admit I shed a tear over this. Holy shit what a human being.  Thanks for sharing.
What's great to me is that emergency preparedness is something a lot of people can engage in and it can really make a difference. And at the very bottom, it's just humans looking out for other humans. Make sure you have some extra supplies for yourself and anyone else that might be in need nearby you. Try to be a calm fixture for other people because panic does not lead to solutions.
This hero has a sad ending.  He is serving 10 years for armed robbery. I was so sad to see this hero not helped avoid the life. He made the choice I know but it still bothers me he is in federal prison.
There was a similar story in West London where a drill rapper called Sav12 chased down a guy who kidnapped a girl for 20 minutes on his motorbike and ended up saving her. Takes a different kind of dedication when you're a 15 year old on a bike though but thought I'd mention it since they're similar stories, click [here if you want to read an actual news source](https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/sav-12-saves-girl-drill-rapper/).
This kid chased down a man named Harold Herr who was paroled after serving 20 years for kidnapping and raping a young girl in ‚Äò89. Back then the girl was outside her home playing with her younger brother and one of their friends, just riding tricycles up and down the sidewalk. He beckoned the girl over and she approached the van. He reached out and yanked her through the window before speeding off, taking her to a secluded field, raping her, and abandoning her there. She was recovered later that day by the police and returned to her family.  That was my sister and I was left on the tricycle wondering where she went.  This kid saved some girl and her family from unimaginable pain. I know his story went to shit later, but he‚Äôs still a hero to me.
How bout a link, OP?
[Video: Temar recounts how it unfolded](https://youtu.be/Fd31e02l3jk)
The mom of the rescued girl wrote him a helluva character for his trial, too.  I believe the actual sentence was 4 to ten years,depending on his behaviour while in jail.  Wonder how he's going.
Cool to hear that someone such as a drill rapper that is associated with London gang culture did something so honourable and kind
Oh my god that‚Äôs awful for you and your family, I hope you‚Äôre all doing ok now
why is this getting downvotes? he is just asking for a proof, otherwise this heart-warming story could completely be made up. Fucking redditors.
He even used the metric system @ 2:11  True hero
Idk but despite his error I truly hope this kid comes out on top. He probably saved that child‚Äôs life while he was still a child himself. I pray he gets early release and someone steps in and mentors him to greatness.

Most drill rappers are just trying to get out of it by making music. The lyrics you hear are what they are surrounded by, its their environment and what they know, most aren‚Äôt even on beef. A lot are good people just trying to get out of it doing what they have to do.  Source: lived in the blocks, seen alot of shit, managed to get out. Know many people still in it that are also doing well for themselves on the other hand.
I would generally say yeah. Something like that takes a toll and some wounds never fully heal, but overall I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve all done incredibly well considering.   My sister, his first victim, is married and has the sweetest little daughter of her own. I don‚Äôt talk to her about the incident though. I don‚Äôt want to open up any wounds of hers that have healed, and I figure if she wants to hash it out she‚Äôll bring it up.  I‚Äôm definitely the nervous one when my wife and I take our kids out. I have a tendency to look over my shoulder more than she does, but I don‚Äôt feel like it disrupts my life any more than the average cautious parent.  I don‚Äôt know how my parents worked through it. I was young at the time and our conversations about it have been brief over the years. When those boys chased him down it opened up conversation that had been buried for years. I saw my mom look like she was gonna vomit when she had to say the name Harold Herr again. I can‚Äôt imagine the rage I would feel if someone did that to one of my kids.
It's stories like this that remind me to judge people as I see them, not dig through their past. Most of my friends who have done time aren't bad people, just desperate.  Course I have had run ins with a few people who were just straight up evil. The world broke them beyond repair. Probably still hope for them too though.
I preach inside the county jails. Most of the guys in there are overall decent people who have made a few bad choices.   I am a huge advocate for banning the use of criminal record as a reason for denying employment unless it directly impacts the job (financial crime working in banking, child molester working with kids, etc). People make mistakes, serve their time, and then when they get out are unable to find work to take care of themselves so end up doing more crime. Vicious cycle.
Vicious cycle amen
When I was a kid I thought that when you got caught for a crime you had to join the police and be on their team.
This is the most insane, but wholesome thing I've ever heard.
"I remember when I worked at a Burger King and all the smokers got smoke breaks every couple hours. one guy I worked with got fed up with this and begain to take a ""coffee break"" every time a manager went out to have a smoke. He would just sit in the break room for a few minutes each time. sometimes he actuall made a cup of coffee."
My employees asked me to split their breaks into 7.5 minute breaks.   They got to smoke twice as often then. 
I'm a smoker and I think that this is an idea that is long overdue. It's also an incentive to stop smoking.  Congrats to the nonsmokers on a win... A pretty damn good win at that. 
"My boss tried to get on my ass for texting as he was walking out for a smoke break. I told him I was on my smoke break and ""smoked"" a pen. He hasn't said a word after that. "
"I've only worked two retail jobs but at both anyone was welcome to join the ""smoke"" break and just stay in the break room while the smokers went outside. Only like two people ever took management up on the offer though. It was less of a hassle to just keep working than to walk up to the break room."

Is this... a screenshot repost of another person's upload??? Of a link you can't click?
I had a friend who said he started smoking just so he could get breaks... Incredibly unfortunate. 
that's great.  6 extra days for them not to take off.  
I started taking power-naps in the toilets since I don't smoke...
Smoking is the worst decision ive ever made in my life. Trying to quit is the hardest thing ever. If you don‚Äôt smoke, do not start.
"My aunt did the same thing. When her manager tried to stop her, she said ""that's discrimination against me. They get extra paid breaks and I do not because I am not a smoker."" The manager left her alone after that"
I was the only non smoker working in a bar once. The other employees would insist that I take a non smoking smoke break to make it fair so I sat outside for 10 mins 
*I* did that, about 25 years ago. About 70% of my co-workers smoked, when they took smoke breaks, I took a break too. The manager asked me why, I told him, he said, ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt smoke!‚Äù  I said I would pretend to smoke. He let it go. 
I just picked up a smoking habit and joined the fuckers. That'll show management.
I'm amazed that companies don't have scheduled breaks. In my industry(welding/fab shop) smokers don't get more breaks than non smokers. We all have scheduled breaks(two, 5 minute breaks and a 20 minute lunch). Smokers don't have the luxury of just walking off to smoke. Pretty simple. 
Nice.
> smoked a pen  Here you dropped your ‚Äûis‚Äú
When I was working behind a food counter, we literally couldn't take smoke breaks with the smokers because if we did there would be no one to help the customers. It slowed our productivity down so much, because there's so much prep work that needs to be done or it slows the service... so the prep work sits there undone while the non-smokers futilely try to handle the growing line of people.   And then taking breaks when there were no customers around got me dirty looks from the smokers. Go figure. 
That‚Äôs how reddit works. 
Tell him to pick up a vape with a nicotine free juice instead. A lot easier on the lungs and you don't get the shitty nicotine addiction. üëç
That‚Äôs interesting because there is no law that protects non-smokers.  The manager either didn‚Äôt know or maybe just felt it was the right thing to do.  Hopefully the latter.  
After i quit smoking, i just used the smoke break to enjoy the outdoors
"WE have breaks also but smokers take additional breaks because ""They NEED to have a cigarette"" leaving those who choose to be healthier picking up the extra work every time they do this. Even if it didn't leave extra work. They are getting extra paid breaks just because they smoke."
Possibly illegal depending on state law, but reasonable, yes.  I think expecting that you'll be able to stop working to smoke when you're not on an official break is the unreasonable attitude here.
When I worked as a server, we had scheduled breaks. The smokers would go have additional breaks whenever the hell they wanted. It was only supposed to be 5 minutes but they often took 15 or longer.
Sounds like bad management 
Look at the pic
Are there laws protecting smokers?
Our smokers had to sign out every time they left to take a smoke break. Meant they usually had to work 20-30min longer than everybody else if they wanted to take their mandatory 30min break as well. Some actually stopped smoking because of this policy, others took the hit and just stayed at work 30min longer so they could take their smoke breaks. Basically staying almost 10h a month longer at work. Even if it's time spent taking a break, that's not worth it to me. Germany btw in case anyone wonders (30min break mandatory if you work 6h a day, 1h if it's 10h a day, breaks can be taken whenever you want and can be split up as you wish)
How would that be illegal (in whatever applicable state)?  I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
Not as far as I know. I believe companies have no obligation to give their employees smoke breaks.
Pretty sure it's not illegal. Most states only require a 30 min meal break if they work more than 5 consecutive hours. Could easily be misunderstanding something though, I have zero legal experience.   [Source](https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/meal.htm)
This is correct. When I was a smoker I've worked at places where you only get the normal mandatory breaks, but I've also worked at places where I could smoke every hour 
I used to run retail stores in high traffic cities. On my first day at a new company my assistant manager went outside for no less than 40 minutes during her shift to smoke multiple times. I told her she can‚Äôt use her time as liberally anymore and it‚Äôs unfair to the non smokers. She threw a fit and called HR. I demonstrated how much time she was stealing from the company and she ended up on the short end of things. The employer has no obligation to let you smoke other than the laws about breaks.
My first job they were allowed a smoke break every hour. Every job ive had since then you could only smoke on legally mandatory breaks and some places even said you cant smoke on your paid breaks only on your unpaid lunch break. 
It still blows my mind that a sizeable percentage of the population has a drug addiction where they need to take a break every few hours to get a fix. It's just so... normalized. 
Last place I worked at a manufacturing company you weren't even allowed to smoke on company's property, so come lunch time bunch of guys would be smoking on the sidewalk 
A lot of older habbits are weirdly normlized, if things like tabacco, alcohol were to be invented right now they would be treated like drugs, a lot of them have worse effects that some that are already illegal
The company I work at just instituted a policy like that. A bunch of the higher-ups in corporate are European, too, and smoke a lot. I was pretty surprised to see that policy take hold.
Look online, I just did. Lots of sources. Til, the guy is a great human being.
My son has no disabilities, but I take him every couple of months and gladly pay for admission. He enjoys Morgan's Wonderland.  The one thing that really makes me proud of him is that he is so kind of children there with disabilities.  I rather give my money to Morgan's Wonderland over six flags fiesta Texas any day.
It‚Äôs in San Antonio, TX. The best thing is that individuals with special needs get free admission.
Incredible. Modern day Santa Claus ... but real
I love this
I used to go to this place a bunch as a kid and it is so fun
I used to work for Habitat for Humanity in San Antonio, and Morgan‚Äôs wonderland would donate tickets as an appreciation gift for Habitat volunteers
I thought the city paid for quite a bit of it?  Awesome regardless, I lived in San Antonio when it opened
I‚Äôm from San Antonio and have family friends who know him. He‚Äôs genuinely the nicest, most thoughtful person.
This guy Googles
Great guy, really sad he has to state that the likes of diabetes and heart disease don‚Äôt qualify for free admission. I can only imagine the amount of people coming up looking for free admission!
My mom took me there when I was little too and it was always such a special treat. Amazing place. :)
I‚Äôm from SA and even though my kids are not special needs we had a membership for a while.  The rides are fine for anyone to get on so even hubby and I can get on any of the rides.   It is awesome.  Never any lines, lots of shade, the water park just opened last year and it‚Äôs all so much fun.  If anyone is in the area with kids under 12 or so it is a great way to spend your day.
I lived there for years and never heard of it!
wait. like the post says??!
Take. That. Back.
Not certain of this, but I think he paid for it ptimarily along with a lot of generous donors, and the city gave him generous tax incentives to build it.  He operates the park at a loss every year.
Its s really neat park even for able bodied kids, my kids really enjoyed it.  I would say the biggest thing is all activities and all rides have wheelchair accommodations.

"""special treat"" - what the fuck, were you eating 'em?"
It‚Äôs a great place! They even limit admittance to prevent crowds from causing problems with those with anxiety issues.  It‚Äôs off Wurzbach and 35, if you don‚Äôt drive over there it‚Äôs easy to miss.
Dad probably wanted to make a difference on there own terms.  True, he could have done all those things you described, but he chose to support his daughter and his cause this way.  Stop being a downer.
Think of the experiences some kids miss out on that we took for granted. This is a place that‚Äôs safe for them to make the same memories we cherish so much. I see what you‚Äôre saying but damn. So unnecessary.
Yeah, I know. Just don‚Äôt want to make a new account and then have to add all the subreddits I follow all over again. üòî
Its 5$ regular pricing.  For a water park with that many attendants, lifeguards, and rides is a freaking steal.  I think Shlitterbaughn is like 40$ a day.
You have to be able to *survive* the drive on Wurzbach and 35, first.  There's a reason my wife and I call it the Fury Road.
It's subsidized by the state. https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/e05ydz/this_dad_in_texas_a_true_bro/f8clvyq
And lose that sweet, sweet karma
On the bright side, if you get disabled in an accident on the way you'll get free admittance.

"""Today you. Tomorrow me."""
Good bros. Make sure to get your tire fixed. Spares like that are only good for limited miles.   Edit: also maybe have your bf run through changing a tire with you too. It's not that hard if someone's there to teach you and it's much easier if it doesn't feel like an emergency like it does when you're out on the road by yourself. 
Those are the cleanest Timberlands I have ever seen.
Just ya local Mexicans fixing flats. I've done it twice already for strangers lol
I make a point to stop every time I see someone stranded, especially when my kids are in the car with me.  I once had the opposite of this scenario - I drove by some amigos trying to jack up a large truck with a flat and I noticed stones piled on top of the jack.  It was too small to get the wheels off the ground.  I pulled over, and they spoke zero English, so we 'spoke' through hand gestures, but was able to let them know I can help.  Drove home, got my jack, drove back, and got their truck up high enough to change the tire.    They were all smiling, so grateful, patting me on the back...and pulled out a cooler to offer me a cold gatorade.    It feels good to help people.  
Tip: Loosen the nuts before jacking the car up. Use your foot instead of your hand as then you use your body weight to your advantage. This also prevents the tire from spinning as it would when you jack it up. 
be the goodness you want to see in the world
These are the sort of people who are *actually* making America great
Today you, tomorrow me....
I love this so much. If only we all lived by that motto, the world would be a better place!
Replying to the nicest comment giving me advice about changing a tire, thanks for the recommendation :)! To answer everyone else: 1) I (mostly) know how to change a tire, I just could not get the lug nuts to loosen; 2) the boyfriend is great, better than most men out there, he was just an hour drive away (he did offer to meet me to help change it and he was helping to make sure i changed it correctly); 3) AAA had a 2 hour wait and I needed to get to work; 4) it‚Äôs smaller because it‚Äôs my spare - I got a new tire that night. 5) these men were so helpful and a lot of people could learn from their kindness!
Yeah that man is risking messing up his timbs to help! Good dude
Truly saved my day! Undercover heroes! 
I‚Äôm not quite as persistent as you but any time I see someone trying to push a car I pull over ASAP and run over to assist. I‚Äôm a big dude that could probably push most 4 door sedans by myself so I feel like it‚Äôs the least I can do for my fellows.
r/HumanosSiendoCompas
> Tip: Loosen the nuts before jacking  I always do!
Not that tight. 80ft lbs is usually good unless it‚Äôs a truck. You can undo that with your hands. Super tight nuts/lugs bring other issues like stretched fasteners, warped disks, cracks, stripped threads, etc.  The guy changing tires usually doesn‚Äôt give a fuck and gives it 50 Ugga Duggas with the impact set to nuclear fusion
brb gonna start handing out handjobs at work 
Be careful with that.  A long time ago I started acting that way because I was sick and tired of being upset all the time.  If all you do is complain of course your gonna be miserable, right?  Well I started out donating blood and doing some local clean ups.  Because I was broke .  But it was a gateway drug.  5 years later I ended up becoming a volunteer firefighter.  So that shit gets out of hand.  One minute you're doing a good deed that costs no money because your broke and BLAM! [Next thing you're running into burning buildings with a bunch of like minded maniacs.](https://i.imgur.com/AkdLhqv.png)  EDIT:  Since this is a feel good sub.  Shameless plug for volunteer firefighters the world over.  70% of all US firefighters are volunteers.  We come from all walks of life.  If you want to help people there are few better ways.  Plus that shit is fun as hell!  Try it.  You'll see why we do this crazy shit for free.
Man that was great, thanks so much for posting a link to that. Kinda made me tear up. What a great motto to live by.
This gave me chills.
You should get a tire iron with a longer handle, or a tire iron extension.    Longer handle = more leverage.    [Example](https://i.imgur.com/2k0FUHq.jpg).

Gonna be a whole lot of windmills coming out of Southside Tattoo.
I've spent twice as much time covering crappy tattoos as I did getting crappy tattoos. Mostly gang related too.
Free tattoo removal is awesome. I think it‚Äôs really nice to give them a second chance. I have a few tattoos I obtained in the spirit of capricious youth that I wouldn‚Äôt mind covering but I can‚Äôt imagine having to bear the burden of something so publicly if you‚Äôve grown up.
I wonder what was so bad that they covered it with a swastika...

Happy to hear that
It's not tattoo removal, it's basically just using another tattoo to cover it up or alter it to be a different tattoo.   Like the swastika could become a windmill, or a square that's slightly off tilt, or even a circle.
2 swastikas
Get full-back swastika for $10.   Get full-back cover up.   Free $2,000 tattoo.   That logic is solid.
I'm honestly not sure if I'd rather be known as a Nazi or a Windows ME enthusiast.

Perhaps this is an unpopular opinion but I think it should be illegal for a tattoo artist to do a tattoo if the client isn‚Äôt sober.
fucking dirty wind power. we need more clean coal!
An apt metaphor for the reality that most of us spend more time repairing the mistakes we've made than we spend making the mistakes; but that's life.  Far from being ashamed, we ought to rejoice in both the affirmation of our capacity to change, as well as our ability to course-correct.   It's the worst of us who stick on one singular course their whole life out of fear and lack of imagination and stubborn unwillingness to change.  Nothing is so pitiable as a static, wooden man.  What a thrill, to know you have seen the depths of hate, anger and ignorance, and climbed *out* of those depths, become better, become something new.  Few of us choose hate; most of us have hate thrust upon us unwilling, and no one ought to feel ashamed of that.  It is done to us; we grow up seeing hate, feeling hate, being told to hate, and we are social beings; we do what we see, what we're told to do.  One may avoid such indoctrination when they're young only to have tragedy and trauma afflict them with it later in life, in one fashion or another. There is no shame in passing through that trial, in having that illness - for that is what hate is, an illness - there is only sadness for the ones who cannot escape and the highest of praise to those who do.  Those who overcome.  When I remodel a room in my house, I often feel a sense of loss and sadness when the room is finally finished.  It's much better than it was before, true; but the joy of building anew, the joy of the *process* of making something better than it was, of splaying out the infinite possibilities of change and alteration and having the infinite freedom of choosing a new direction - that is something people ought really to appreciate.  There is more joy in that, I think, than just in sitting in a very nice room.   And luckily, the best thing about us is that we are never finished; we always have room to improve, and the joy of that process needs never end until the final end.
The sky is the limit!
Most legitimate places won't tattoo drunk people. They don't want your blood to be too thin. Or maybe that's just a bs line they use. I was told not to drink at all before when I got mine, and so did a friend that I was with.

I am going to start working on this as soon as I can find my feet tomorrow morning.   I've made /r/micropromise (private for now)and some other folks have made other subs too.

There is some comfort knowing you‚Äôre not alone struggling with whatever is in front of you.  Especially those wanting, willing, and actively trying to help themselves and others.    My father, who loves the Lord of the Rings, used to say that Middle Earth would have been plunged into darkness if The Shire was filled with its current residents and not Frodo, would also fail if it were all Frodos, but would have found easier success if there were only a few more Samwises.    Surround yourself with positive and determined people and support others with positivity and determination.    Be well.

I do this for my SO every day. He has a hard time waking up to go to work (actually just waking up in general). I, on the other hand, am a morning person and I love my job so it‚Äôs usually not an issue to wake up and get ready. So some mornings he gets....physical motivation....but most mornings it‚Äôs just me telling him how much I appreciate that he goes to work to make money so we can [insert my current travel fantasy, which changes daily] someday. He is still pretty grumpy but as long as I keep a smile on my face and help him out as much as possible I really do think it makes a difference

Driving around in possession of a full Gram
10 minutes with a sweet looking old lady, bet she couldn‚Äôt wait to tell her old lady friends about her ride.
Me: I picked up this chick at the post office!  Friend: Was she a 10?  Me: Dude, she was a 94!
How nice! Some of the best conversations I've ever had have been with random older people who just strike up a conversation with me or say hi, usually at bus stops or on the train or something. They always seem to have interesting stories to tell and it's fascinating to listen to them, and they seem happy to tell them. It's heartwarming
Glad this worked out. Getting into the car with someone you just met at the post office is a very bad idea.
‚ÄúFuck it, I might smash.‚Äù‚ÄîBeverly
Whoever said picking up chicks in cars was hard?
And man was she loud
To be honest I think you'd get in more trouble with half a Gram in this situation
Lmfao, you know it. I bet it was a refreshing experience for the both of them :)
This is ridiculously cute. She's going to go back to her friends and tell them about the cutie she met at the Post Office!

My last car had a 2nd gentle honk I would use all the time, loved that thing. Pissed no one off and never got an aggressive reaction from it. Cut to a month ago after I bought a new car; honked at someone who almost hit my car. They pulled up next to me and tried to fight me at a red light [like if I had forced them to sit through this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf8GaX_lrL4). After ignoring him he spat at and then threw something at my car before running a red light resulting in him totaling his car and damaging 3 others. I miss my 2nd gentle honk.

Did you stay behind to help the police figure out what happened? It was probably obvious via basic forensics and enough evidence but on-scene dashcam footage is pretty open and shut for finding fault and assigning liability.
Yup. gave them everything they needed, even forwarded footage from a second angle the car behind me sent me when he found my video. 
I wish I thought of this while in uni.
We did this in my medical school. Made a massive google doc with people. We would then also insert jokes for fun or a way to help memorize a certain topic. We would even highlight points that the professor made sure we knew for the test!
"Google Docs is so nice and is great way to collectively study and share ideas/questions! Used it all the time in college! The only problem is a lot of times you have those shmucks who believe everything is a competition and refuse to partake or choose to ""leave out"" certain important information so that they can gain some sort of advantage over others. "
This is actually awesome, especially since I'm so slow at taking notes :/
Me and my friends do this, but it usually just dissolves into making jokes and fucking around. Useful for passing class time, at least.
It sounds nice, but I don't know how they could take notes simultaneously in the same document? Not from a technical point, I get how google doc works, but I imagine someone (even more someones, like ten people at the same time) writing similar sentences at the same time as I am? It would get so confusing. And other students seeing the parts that are confusing and explaining in real time? Then they'd miss the next part of the lecture, no?  Currently at Uni, and while it sounds really nice and I think google docs is great for group projects or fill in gaps in the script after the lecture, I can't imagine this working the way it is described. Has anybody here tried this?
Thanks I'll bring this up with my group project and a few classmates.  Might be useful.
"I bet there was one kid that didn't do the work on this ""group project"". "
I thought of this, but all of my friends are like ‚Äú sorry fam, but I haven't study yet‚Äù until the exams are over and they all got As. Welp
I wish I had solid hard working friends who could help me achieve this at uni. 
We did and it was incredible. We would take notes in group and divide tasks: Someone write, someone fix the layout, someone draw that schematics and someone proof read.  We even managed to keep up with some really fast professors who get out of room so quickly it was nearly impossible to get complete notes before they got erased.
Explaining in realtime with text while the lecture is ongoing? Yeah, that's not going to work as well you might think.
One of our mneumonics for the antebrachial muscles is ‚Äúeveryones a mother fucker except u‚Äù  Do you have any to share
I just experienced something like this last week. We were taking an exam and the prof had two different versions of it (50 multiple choice or 30 with some short answer). Turns out about half of the 50 multiple choice questions exams were missing multiple questions due to a misprint. Anyway we spent 30 mins next class figuring out how to fix the mistake so everything was ‚Äúfair.‚Äù You wouldn‚Äôt believe how many people got upset when our solution became ‚Äújust give everybody 100%‚Äù
I really want to do this, but all my math and science classes the professors are really strict about taking notes on paper, and no computers in class :|
We do this with facebook messenger, just a group chat with memes and making jokes.
More than likely there are assigned roles in the note taking.  One person might be able to type really fast, and just types the lecture. While others take other notes, like what is written on the board, or add other pertinent information.  Given the nature of the document being always online, others can add stuff later, and answer/pose questions.  I would imagine this document is a smaller group of students, or it is a smaller class, probably a higher level course as well, as the free loaders would be weeded out already.
More likely there's one kid who takes great notes and this is the ploy the others are using so they don't have to. 
I wish I have friends to do this in Uni. 
Truth is, college is partially a competition and if this really did happen it was an anomaly. There would be plenty of kids not contributing and coasting off of the team effort who didn‚Äôt deserve it. This is utopian or a very close group of a few friends. 
I am taking networking classes so what I have to share is for remembering the OSI model  Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away  Physical  Data-link  Network  Transport  Session  Presentation  Application
What happened in the end?
That's so fucking stupid I don't even know where to begin lmao
Do u lyk me?  Yes__     No__
I did this back in high school in a group of 6 in one of my history classes, we would assign sections to people. Everyone else would correct and add things to sections if needed. Questions can be asked via google docs comment feature. The bottom of the document was always for off topic stuff. We basically just used it so half of us could goof off and not pay attention knowing we had notes if needed. We didn't really have trouble rotating through note taking duties luckily.
I wish I have friends
Dude, it's so easy to find friends in college that I've seen furries with *groups* of friends. You're not worse than a furry. You can do this.
Come, let's get sunburned 
Uhhh how does that correlate to epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis?  Edit: Ooooh you mean the layers of the epidermis
We all got 100% thank goodness. The professor ended up saying something like ‚Äúif you *really* want the grade you got then just let me know.‚Äù Still couldn‚Äôt believe that people got upset over that...Jesus it‚Äôs a college level course just take the easy grade.
I mean the school‚Äôs intro science and math classes all suck dick.  Fucking college algebra test on quadratic equations had 18 problems with a -b, and the teacher only spent like 2 seconds on what to do with imaginary numbers.  And then none of the squares went out evenly. (Teacher made the test herself, it felt like she typed out random numbers).  Life Pro Tip: if a college is associated with a religion, a lot of the professors will have been picked because of their faith instead of credentials.  Edit: this doesn‚Äôt really make a difference 98% of the time, but the 2% really shines.
I wish
That's..... Oddly inspiring. Thank you. :) 
Imagine that, some people get upset when the hard work and effort they put into a grade gets devalued.
My experience with going to a religious college has the been the exact opposite. Almost all of my professors have been very helpful and good teachers. It depends on where you go, not that the university was ‚Äúreligious.‚Äù
I was a little bit taller.
Well they're in for a big surprise in the real world
Exactly. My hard work in my career is CONSTANTLY devalued. Best learn to accept it now while it's actually benefitting them.
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her

A friend of mine passed a few years ago and I still can‚Äôt bring myself to delete his texts.
I think the two of you just raised the bar for submissions here.
So sad for you but encouraged to see such a nice exchange between two very decent people. My condolences on the loss of your brother.
I‚Äôm sorry for your brother.
That‚Äôs beautiful! I still have my BIL in my contacts and he died in 2006. I‚Äôve never texted him though. I just stare at his contact card when I miss him.
I lost my dad on April 1st (still mad about that part) and had been doing the same thing. Someone texted back a few weeks ago, and they were kind but clearly didn't want to be bugged which I understand. But I can't bring myself to delete his number yet.
My vision is blurry now...
Someone has my dad‚Äôs number and I drunk dialed and cried to that stranger for so long.
I know it probably won't but I want so badly for this to end with the two of you falling in love and growing old together.
"I remember reding that Russell Crow said in an interview that he still has Heith Ledger's number in his phone because ""damn I miss that kid."""
My mum died in 2011. I've had 5 or 6 phones since then. Still have her number.
Never do.  And you know, you can keep them forever with an app like SMS Backup & Restore. Phone to phone, year to year, for as long as you like.
I totally agree. This post is legitimately wholesome, not forced, and what we need more of.
At least his number was reassigned to a saint of a person.
Yet there‚Äôs something really wonderful about never meeting at all.
My friend died a year or so ago. He‚Äôs not going anywhere. I don‚Äôt care if he doesn‚Äôt respond
Same here, same year. I also backed up a voicemail in voice memos on my laptop. I can‚Äôt listen to it though because she mentions how we haven‚Äôt talked in a few days while I was up at college. Awful.
I teared up.
One of my friends died two and a half years ago.  I sent him a Facebook message shortly after.  It was marked read, I believe because his (adopted) son saw it.  Every once in a while I send another quick note to my friend.  Sometimes just because I miss him, sometimes just so his son knows we all miss him.  I always worry that it's like ripping the bandaid off again for the son, but in the end remembering the love is always worth it.
I have the same problem. All my dead mom‚Äôs voicemails say things like ‚Äúhey, why haven‚Äôt you called me back?‚Äù I miss her like crazy and I wish I could call back now!!   Call your mom back, folks.
"Yep.  It's been 6 years since my dad passed and I have trouble going through emails he sent me.  My work email address just has a buried folder with all of them.      This post makes me think of that and how tough it is to ""hear"" his voice when I've read bits of them."
Watch this:  https://youtu.be/YB46h1koicQ  Turns out seems like people who have lost someone close to them want their loved one to be remembered by people besides themselves
Not trying to be a downer but forward those to a Gmail or something. At my company, the first thing they do before they show you the door is disable your email. I know I'd hate to lose something like that if it could be avoided.
"(didn't see the video)  It's very true.  My dear friend lost her baby last year, and I made her and her husband a memorial video out of the short videos they took of her short little life.  One of them included Mommy and a hospital volunteer singing Stevie Wonder's ""Isn't She Lovely?"" to baby, so that became the theme song of the entire video (I had them start it, and it faded into SW singing it throughout the rest of the video).  A few months back it played on the radio, so I sent her a text letting her know that I heard the song and thought of her baby, and she responded back saying she sometimes worried that people would forget about her baby.  I told her that there's at least one other person out there that thinks of her baby almost daily, and that's me."
I've got them backed up.  Good looking out though
My heart warmed at this ‚ù§Ô∏è
(I personally have been called on to help someone choose the right color sweater, adjust the thermostat accordingly, and help determine who sent a package. All wonderful experiences with people I wouldn‚Äôt have connected with otherwise!!!) 
I have had this app on my phone for approximately one year and in that time I have personally received five or maybe six calls for help. Only once did I not answer a call in time before another volunteer got to it. It‚Äôs a wonderful experience to be able to help somebody. I usually get calls from a gentleman who wants to know the denomination and years of various coins. My first call was helping someone set up the Wi-Fi on their laptop.
I have taken probably 15-20 calls since the app first came out....every single person I‚Äôve helped has been so thankful. Glad to see so many more volunteers. 
They‚Äôve just recruited another helper in me! Looking forward to helping out (hopefully!)
 My mom knows the creator of this app, and I have it too - dude's a great guy and it's an amazing concept!
I've actually had this app for over a year, had my first call last month! Had to help someone read their Daughters Birthday Party invite. Was very humbling. 10/10 get this app please.
I‚Äôve only gotten one call but it was a lot of fun. Guy was out of town and needed the hotel room service menu read. We chatted a bit; he was a super funny guy! Hope to take more calls. 
Joined. Do I sense a reddit hug coming on?
My brother is blind. He will be delighted learning about this!
I use this app as a volunteer. I‚Äôve only received one call and it was a gentleman who wanted to know if his dog had pooped in a highly trafficked area. It was amusing but I found the poop for him. 
Thank you for posting this.  The goodness of people never ceases to amaze me and the ability to leverage technology to help others is amazing.   I have signed up and now a volunteer.   
There are now 1,889,250 volunteers. Wow!!! I‚Äôm really glad people are into this idea. Warms my heart to see all the helpers! 
I had this app for awhile. I was never fast enough to answer the call when it came in. Now I see why. The volunteer number is huge in comparison. I‚Äôm glad to see so many are out there willing to help. 
It‚Äôs a wonderful app! A blind man video called me one day to ask me to explain the app to his new caregivers and also blind roommate. It was so neat!!
Do they sort requests by the type of help someone needs?  I dont have the best fashion sense, if someone called me asking which shirt looks best I would be worried about choosing wrong.  I feel like I would be able to help with more objective problems with 100% confidence though.
"Wow, this is si much of a ""Human Being Bros"" type thing! I joined and according to the stats I see on the app, you motivated over 400 people! What a wonderful community! "
PSA: If you speak more than one language - definitely sign up for this because I'm willing to bet they need people that speak things other than english.
I first fkund out about this app years ago when it was only available for iOS(android here), and was deeply upset i wasn't able to use it. I'd be checking every couple of weeks until i forgot about it... It's so great knowing they've made it so far! Just joined
I‚Äôve answered 4 calls with Be my Eyes!! It‚Äôs the best and I encourage everyone to do it.  Takes a little while to get your first notification, but it‚Äôs well worth the wait!  I‚Äôve helped people pick out dresses for special events, look at school work and notes their kids bring home, check mail and packages...feels so awesome to help out!
I am a Lyft driver and I assisted a blind passenger on getting home the other day and she was ranting and raving about this like no other. It made me so happy.. definitely have thought about giving this go. I love the idea for it. There is also the same concept but for deaf people and they have a translator that will FaceTime the deaf person and translate what the caller is saying. Unfortunately forgot the name of that one but it is great! 
Oh hey thanks Mods!!! I‚Äôm really glad I could get the word out about this great app, I really hope it takes off like it deserves to! 
OP, I had no idea how existed until now. Thank you for sharing, this is just incredible.
I have had this app for MONTHS and I have gotten two calls, and both were pleasant and wonderful experiences. One was checking the expiry on a cold medication bottle and the other was checking to see if they had a certain spice. 
Awww shit... downloaded the app, subscribed and I was scrolling through the comments as I wait for someone to call when I read yours and remember I'm color blind. Fuck.
OP Please, is it possibleto help through text/voice messages without *ACTUALYY* calling? 
"Until I read this comment my thoughts were ""what fucking idiot thought that made sense"", guess I'm the idiot."
Isn‚Äôt it such a great experience??? And it‚Äôs nice knowing that if you don‚Äôt pick up, someone will 
Wow thank you so much for doing it. It‚Äôs SO rewarding 
What kind of things do you do to help them?
Yes do it!!! You probably won‚Äôt get a call for a while but it‚Äôs really cool when you do! 
It's a really neat idea and I always have fun when called - most frequent it's to check expiration dates or ingredient labels. Makes you wonder what else we sighted people take for granted. 
Can you have her thank him? I know that‚Äôs weird but if she can I‚Äôd love for him to know how much I appreciate the concept!!! And I appreciate kind people who make life easier for others. 
Omg I love that show much!!! I bet that person was really excited to hear what the invitation said!!! 
Everyone I‚Äôve talked to has been AWESOME! 
I HOPE SO WOW
It's up about 10k volunteers since it was posted!
I‚Äôm so glad I was able to direct him towards it!!! Tell him that the volunteers are overwhelming the app so if he wants to sign up buddies he should! 
He wasn't lying when he said he can't see shit.  Edit: I got me some gold. Ain't that some shit. Thank you kind stranger!
Every time I open the app and see that number I tear up a little 
1,889,304 now... in 11 minutes 54 people joined.. this is awesome  
Nope! It‚Äôs literally just, ‚Äúhey I really want to wear a blue sweater, is this sweater blue?‚Äù   It‚Äôs really just little things like that. You‚Äôre not providing life advice or anything, you‚Äôre just helping them clarify things! 
I love that they didn't trust the kids to tell them what the school work and notes said. Like sure mom, it says A++++, no homework today or ever in fact.
I don‚Äôt remember where I found it (maybe twitter???) but it‚Äôs great!!! And they‚Äôll email you really fun stories every now and then. You‚Äôre welcome, feel free to pass it on! I made my mom and boyfriend download it :) 
Blind leading the blinder. 
It‚Äôs a video chat that you answer! You have to be able to see what they need help with and audibly respond in real time. I don‚Äôt think your end of the video chat pops up though, I think you only see their screen 
Failing to see the practicality in something does not make you an idiot. When your perspective changes to where you can understand a different point of view, see that practicality, and recognize it, you‚Äôve actually grown as a person.   Way to grow!
Yup! It‚Äôs just an all-around feel good app. I love that it exists. I just wish more people who needed it used it and that I received more calls to help!
Thank you for introducing us to this awesome app.
Mostly helping out with the spice shelf while cooking and narrating porn
~~omg this is great.  I know limited asl too AWESOME~~  I went full retard
I‚Äôve been a volunteer for a while, and have missed a few calls, one because I get caught off guard by the notification, and two because the calls are quick to be answered.   I got to answer my first one the other day! I helped a lady with instructions for making brownies! She was very nice, and I was happy I was able to help out. This is a very cool app. 
> Makes you wonder what else we sighted people take for granted.  Vision, I imagine. 
I got a call from a blind woman who could figure out    1. If her stove was one    2. If it was on how to turn it off    The stove had flat buttons instead of a dial or physical buttons. She said she smelled burning, but wasn‚Äôt sure.     The stove was on and I had to walk her through finding the right buttons. I realized a lot of the words I used as descriptions really didn‚Äôt mean much to her because she didn‚Äôt have context for it. I had to explain things as if I was the one feeling it. For example: there was a ridge around where the buttons were held and I had to explain what that would feel like so she knew she was in the right space.     I never realized how unfriendly modern stoves were to the blind.
Yes this. Please thank the guy on our behalf. I had this caller who was so thankful for this app. Please pass on the message. 
"This looks so cool. Are the calls random?! Do you get ""regulars""?? "
That's a relief. I think I'll sign up.  Thank you.
YouTube Channel sixblindkids
Who cares if your video pops up, like they cant see you anyways.
Same!!!! Hopefully we can put some more awareness out there because it‚Äôs a great use of technology 
"""Yeah he's thrusting pretty good. She's not very convincing though, she looks a lot like Tiffany Amber Thiessen from Saved by the Bell. Woops, there goes her bra."""
ASL? For the blind? 
The calls are totally random so no regulars sadly. But on the plus side, you get to help so many more people! 
lol  - i almost died because i was in mid-drink. 
I‚Äôm hijacking here, my husband is legally blind (zero vision in one eye and very little in the other, with very little perception of color) and that stubborn fucker doesn‚Äôt ask for help enough, but I am over the moon to see all of the love and eagerness to help.  Thank you, sincerely.  Vision issues can make people feel very...alone.  This makes me feel the opposite of that.  We got him signed up, he actually really is happy and excited about the idea.  It helped quite a bit that I was able to tell him how stoked everyone on Reddit was to help.  THANK YOU!  :)
ah fuck i'm retarded 
Can you please tell him that it‚Äôs a joy to help? Please. I suffer from really severe depression and I often feel guilty about not doing enough to help others (hard to do volunteer work when you can‚Äôt drag yourself out of bed) and the chance to do little things like this really helps me. Everyone has SOMETHING, there‚Äôs no shame in asking for help and if it helps others...even better. 
I hope you are getting treatment for your depression and that things get a little better for you soon. I have severe depression too so I get it 
I am! I‚Äôm gonna be okay, I just have to be gentle with myself. And you too. Show yourself some mercy, it‚Äôs not easy to live in a brain that wants to harm you. 
Brake light switch. Fairly simple to replace. Even if it doesn't work it's easy to do. 
Had similar experience several years ago.  I was driving on I-40 heading to Knoxville from North Carolina and my car's alternator belt blew. I was stranded in the middle of nowhere and this was before cell phones were a thing.  I waved to passing truckers to call for help and pretty soon, a cop shows up.  We talk for a few minutes and explain that I'm a poor student on my way back to college.  He gives me a ride to the next exit to find a repair shop.  He talked to them and when he heard what they would charge, he paid for a new belt and we got back in his car and drove back. Side note: this part was great. We were flying down the interstate! We get to talking and tell him my father is a retired policeman. It's getting dark at this point. On the side of the interstate, he busts out his personal toolbox he keeps in his patrol car and fixes my car under the flood lights on his car.  Once I'm up and running again, I asked for his info so I could send him some money for the belt and help. He refused and gave me a patch from his department.  All he asked was that I mail him one from my father's department in return.  Greatest guy ever.  I'll never forget that. I wish more people could experience police in this way.  Most of them are.
Was he able to fix it?
The epitome of to protect and **serve**
Sometimes I wanna be a cop so I can just do cool helpful shit for people and give cops a better name.
Thanks for sharing, world needs more stories like this!
Got consent to search the trunk and the hood without a hassle!  Seriously though, good on him for lending a hand.
If the good cop is this good, I am really scared to see the bad cop.   EDIT: Getting downvoted for making a silly joke. Guess humans on reddit aren't being bros today.
This is a nice break from all the hate against cops on social media nowadays. I‚Äôd like to see more posts like this. 
But did she make it to her interview?
$600 seems mental though, right?   Edit: am foreign 
Did you mail him one?
I love stories like this. However, halfway through I get nervous and start peeking towards the end to see if mankind is going through the announcers table again.
This article says he fixed it:       >Having a background in mechanics, he quickly checked the connections on the tail lights, and then looked under the bonnet at the relay box, where he found the problem. In just a few moments, Jenkins had Thacker safely back on the road, on her way to her job interview.      https://thefreethoughtproject.com/cops-stop-woman-broken-tail-lights/
I saw a Highway Patrolman last night helping a rather distressed looking young man put his doughnut tire on.   Not all LEOs are pricks. 
I'm trying to become a cop for this exact reason.
I got pulled over on Sunday for an expired registration. My mom cosigned on the car with me, so all the relevant mail is in her name. Unfortunately, she has a habit of throwing mail away when she doesn't know what it is, instead of you know, opening it. So she threw away the letter reminding us to renew.  Aanyways, the officer could've just had me towed in the rain, but instead she walked me step by step on how to renew a registration on my phone. Super patient about the whole thing.
Happens a lot.  Overcharging for lack of knowledge. Had a buddy that was going to pay $150 to replace a headlight. Sent him to the store and told him how to look up what he needs. $20 later he shows up with a little box and doesn't think it's right. Took two minutes to change it out and he was good to go.
Yes, I did.  It was the least I could do.
Asking the real questions.
This was a cliffhanger for working men.
But all GEMINIs are for sure.
Protect and serve was viewed as a verbal legal loophole. Good cops are still good and the mission statement of most departments is still to keep the public safe.
I took my wife's car into the Ford dealer because it was basically dead.  They told me the alternator was dying and it was going to cost $800 to replace.   I found a refurbished one for $100 bucks and watched youtube to install it myself.  Took me an hour to do.  
Yeah, it‚Äôs not really ‚Äúsad.‚Äù What‚Äôs sad is how many Redditors pretend they know what they‚Äôre talking.   They‚Äôre not legally required to protect you, and that is for a valid legal reason a lot of people do not understand. It creates a hazardous precedent of unnecessary lawsuits. Example: Police respond to an active shooter in a shopping mall, they hear where the gunfire is coming from and respond. You‚Äôre sitting in the corner with a bullet in your leg crying and asking for help, but their main goal is to stop the threat before more victims pile up so they walk past you. If they were legally required to protect you, you would then claim they were negligent and attempt to file a lawsuit. In reality pertaining to public safety and law enforcement, you were not important then because more people were likely getting shot. That‚Äôs an extreme example but here's a more realistic one: all of the city's officers are tied up on high priority calls and you call 911 to report a large tire in the roadway. That is indeed a traffic hazard that needs addressed, but unfortunately at the moment it won't happen because they're busy dealing with some dude who beat the shit out of his wife and another guy who has two felony warrants. Five minutes later it causes a fatal accident and then the family of the deceased driver will attempt to sue the police department for not protecting them. Let's make it more realistic: you call 911 on somebody who was being belligerent in your mom n' pop ice cream shop. In the three-five minutes it takes the police to get there (which is a great response time), he punches you and breaks your nose. You make the argument that the police didn't respond fast enough and it was their fault you have a broken nose, you take them to court. Even the legal system realizes that it's physically impossible for the police to protect everybody in all circumstances. It just isn't realistic.  Well, what else is the big deal? The city pays for that attorney to represent the police department. If this happened all the time for every event people (especially the same folks complaining about how they‚Äôre not required to protect you) would be bitching about their tax dollars being spent on court appearances for cops. Not to mention a lot of cities are underfunded as it is.  The other thing is that the police protects and serves society as a whole, not individuals or ‚Äúyou.‚Äù  That kind of makes me think, though. They‚Äôre not required to protect you, but they choose to do so anyways and that can be observed over and over again. The city is not required to fix that pothole but if they‚Äôre going to get money to do so and feel like making your life easier they will. Not the soundest analogy but it makes my point.
That's soon to be Officer u/PM_NUDES_DOG_PICS to you!    ;)
Be the change you want to see!
"Yeah it's amazing how much knowledge is on YouTube. I've become a ""car guy"" by watching YouTube videos. So far I've replaced timing belts, rebuilt suspension, rebuilt top half of engine, and many smaller tasks. It's crazy how much info is out there, you just gotta find the time and tools."
Shoutouts to Chrisfix. His tutorials are extremely thorough and easy to follow. That being said, it's a good idea to find a vehicle specific video as well.
Hey guys! Chrisfix here, and today I'm going to show you how to fix your failing marriage using simple hand tools.
I tried spraying my wife with soapy wooder and she got mad.
Make sure you wear your mask that I linked in the description before continuing with this marriage fixing method. 
This man is my old boss. He‚Äôs one of the most generous, kind-hearted souls you‚Äôll ever meet. My father and him grew up together and have been working in tandem ever since.   I was at my parents home on Labor Day helping them prepare for the storm when he and my dad were on the phone hashing out the details about going to Costco on Wednesday morning to buy the generators to send to the Bahamas. I‚Äôm proud to have this man in my neighborhood. He doesn‚Äôt want to be named as he doesn‚Äôt want glory from this - he just wants to help however he can.
finally a nice story about florida man.
The Florida Man we all want to hear about. Good job, Florida Man.
Florida man caught in bahamas selling generators for 3500$ each. - Cnn
I swear every headline that starts with ‚ÄúFlorida Man‚Äù is wild.
This man might be saving hundreds of lives. Freaking hero!!  His name should be plastered all over the Internet.
How much is he selling them for over there? /s
The Florida man we all need.
This is the exact crap my dad wears when he's in Florida...glasses on head with a strap, weird shirt that has some breathy gap in the back, cell phone...except I don't see a belt clip, and usually a pair of Sperry-type shoes.
Get this to the top. Especially for the negative Nancy's saying he's trying to turn a profit.
Just give him a firm handshake from all of us and a thank you.
">	I was at my parents home on Labor Day helping them prepare for the storm when he and my dad were on the phone hashing out the details about going to Costco on Wednesday morning to buy the generators to send to the Bahamas.   Sounds like your father is also involved in making this happen. If so they are outstanding people and thank them both for us."
Hold up, what's the catch here...
Wholesome Florida Man is best Florida Man
They live life to its fullest in Florida.
It is..   Florida Man!
Buy $450k worth of generator and send them out for free..  Internet:. Look at the guy trying to turn a profit!!  Fuck my life.  Edit: just realised I can't do basic math.  Fuck my life again!!  Thank you kind stranger for the silver.  May your tap water always taste like delicious Swedish Alpine spring water and may you never walk thru the web of a spider in the dark
I already called my mom and told her that this made it to the front page and she was overjoyed with the news. She said she will be relaying to both of them the kind words everyone has been saying :)
Each box was shipped with a gator taped to it.
$45,000... Still fantastic though.
Genegator
Plus an assumed 7.00% tax. I don't know where the Costco is. Grand Total is $48,150
The supplies were trucked down from Jacksonville to Stuart, FL. Then a massive network of boaters and charters that are local in Florida and the Bahamas are donating their time & gas to personally take the supplies over. Everyone is all friends here and is not doing this for personal gain - they want to help their neighbors and families.
Gatorator
Thank you!
What about shipping? Or do you guess the recipients would cover that?
Shipping not included because I do not have knowledge on the cost to ship 100 generators.
"I'm gonna put it in the ballpark of ""more than I could afford even without the generators first."""
Or alternatively: 3 children beat up a man and threw him into a pool
"""You don't have to try so hard. You were definitely getting laid tonight anyways."""
Second photo could be an ad for a suit company. ‚ÄòSuits for your special groom/hero‚Äô. Looks great wet!  What a wonderful way to start the rest of your life than saving someone else‚Äôs. So special!!
That's pretty badass

Teach your kids to swim!
Just in case you needed a sign to marry him still lol
‚ÄúHey kid, here‚Äôs 20 bucks go pretend you can‚Äôt swim‚Äù
‚ÄúGet the hell out of the pool, it‚Äôs adult swim time‚Äù
The only thing worse than having a soggy suit in your photo shoot is having a few police and a dead kid being loaded onto an ambulance in the background.
Oh fuck my keys
on the day of my first wedding, we buried one of our closest friends. My ex just knew this would jinx the marriage. she was such a pessimist. 
Best wedding photo ever. He's rising out of that water like a goddamn Avenger
I present another alternative: groom pays local hobo to throw boy in pool so he can be caught on camera rescuing him and earn points with the new missus and her family. 
My wife and I were so exhausted we just knocked one out for traditions sake and went to sleep.

Haha he was so embarassed to tell the whole goddamn country that he had a Harry Potter themed wedding!
it's Rob Lowe
Ellen - People are calling you a hero, do you feel like a hero ?  Guy - I really cant say... but yes 
What a humble couple! You can tell they are genuine as fuck! 
Why do I keep hearing about Ellen so much lately?  She's on my Cheerio's box, I saw her on /r/ProjectFi because of a giveaway, I've seen her mentioned elsewhere a few times recently, and again here.  What's going on?!
And your grooms just in case
Fence the pool!  Lock the gate!  Teach your kids to swim,  it's great!  Supervise!  Watch your mate,  And learn how to resuscitate!   Lovely little song that plays on TV all over my country, covers the basics of water safety
He can swim, cares more about humans then clothes, and isn't racist.   The tripple threat.
It‚Äôs a test. If she gets mad at you for ruining the photo shoot you call it off immediately, ‚Äòcuz now you know.
Hol up
Or the groom is still on acid from the stag night and tried to baptise the kid.
I know for a FACT that when I get married sex is off the table. I don‚Äôt like being the center of attention, and I don‚Äôt like parties. Both happening at the same time might make me collapse into a singularity.   Edit: obviously I meant sex that night. 
Ruined for the day but I bet it could be cleaned and you‚Äôd never know, provided it‚Äôs taken care of in a reasonable timeframe.

You could tell both of them were actually big fans too because while she was starting to react way more when the passes were handed over he got the same look in his eye at the mention of the London bit.

My wife and I waited until after we were married, primarily because we were young and stupid. And then on our wedding night we were both too exhausted to try it. I must be one of the few men in history to have gone to sleep a married virgin.
If it makes you feel any better, you‚Äôll probably never get married.

I mean think about all the gay dudes who live / lived in time periods and regions and cultures where homosexuality is viewed as some crazy high crime, up to being punishable by death.  Think about all the guys brought up in super conservative or religious communities who probably had anxiety attacks or other perfectly normal issues and weren't able to perform.  Think about all the times a bride and groom probably had a fight on their big night.  Or all the times something went horrifically wrong and the wedding was broken off during the reception.  You're probably not as alone as you think. History is a long time.

Dont talk about my theoretical wife like that 
After my friend married his trashy fiance, she immediately went looking for one of our other friends to fuck on her wedding night...
The¬†best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second¬†best time¬†is now.
Finally doing something besides selling cookies and making me fat
it would be so cool to be one of them and see the trees now
That's an oddly specific number of girl scout trees to plant.
why dont water bombers carry seeds in the water that they drop? i mean they are gonna need to plant them anyways and why not now that the soil will be filled w minerals and ash
There used to be one in my hometown planted by the boy scouts. It got bulldozed for houses. There one day and gone the next.
A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.
Sorry to break it to you, but those look like peanut butter cookie trees.
It‚Äôs a great feeling,I planted a few hundred while I was in Scouts and although I can‚Äôt remember exactly where all the seedlings were placed  I hope one day my children will enjoy the shade they can provide one day
Cause they usually skim the lake to refill and plus, fire promotes growth in most circumstances. The seeds are there already. Some seeds actually need fire to germinate.
And conversely, a society declines when old men cut down trees whose consequences they'll never feel (but their children and grandchildren will). This is the society we currently live in, sadly.

Little dude is trying so hard to keep it together. 
"Took my 18yr old and 13yr old sons to see Metallica last year. The oldest (big kid, plays college rugby) jumps in the mosh pit. The youngest begs to join his brother. Less than a minute later, the youngest comes back, ""Ok, so that was a mistake. I'll try again when I grow up."" Good call, son."
It makes me kind of sad to remember the age when I was that passionate about things
James Hetfield lives in my town. He‚Äôs always more than happy to take pictures and chat it up with fans. It‚Äôs so great to see celebrities like that  EDIT: he LIVED in my town until 4 years ago. 
This is too goddamn pure for my sinful eyes
"I think there are two ""humans being Bros"" cases here. The band member fist bumping the kid is the one everyone is focusing on.   But, look at the dad. He's taken the time to spend with his son, doing something that they share in common. How many dad's and kids this age are off doing things together.    But, when James (?) Starts coming towards him, the dad is directing his attention to the son, not himself. And you can see the genuine happiness he has, not because what he got, but because his son experienced something meaningful and special.   That's a dad I can respect - and one his son will hopefully appreciate for years to come.   Edit: typos"
I‚Äôd love to experience that level of happiness. 
Dave Grohl in the back eattin it up.
You think that's kids just overwhelmed with excitement, but if you watch the video with sounds James Hetfield actually shouts 'We're doing St. Anger 2' as he passes. The poor kids just trying to keep it together and not focus on the sound of that fucking snare drum.
I can sit and reminisce about when I was excited as a child, but honestly as a Dad now watching my young get excited brings me more pure joy than anything I have ever experienced in my life. This video brings me joy for this kid, and for his Dad.
I took my son to see Metallica when he was 12, when they came on he was stood absolutely rigid with excitement, it was amazing!
Hit this 32 year old metalhead right in the feels
My kidds lullabys are Black album. He will be well adjusted adult... Right? 
I'm not crying....ur crying.. now I'm happy crying for a kid I dont even know. 
I'm confused. Is he crying because he was ignored or because he was noticed?  I thought it was the former and I kept waiting for the happy ending. 
That kid *really* loves his dad a lot.
Good for him for trying tho!! That's awesome!
"When I was younger and stupider I wanted to join a mosh pit SO BAD (I'm a girl, 4'11"" and had no self preservation whatsoever). Then in a local show I got an elbow to the face by standing too close to the pit and learned my lesson lol"
Reminds me of when I took my nine-year-old nephew to see the second Hunger Games movie. it was rated M, and his mum had given permission for him to see it (he'd read the books already too).   It was his first time seeing an M rated movie, and I had told him that if it was too scary he could let me know and we'd leave whenever he wanted. There was a swear word in the film and he was amazed ('Did they say a bad word?!?' LOL).  But near the end, during a 'scary' bit, he got too scared and asked to leave, so we did. As we were heading back to the car he says 'I think I'll just stick to PG from now on'. Bless. So adorable.
Same, I miss being passionate about Runescape
It makes me happy that I still get that passionate about things.
I live in the same town as Robert Plant, same sort of guy. Goes to open mic nights a lot!
I saw James at the AA Terminal at LAX a couple years ago, the spiderweb tattoo on his elbow caught my eye and I realized it was him. He was waiting for his flight alongside his Wife and Daughter and as badly as I wanted to go up to him to say hi and ask for a pic, I didn't want to be the guy that notices somebody famous others aren't aware about, but are now bothering him because he is famous. Needless to say I left him and his family alone and I've yet to live it down.
You're not crying, I'm crying.
The part that always gets me is how much he's supporting the kid during all these; filming the entire thing and comforting him. When he kisses the back of his kids head while he's trying to stay composed is what really gets me.
The dad in this video had me more emotional than the kid because sure, kids get excited and this case was absolutely heartwarming, but that dad is clearly just so happy for his son to be happy and it makes me want to ugly cry. 
"It's beautiful.   When I was about the same age my big brother took me to my first concert. He bought a rose from a vendor and tried to convince me to walk up to the stage with it. I was scared to death, sure I was going to get arrested or something. After a lotta pump up talk from him, I gathered my courage and started walking down the aisle.  He told me that he couldn't go with me because security would stop him, but not a young girl. I looked back and he was standing in the aisle just watching. The guards closest to the stage told me I could lay it on the stage but couldn't give it to any band members. I set it down, turned around and literally ran back to my brother. He grabbed me in the biggest hug and was screaming, ""Did you see that?!? He was trying to say thank you!!""  Apparently, as soon as I turned to run, Randy Owen picked up the rose while singing and held it out pointing to me, the lone little kid running in the auditorium. I missed it.  He said the crowd went pretty wild, but I didn't hear anything but my heartbeat.   All that's to say, it wouldn't have mattered if I'd seen it or not, the best part of the memory is how much my brother wanted to see me happy and how he boosted my courage to get there. Awesome night. "
Go to a Metallica concert
I assume he'll sleep with one eye open, gripping his pillow tight.
If you look closely the band member gives him a fist bump. 
He is crying from happiness. Definitely. As an avid concert goer, I have a few cry meltdown stories myself. 
He‚Äôs overwhelmed with awe.  I managed to grab Slash‚Äôs guitar pick at a show in 1993, when he threw it out into the crowd. He was my #1 idol at the time. I literally burst into tears. I still have it. I‚Äôve since used it at my own shows. 
He is emotional for getting to see his favorite band and getting a fist bump, but I'd guess his dad was his favorite person in the world that day.
His dad really loves him. You can tell he wants to give him a full on head nuzzlekiss but can‚Äôt embarrass him in front of goddamn Metallica so he holds back. 
"Not only trying, but coming back and instead of having a negative feeling about the experience, he was like, ""I think I'll come back to that when I'm ready""."
Tbf, some of the most vicious people I've seen in a mosh pit are tiny ladies.
Same, I miss having a dad
"I have a plant on my desk. I had a contest with my supervisees to give it a name.  You guessed it. They named the plant, ""Robert."""
be 13
Ohh hey, look at that. Thanks. 
Well they were mouthing James, so it was likely Hetfield. If Lars was the one that fist bumped him he may have been crying tears of disappointment. 
I totally didn't notice the fist bump at first. I had to go back and rewatch it after reading your comment.
I'm guessing if his dad loved Teletubbies and they were at a Teletubbies concert and Tinky Winky noticed them then he'd be just as emotional.
Atta boy!
I guess I'm glad I don't remember what having one is like?
You are welcome. I had to do a double take üòä. 
"I love those kinds of pits. At a punk show, when I  was teen, a big dude noticed me getting trampled after some guy tripped me and he yelled ""girl down!"" Then swept his arms out and pushed people out of the way so could part a small section and he grab my hand. That dude yanked me up with so much strength that I caught air and he had to catch me. Once he saw I was stable and smiling we carried on moshing. I never got the chance to thank him, but I'm sure he knew."
Yeah it took me five takes but
Exactly like Runescape.
My and my gf foster dogs. This last year we had like 5 of them and all of them shared the same thing: they loved to be cover with a blanket. You can be sure this one was really grateful for that scarf.
That poor cold pup might be laying close to the door to get a little heat. What an amazing human! So many people would have just walked past. Hopefully someone recognizes her so the internet can get her a few new scarves. 
I would be terrible in a country with so many stray dogs. I know it‚Äôs not possible, but no dog deserves to live on the streets. Is it weird to have more sympathy for animals than humans?
Kinda sucks that the poor doggo cannot take the scarf with him. 
there this, then theres that old woman stealing a blanket from a stray cat and still dares to smack it. smh. good on the woman in this gif! kind soul.  link for the curious: https://www.reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/comments/a3orc2/lady_steals_a_stray_cats_blanket_just_after/?utm_source=reddit-android
This breaks my heart. I don't think there's any way I could leave without that dog.
I'm crying I hope the owner is just in the store 
Turkish people strike again!
I‚Äôve learned this while in college, where everyone is broke, that the people with so little give so much.   She may only be able to give this dog a little piece of clothing, but to the dog that meant the world and is exactly what he needed in that moment of time. It‚Äôs nice to think that a single act of kindness like this, so genuine and pure, can inspire others to do the same. I know the dog can‚Äôt talk, but I like to think that this video was posted in the hopes to help others see that no kind act goes unforgotten.   Maybe I‚Äôm on a soap box this morning and am reading too much into this like my old English teacher, but I recall a time I felt alone like that dog, in a world that didn‚Äôt care about me. Metaphorically, I felt that constant rain cloud over me too. It just took my now ex, one moment of,‚ÄùIt‚Äôs going to be okay‚Äù or my friends one second to text me and go,‚ÄùDo you want to grab lunch?‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt have to feel alone or without any love in the world. I‚Äôm glad I get to start my 2019 with this video and to be reminded now that I‚Äôm better, to give a ‚Äúlittle scarf‚Äù to someone in need today. It only take a moment to change how someone feels. It‚Äôs free, to be kind & caring and free to help others who are struggling. 
Turkish people Love their strays!
We adopted a dog awhile back and he loves to be covered with blankets. Only dog I've ever had that did.
And maybe get that pupper a nice forever home while we are at it
I kinda hope they dont.  Her act was ... completely selfless  She didnt even pause long enough to get the dogs approval.  Her faceless makes it just a bit more pure.
I‚Äôve noticed in some countries I‚Äôve visited that residents seem to collectively look out for stray dogs and cats. I‚Äôm talking about pretty poor places, too. 
Not weird. Humans know the difference between right and wrong and still choose the latter at certain times. Animals aren't malicious and don't have a way to speak for themselves. I fully agree with your statement.
> Is it weird to have more sympathy for animals than humans?  This question always reminds me of Byron's epitaph for his dog;   > Near this Spot  >are deposited the Remains of one  >who possessed Beauty without Vanity,  >Strength without Insolence,  >Courage without Ferocity,  >and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.     >This praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery  >if inscribed over human Ashes,  >is but a just tribute to the Memory of  >Boatswain, a Dog  >who was born in Newfoundland May 1803  >and died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808
TIL what a carboy is. A¬†carboy¬†(or¬†carbuoy),¬†demijohn, or¬†jimmyjohn¬†is a rigid container with a typical capacity of 20 to 60 litres (5 to 16¬†US¬†gal). Neat.
I love what a Turkey does with their stray cats. Saw a lot of happy and content strays on the streets of Istanbul. 
Why not?  He/she could just bunch it up in its mouth and carry it all over.
Well that made me sad.  Poor thing.   We just rescued a cat that was dumped in a farm field.   Cat stayed in the same spot for 4 days in freezing temps.  I thought it was odd it was in the same spot.   My wife got out after we ran some errands.   It wanted to run from her but didn‚Äôt have the energy.  Got in the car, and went straight to the spare food we keep in the car.  The vet noticed all of its cuts and scrapes.  Thinks it was tossed out of a moving vehicle.  I now have 5 rescued cats....  
If you were broke as shit and there were hundreds of strays in the area you lived in, yes, there is a way you could leave without the dog.
My dog will stand beside his bed and look at us and back to his bed over and over until we hold up the blanket for him to get underneath.
I want this more than the scarf. 
It‚Äôs cultural. By contrast, in some villages in Central America they will occasionally put out poison to control the population.
It can but it's dog and probably won't. It'll very likely be left on the ground but I feel that adds to the good human factor of this video. 
shit, tossed out of a **moving** vehicle? for real? smfh.  good on you my man, for saving that cat and saving the other 4. you're a kind person. keep it up üëçüëç
Since its Turkey its almost a certainty that dog is well taken care of by the local people there. He is just chilly but good chance the little guy has a full belly.
My dogs do this, but on our bed!  They will scratch at the top edge and then look at me until I lift it up.  Then they cuddle up against me under the covers until they get too hot and come out.  I love it!  Only me though, not my husband.  He gets sad.
Well the scarf wasn't for you anyway! Lol
Studied abroad in turkey and almost got attacked by a group of feral dogs until a Turkish man with long hair came up and started barking at the dogs. He said in broken English ‚Äúbark loud, dogs run‚Äù. If you read this, I thank you kind sir. 
"Well, there's a logical and reasonable limit. In rural areas where dogs get dumped a lot if the population rises high enough they start forming packs that attack pets, small livestock and even children. There are some places so afraid of this they have no tolerance for strays, but most places have a ""I think we're starting to get too many"" sort of mentality."
Well the difference is if you would call them stray dogs, or wild dogs. Wild dogs will eat your face given the chance. 
In The Appalachia mountains it‚Äôs not uncommon for people to not fix their pets, let them have pups/kittens and then leave them out in the cold or tie them in a bag and toss it in a river...  it‚Äôs awful... 
I guess he could lay on top of it on the same spot too which would probably be even better in regards to insulation.   But yeah, it was pretty selfless, she just gave up on her scarf so the dog could have a little bit more comfort.
Probably the same as in Greece - they tag em, immunize them, neuter them then turn them loose rather than slaughter them in shelters. Seems more humane to me. 
My dog did this as well, as soon as I'd lift the blanket she'd bolt under the covers, curl up between my legs and use my butt as a pillow since I sleep on my stomach. My ex got her in the breakup and for a while I'd put a pillow between my legs when I slept because I missed her.
Maybe he had a childhood dog that did this. I did, he was the best. We were like some sort of Huck Finn dynamic duo of running around like pork chops, farting, and being generally rambunctious 
Yeah, someone misunderstood the post. We're not out here giving out free scarves to every harry, dick, and tom.
Thanks for the advice! My next dog will be a rescue but I'm holding off for a bit. Letting my ex have the dog was my decision because at the time of our breakup I was steering hard into addiction, knew it was going to get exponentially worse after the breakup, and was afraid that if I ended up dead that my dog wouldn't be cared for since I'd be living alone. As much as I miss her I am glad I had enough of a sound mind to let her go at that time.  3 years later and I'm in a much better place and VERY excited to get a dog again.
Think this is the second time I've seen this judge pop up on Reddit for having a just heart of gold. If only more human beings were like this!
Please be Judge Caprio...opens post...Yep, good old Judge Caprio. He's such a good man
We need more judges like this
Will someone in Rhode Island please help this man & his son out with transportation? If I lived there, I‚Äôd do it in a heartbeat.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a video of this guy NOT letting someone off the hook lol
Why isn't this guy a Supreme Court Judge?
Why the hell didn't the police just let him off in the first place
"I'm all for the case being dismissed if it was clearly a minor violation that didn't deserve whatever punishment could have been carried out. But just because you're old and doing something extremely kind for someone doesn't mean he wasn't potentially speeding. Old people cause serious accidents all the time. Getting a slap on the wrist because you're old only puts more people at risk. Not trying to be a dick, but imagine anyone else saying ""I dont speed, and I don't drive much"" as their defense. I wasn't there when he got a ticket or in that courtroom, so if that's what the judge says is fair, game on. But old people getting off the hook because they're old is terrifying to me."
That 96 year old man with a head full of hair and here I am at 34 and bald, god damned genes man I tell you.
Kinda sad, that old ass man drives and probably puts others in danger because his son can‚Äôt get proper help.. It really is what ‚ÄúAmerica is all about‚Äù.
Sweet as it was. (And it was) Old mate needs a driver for him. To assist him in caring for his son.  As loving and caring as the situation is- a mishap could kill a school child - how awesome if he was able to have a driver come in once a week and take him to appointments and stuff.
This is not human being bros, even if he's old, dude was clocked going way too fast and putting other people and their familyin danger. This is what's fucked up with America, why is he having to drive his 63 year old son to cancer treatments? That should never be a thing.
This judge understands that the legal system is about fairness and justice and not about strict adherence to the law, it's what judges are for.
Judge Frank Caprio. Whenever i want some faith restored in our bleak judicial system, I watch him. He‚Äôs a saint this man. I often wish for more judges like him to take stand and show at least a shred of the humanity that this man has.
Omg, the old mans lip is quivering, I was praying he was not going to cry. I don't think he got the joke about the judge and his son, poor guy and obviously despite his age a great dad. We have all volunteer run drop to the hospital for treatment for I'll patients with cancer etc. It works well especially if travelling a good distance
If you have [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/caughtinprovidence/),  he's there too. They also have [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CaughtInProvidence) and a [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CaughtinProvidence/) .  I do know they have a TV show too but I'm not quite sure what channel.
It‚Äôs always Judge Caprio.  Not saying that he‚Äôs the only good judge out there, but he‚Äôs definitely gotten a lot of exposure over the past couple of years.
They‚Äôre out there. They just don‚Äôt get the headlines. I feel like this is the same judge who dismissed a case against a veteran too. He looks familiar.
Seriously. The thought of this man having to take care of his ill son at 96 makes my heart break. Not only is he in pain watching his own son suffer but he has to put himself and others in danger at his age to get him to the damn doctor.
‚ÄúHm yes you committed manslaughter by putting 14 bear traps in the forest without a hunting liscense and managed to kill a toddler playing at the nearby playground with one, But, your son is terminally ill so i‚Äôll let you off the hoom,‚Äù  /s But seriously speeding in a school zone is bad. I hope he wasn‚Äôt going to fast. This judge I think just has more humanity than like 90% of them out there.
He‚Äôs not a rapist
Being old doesn't make it legal to speed through school zones...
Speeding in a school zone is bad business, no matter who is driving.  The officer did the right thing.
I agree with your point that the rule is there for a reason and should be enforced.   I believe that‚Äôs why the ticket was given.   A judge‚Äôs job is to use discretion and that particular guy was obviously taking it very seriously.He couldn‚Äôt express himself well but I don‚Äôt believe there is any chance of him taking it lightly and continuing to speed In the future.  He‚Äôs at the end of his life trying to do his best for his family until his last day.   Personally I couldn‚Äôt given him a fine either
Do 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 squats and 10km running every day for 3 years, and then at least you'll have a good excuse for being bald.
You know, I don't find it all that inspiring when a handicapped person with cancer is dependent on their 96 year old father to get his treatment.
I love the consideration he takes for people's situations. A lot of judges just see the offence and send it through but he takes the time to see what's going on.
He's the ultimate bro and an excellent example of how judges should behave.
I've delivered mail to this man at christmas time and he leaves out a full gift basket of full bottles of soda and snacks for not only mailmen but also ups and fedex aswell. Truly a great man
I thought that at first as well, but he is in his 90‚Äôs. I think he just has tremors because of his age/fatigue. This was very touching. This man was in his 20‚Äôs during world war 2 and still drives his 60 year old son to cancer treatment.
I think what makes him special, even over other judges with a kind heart, is that he seems to really care about the people he's talking to. He could have easily dismissed that case, and we'd still think he's a badass for doing it. But he wanted to get to know this man. He wanted to know about the man's son. He wanted the man to know about his son.      He's not just trying to be a good judge up there. He's also trying to be a good person. That combo is rare when judges have to get through so many cases in a day and still have loads of paperwork to sort out.
He definitely looks familiar. I think he handled the one where a woman had to bring her kid to court because she had no childcare and he asked the kid some questions and told him to tell his mom the charges were dropped
there should be some system in place for cases like this. Lots of places issue taxi vouchers to seniors to keep them from driving.  r/latestagecapitalism
It makes me feel for his son, too. In addition to chemo, it must be so difficult to watch his 96 year old dad struggle to take care of him, when he, like most children with a good relationship with their parents, probably thought he'd be the one to be there for his elderly dad. I hope they get the assistance they need!
I'm going to out on a limb and say the guy was probably doing slightly less than what the speed limit is adjacent to the school zone, but who knows. I don't think he'd be let off the hook if it was egregious.
Does he at least drink beer?
Especially being that old. Some people are too old to be on the road and speeding isn‚Äôt the only dangerous things
That's why I really struggle to see how this is allowed. Like yeah, the judge is being nice, and that's cool, but if the dude was speeding in a school zone, he was speeding in a school zone. Just because he's old and he has a sad story to tell doesn't make him above the law.
Yeah, I feel like if I was ever given a sentence by him, I wouldn't even be mad, since he took the time to understand what went on.
Maybe ten years ago I was given a ticket I didn‚Äôt earn driving through a tiny town near where I live, so I decided to argue it. It meant missing a couple of hours of work. My colleagues thought I should just pay the ticket and move on. I‚Äôll pay I ticket I earn, but not one I haven‚Äôt. So I sat in on a couple of hours of community court. I don‚Äôt know if this judge was unusual or if small community courts are all like this, but the judge was awesome. People had some of the most incredible hardships - he listened to every one and made decisions tailored to their problems. The experience gave me a new respect and understanding of what local judges do, and I‚Äôm glad I got to witness it.
The judge is where the American system is supposed to benefit from the benevolent philosopher. The laws are the laws, but judges have incredible discretion. Like most of American democracy this has advantages and disadvantages. (See, e.g., convicted rapist Brock Turner; mass incarceration of black males for nonviolent drug charges).  Edit: forgot to use convicted rapist Brock Turner‚Äôs full name
Caught in Providence is the show that features Judge Caprio. The guy really is a good dude and so entertaining to watch.
And I think the same guy that dropped all the parking tickets for a poor woman that was jobless I believe or making very little money and was basically drowning in poverty.

Oh man it‚Äôs the same in my area, public transport isn‚Äôt very good or cheap so people keep driving even when they‚Äôre not really up to it any more, because giving up their car means giving up everything outside of the house. Really needs to be more in place to make sure old people can get out and about without being a danger to anyone.
Probably.  Some of the school zone speed limits are super low.  You can be going 20 in a 15 mph school zone and technically speeding.  You barely touch the pedal to go 20 mph.  I find it hard *not* to speed.  My wife works at the airport, and the speed limit approaching the departures area is 15 mph...it's painfully slow, but I have to do it because I've seen airport cops pulling people over before.
I‚Äôm pretty sure many officers do use that discretion. Maybe this particular officer didn‚Äôt want the responsibility of deciding whether a man in this old age should be driving around. Sometimes recognizing our own limitation to make a judgement call is the best judgement call.
If he sentenced you you know you'd deserve it!
And I think thats all most of us as citizens are asking for. A little understanding of the context and a fair judgement. Shame its so difficult to get for so many. Good on this man for listening and helping when he can in his position.
When I was a college student, I got a moving violation for failing to come to a full and complete stop before making a right turn at a red light.   *On. My. Bicycle.* üôÑ  I couldn't really fight it, because I technically did break the law - but as a broke college student, I couldn't afford to pay the $385 fine, either. (It was the exact same ticket that you'd get for running a red light in a car.)  On a friend's advice, I go to court to beg for leniency. I'm nervous as hell, because I've never been in a courtroom before. The judge was very kind - he heard my plea, and instead of bankrupting a kid for being late for a midterm, he gave me 30 hours of community service.   The best part is, the judge's decision ended up making my life better. I chose to volunteer at a local botanical garden for my service, and that got me interested in conservation, which has led to my lifelong love of volunteering to clean up and fix local hiking trails. All because a judge showed kindness.
He only drives when he has to.
Was she also the woman who lost her son a month previously? Or was that someone else?
Story time for you since I doubt many people will see this. I‚Äôll give you the short version.  My father is a retired NYPD cop. He pulls a guy over one night, license, registration...the whole bit. Notices the guy is acting nervous and decides to ask him a couple questions.  Gets to ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your birthday?‚Äù and the man says ‚ÄúOctober 34th.‚Äù  My father says ‚ÄúOctober 34th, are you sure about that?‚Äù The guy responds with ‚Äú...it‚Äôs either the 34th or the 35th, but to be honest I just smoked a joint and I‚Äôm super nervous right now.‚Äù Definitely one of my fathers favorite stories to tell.
A fair and a good judge. If ever I got myself in trouble I did not even or literally commit I want him to be the judge. Good man, wish there are many more like him.
Right? Like, if you look at the circumstance and decide I deserve it, fine. You're the judge. But at least look at the circumstance.
Yes, she lost her son.
Oh I remember that one. I was balling so bad.
Ball is life üèÄ
It's both. It could have so easily all turned to custard but luckily it ended well.  I'm glad he saved his dog. It's an understandable reaction and all ended well.
"I love how the firefighters just pause for a moment and then just have the looks and gestures of "" dont do it dude... dont go... oh... welp he went...well what the fuck now...‚Ä¶""  Edit : well shit yall, thanks for the gold! First time that's ever happened haha"
Id run into a burning building for an animal, especially a dog. 
[Here is a link with more info](https://www.kusi.com/pala-man-saves-dog-from-burning-house/). Sounds like he and the dog had some burns, but nothing crazy. 
All the people just standing waving their arms around remind me of Sims lol 
First thing I thought was the only reason a person would do that is to save their pet. Glad I wasn't wrong.
I call it awesome :) But Idg why firefighters didn‚Äôt continue hosing? 
From a professional standpoint I can‚Äôt agree with this.   This guy has now not only delayed fire services, but he‚Äôs also placed the safety of the firemen who would have an obligation to place themselves at risk  that didn‚Äôt initially exist in attempt to rescue him.   As a human being that also has a 4 legged companion, I can appreciate the love and loyalty he has for his dog.  
Never leave your best friend to die <3
I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to watch my dog burn, I have no kids and live alone. Would not want or expect anyone else to risk their lives though
Honestly if you put your dog in a kennel you have an obligation to your pet to do this. Dogs have a blind sense of loyalty for you to help them as they would for you as well. 
why did they stop with the water?
Yep, I have four animals. I would be going in. 
Sucks because my brothers close friend died recently running back into her trailer home trying to save her dogs from a fire. I can't imagine the hell her husband is going through.  Edit: basically the man, woman, and dogs were sleeping in the trailer and woke up to part of it being up in flames. They instictly jumped up, and darted outside but the wife noticed she was missing her 3 dogs. She ran in trying to save them, and the husband ran in to try and get her back outside. One dog escaped, and about that time a wall collapsed and fell on the wife. Husband pulled her out from under the wall but she ended up passing away in ICU. The other two dogs died in the fire as well. 
Thank you for this update!!!!
Thank you!!! So happy to see his gofundme doing so well!
"""Oh-daala!!!"""
Guy comes out with pokemon Blue cartridge, and a Magic the gathering deck. 
I figure because the immense pressure the water is under as it escapes the nozzle doesn't feel good  Edit: mismatched tenses
I'm guessing because steam would have cooked the guy faster than the fire?
Never leave a good dog behind 
It‚Äôs the most Wisconsin thing I‚Äôve ever heard.
Yeah, you‚Äôd never be able to live with yourself just watching the fire and knowing your dog was in a kennel.
The water would convert to steam and they could have steam burned him. Basically cooking him and dog. I‚Äôm glad it turned out well.
Dude wouldn't be able to move to get out if they were spraying water at him.
"I have two cats for now and to paraphrase Rosa Diaz ""If anything happened to them I would kill everyone in this room and then kill myself."" Lol!"
Guy comes out with a case of beer.
Also a saying in New Zealand 
Yup. I'd honestly rather die than let my cat get trapped in a burning building. I wouldn't be able to live with myself anyway.
It looked to me like when they started waving firefighters over near the end they were getting prepared to go in after him.  It was stupid on the owners part, but I don't blame him a bit. Pet's are family, it's just unfortunate doing this could put firefighters lives in danger who try to save you.
You just click it to shower mode
they could not spray AT him. Could use a different direction...
NINE-NINE!
Figure it out. 
I would hope that it would be the choice of the fire fighters.   Although it‚Äôs probably the law that requires them to go in after the dude. Which is possibly quite flawed given it could‚Äôve been a suicidal nut job instead of someone trying to save a life while keeping his wits. 
Steam and heat waves would just make it worse for guy inside 
Fremulon
Yeah and considering it's already taking a 30% cut from publishers, it's time someone held it back a little!
Not a doctor. 
Yeah but not going in would mess someone up for a while, people are really good at blaming themselves for things that aren‚Äôt their fault
‚ÄúUnder any circumstances ‚Äú that warms the heart
What company is this? This needs to go viral!
This makes my heart Happy.
So, when my mom was battling cancer, it was just ber, and my siblings and I, me and my brother still in high school. A local landscaping company came to the door to talk to my mom about signing up for their service that season. When she explained she had terminal cancer, and was on a fixed income, she couldn't afford to hire landscapers. I watched the guys arms drop to his sides and he says that he will have a crew out once a week to handle the landscaping, no charge. His mother in law is fighting the same fight and he understands what she was going through. It meant the world to us.
Imagine if we could all be so generous to people in their last stages of life or otherwise deeply afflicted. What a world it would be.
"When people say ""support local business"" it becomes somewhat cliche but I'm here to tell you this same thing happens everyday in small town America.  My grandmother was 95 and her local furnace guy made countless uncharged calls to her home. Came at 2am once.  The septic guy didn't charge a mom who had breast cancer to dig her septic and replace a broken pipe.  The local mechanic/tow guy towed my 76 year old neighbor's car for free when it broke down.  Please, please, please support these small business people!! They often times take care of those who need it the most and many of them just make enough to get by."
My dad runs an appliance repair business and they do not turn a very large profit.  That said, he is always willing to give older folks in hard circumstances a substantial break on price.  It‚Äôs such a small courtesy but it means the world to them and left a lasting impression on me.
My neighbor used to fix boilers and told me this story about the time he got a call on Christmas day. From an old lady who had family in from out of town offer him any amount of money to come and fix her boiler heater which had stopped working suddenly.  He went to her house and she was a tiny 80 year old lady she thanked him for coming. It took him almost an hour to fix it then when he cam back up she was shuffling with her check book he just grabbed her hand and said you have a great Christmas with your family. Then left without accepting a dime
When my elderly father, living in Wales, was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, the local hospital provided a device to help his breathing at home. They asked my mum for the power bill. Huh? Turns out they wanted to coordinate with them to *ensure that no power used by my father with this device would be charged to him*  So not only did they provide the device free of charge, they made sure its usage would also not result in higher bills.  That‚Äôs what you get with a national health service that is focused on care, not costs. For the record, they gave him excellent care to the very end. So that he was comfortable to the end. I will **always** be grateful to the NHS for the compassionate and timely care they gave my dad when he needed it. And mum was not stuck with a bill later.
Well the boiler is fixed, so hers is warmed too.
My friend works at a large vehicle mechanic shop (tractor trailers, farm equipment,  etc...) . An older woman came in and asked how much it would be to repair her RV and if she can pay in cash and coins. Someone put a hole in it backing up a hick mobile boat sized lifted truck with a 2ft long hitch. The guy ran and his plate cover obscured him from cameras.  It left a loaf of bread sized hole in it and broke her sinks plumbing. After finding out not only does she live in it she can't drive it her husband does but he was in the hospital recovering from having a 3ft section of intestine removed due to cancer they went and got it for her on their lunch break. They patched the hole, fixed the sink, and even filled it with dehumidifiers to fight of mold from the sink all for $1 for the appointment and $25 for the work (lowest they can charge) they drove her back to the Costco's parking lot she was parked at. Every year she sends them cookies and fruitcake from wherever they are.
It was by James Anderson. A self employed plumber (small company owner) from Burnley in Lancashire, North England.
Happy cake day!
We can all be this generous to eachother now if we wanted to
For a while longer, at least.
I must be a morbid SOB, because all I can think about is the year the fruitcake doesn't arrive....  Im not crying.
Gratitude is as heart warming as generosity sometimes.
Seems like Mr. Anderson is a regular in the good-deeds department: https://www.burnleyexpress.net/news/plumber-s-generous-gift-will-help-burnley-cafe-owner-lay-on-a-grand-festive-lunch-for-the-homeless-and-families-in-need-1-9402517  What a lad :)
As a lad from Blackburn we‚Äôre not meant to like people from Burnley, but think this guy is the exception!!
That's all any of us have anyway.
>the year the fruitcake doesn‚Äôt arrive  That‚Äôs what my parents call it when I don‚Äôt come home for Christmas.
Some. Walmart's are really cool about it, my local Costco doesn't care so long as it's the back lot. It wasnt permanent.
And he‚Äôs also organizing other plumbers to offer the same type of service that he offers.   What a great guy.
Well that just smacked me in the face.
Smoke him a kipper, he'll be back for breakfast
It just makes what time we have all the more important. That repairman (or his boss) made a positive impact on somebody's life. That's all you can hope for, on any scale.
Haha yep, I took an Americorps service position to try and help afford University.  In part thanks to govt. cuts our government living stipend is currently less then minimum wage, so most of us are living the homeless life.   But, I love the job, working outdoors 8-9 days camping in some of the most beautiful places in the Southwest doing conservation work is the most satisfying thing I've ever done.
I have that. It makes life so incredibly easy and I'm having a hard time seeing how I could cope and be happy otherwise.
I got screamed at because I asked to leave 9.5 hours into a shift because I could only organise 2 weeks in advance a mechanic to fix my car because of a kangaroo I hit on the way to work
Got the exact opposite...  (You better believe I‚Äôm job hunting)
I‚Äôm the same with my team members, 100% flexible about their needs so long as they do the work. In return I‚Äôve found that whenever some extra hours are required they‚Äôll happily stay back or come in early.  If someone said I couldn‚Äôt work from home or come in late/leave early when needed I‚Äôd be petty as hell about doing the slightest bit of work outside my normal hours.
The work at home should be increasingly promoted, as it both often offers better living conditions and working conditions but also because the fact that many people do not have to drive to their work could significantly reduce the CO2 emission.
I'm fortunate enough to work somewhere with this approach. You're allocated work and (sometimes) a deadline - after that it's up to you how you go about it, so long as the work gets done. There's no micro-managing: you're trusted to be able to prioritise your workload and know the best way of undertaking it. If you have a particularly challenging or complex piece of work to do and need to avoid distractions, you work from home. Because of my employer's flexibility, when they require flexibility from me, I'm happy to oblige.  If it was otherwise I know that, personally, my productivity (and job satisfaction) would only be a fraction of what it is.
Not quite agreed. If you are working as part of a team it *is* polite to say if you are going to be late for a doctor's appointment etc. Show consideration for the rest of your team, have the courtesy to keep your boss in the loop, so when *his/her* boss asks where you are, it looks like they know what their team are doing.
As nice as this is, businesses rarely work like this
The workplace has been infantized because of how many people do take the piss, though. It‚Äôs tragic but when you do stumble upon a boss or workplace that develops trust and good work rather than the opposite there is usually a number of people ready to take advantage of that. And, from my experiences, people are so ‚Äònice‚Äô that these spoilsports don‚Äôt get performance managed out.
My SO‚Äôs boss is a dick. I watched my mom literally go mad because of all the harassment at her work place because of her boss, seen my uncle go into depression because of his boss.  Everyone wants to lead and be a boss but no one really understands how much effort goes into being a GOOD boss. Or maybe they just don‚Äôt want to. If your work life is shit, it spills over everywhere else and fucks it up.  Edit: u/yempee can tell you more about his shitty boss experiences because he‚Äôs now interested in reddit.
This is the new American dream:  Being happy.
You've got to get out of that place, that is just shit.
Same though. Apparently the ten hours I work a day isn't good enough. I took a vacation day today. Boss demanded I keep my phone on me to help the new guys. Maybe I don't know, actually trust them to do their jobs? They've been here several months they can handle it at this point.  6 days a week at 10 hours a day and he's constantly telling me I need to do more hours that I'm not catching up with my work. I told him I refuse to work more hours because I need some kind of personal time. He can just push it up the line and either they fire me or, they hire more people. I don't really care at this point.   There's zero support from him what so ever. He's refusing to believe that the project I'm starting Monday will take 8 hours a day of dedicated work from me. He won't give me help. I told him I won't be able to even touch the other 4 smaller projects I have let alone my usual day to day work and he's basically telling me to figure it out. Well, I will. I'll go with the client that pays the most and coincidentally the one I'm trying to get a job with. He can figure the rest out on his own.
Good luck with that!
"Is that something what was laid out from the start? Like did you say to them ""yeah so we believe in flexible working hours etc but don't be surprised if we ask you to stay a few more hours here and there if needed""?"
The idea of spending the overhead electricity, HVAC, and plumbing of an entire office building when people have those facilities at home is absurdly wasteful and counterproductive.  If someone isn‚Äôt doing their job, fire them.  If they are, reward them.  If you can‚Äôt tell the difference from a distance, you‚Äôre a bad boss.
My SO had a boss like that too. One night my SO confessed to me that practically every workday for the past month she had cried on the way home from work. It was heartbreaking. Combined we were making good money. I told her to quit. She did. Our income dropped over $25k. She now has a job she enjoys, for less than half the money, but just seeing the change in her happiness day after day has been well worth the loss in income.  Conversely I have a boss like OP's image describes. I work in a law firm wearing shorts and t-shirt 5 days a week. I'm 20% more efficient as a result, and twice as dedicated because my boss gives me the freedom and comfort to be my best.  I could earn more elsewhere easily, but it would be almost impossible to be as comfortable doing so.  If bosses realized how much better production would be, and how much staff retention would improve if they just treated staff like OP's image, every boss would do the same.   Good luck to your SO. Maybe time for her to see what else is out there for her.
His job or Australia?
"When I started as a lead, I made it clear upfront that as long as the customers are happy then I'm happy. I started ""flex time"" at the job and naturally, people loved it. I wasn't able to allow them to work from home just because of the job but if we could have, you better believe that that would have been a thing too. I sure as shit don't want to be at work at 0700 every single day for an eternity so I'm not going to make my employees be.  It worked out really well for us because we had a few early birds who wanted to be there at 0700 so they'd leave a little earlier each day. And then we had a few people like me that like rolling into work at some point between 0700-0800 and will stay until 1600-1700. Quite a few of them had an insane amount of medical appointments but what am I really going to do? Tell them that they can't go? Lol! Ok... So if they took two hours for an appointment, they just worked an extra two hours at some point in the pay period and our pay periods were by the month so working 15-30 minutes extra each day to catch up is super easy to do. And yes, sometimes we needed to work late but typically, everyone was fine with that because then it just meant that they were leaving earlier on a Friday or coming in later on a Monday."
"My last job made us work 9-6. I worked from home, but my kids had to be in daycare. My daycare is open only til 6, and my husband couldnt get them after work. They were inflexible about changing my shift, so I used to have to break the rules, go get them at lunch and try to keep them entertained all afternoon. My husband had to quit his job to find one that fit the daycare schedule. I got another job later, and my boss was like, ""I dont have an issue with you working 8-5, just get your work done. I want you to not worry about your kids."" Problem solved, loyalty earned."
Yes.
"I'm either about to get fired or forced to quit. I'm I'm pregant and have the ability to work from home while my 12 y/o is on summer break. However I was told I need to put my infant in daycare or the will need to reevaluate my position - I was also told that my dept needs to be in the office when clearly that's not true as I am the only one ""forced"" to be in the office. I said look man, yall don't pay me enough to pay for daycare. Yall want me to work for essentially 4 bucks an hour (if daycare is 10+/hr) and its not happening boo. So while I am thrilled to have this baby, I'm also in fear of not having my job. Lol. Ain't that some shit? They already fired a chick at 6 mos so I'm just doing my time and preparing for my due date. Honestly, fuck corporate."
NAL, but I'd say don't quit, make them fire you, and then sue their asses for discrimination.
As a boss, this is an HR violation, by telling you that you are required to be in the office. I have individuals who work from home, on a regular bases, and some who even went as far as making them selves permanent teleworkers. As long as the shit gets done, and they are not on any written warnings, who cares.  But when there is clearly no reason for the policy change, or others are still able to telework, then it becomes a legal issue, then let them fire you and get the unemployment benefits.
Line up the lawyer and get extensive consultation before executing that plan.
Epic Meal Time with a purpose!
i‚Äôve seen videos about him before, the dude is a legend
When I used to have difficulties with eating food I would watch his videos to help distract me and try to stimulate my appetite while I ate. His videos helped me through some rough times. 
God announces Bob Ross 2 Cooking Boogaloo
Heard of my man before, but can someone post some deets?  Edit: Love seeing this type of stuff come of India!! <3
He‚Äôs a beast - cooks everything over wood fire.  Videography nicely done too
Now I have to find him on YouTube because more subscribers for him = more money for him. 
It's that a giant pizza? It looks delicious 
And food that actually looks good to eat.
I love the way he says ‚Äúoil‚Äù
[here's the channel link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1of9ELYwB623fWaAMRDVFA)  edit: thank u bros for the expressions of gratitude 
I like you. I can relate your story to mine with Bob Ross and self esteem. I hope you're happy and healthy :) 
He's Indian, and every meal he makes is prepared in giant, I mean GIANT proportions, which is then shared with orphaned kids. He also uses his Patreon to spread awareness for charities, natural disaster relief funds, and orphanages. His YouTube channel is called Grandpa Kitchen. He's the sweetest fucking old man.
Actually subscribing doesn't give him any more money. The only thing subscribers is good for is getting bigger brands to sponsor him.   If you really want to help him just play his videos in the background, then he gets ad revenue
What are you talking about?? You mean people don‚Äôt wanna eat 60 Big Macs wrapped in greasy bacon which is then dunked in batter and deep fried to hell and consequently dipped in cheese sauce?
ah-yil
"Don't forget ""ghee!"" and ""mixwell"""
Just to be clear, hes not the one running any of the online stuff, that's his grandsons 
Their over unders on monthly are hilarious. Maybe he's pulling $7,000 a month. Or maybe he's pulling nearly 20 times than. Who knows hahaha
Your sarcasm offends me
*Basmati rice intensifies*
Your taking offense offends me.
This is outrageous, I'm outraged.
that dude just straight jumped into the window of a moving car to save a complete stranger, a wholesome madlad
The guy's FB post about it:  >Wow I just saved this guy's life in the blue car i jumped in his car he was having a seizure at the wheel the cops said they saw me jump in his window like dukes of Hazzard it was crazy I saw him coming at me so I backed up real fast to the side and jumped out and jumped in his car to stop it wow my adrenaline is still going
Car unjacking.
Chaotic good
We need more people like the guy In the truck. 
Is there a full video?
To the guy that jumped into the car:  You did good. You pass.
I read it as ‚Äúguy stops his truck and drives into another car to help the driver‚Äù and I was thoroughly confused. 
Well that driver may not get their driving privileges back for a LOOOOONG time.   If you‚Äôre asking why, if you have a seizure while NOT driving a doctor could be obligated to report you to the DMV. If it does get reported you need to be cleared by a neurologist. Now if you have a seizure while driving? A doctor would be held EXTREMELY liable if they didn‚Äôt report you to the DMV.   Edit: update - depends on state. Some states require the driver to report, some require doctor.
A friend of the family has epilepsy and she was swimming in her pool with my daughter and her daughter, both 5 years old. Luckily I happened to be standing near the side of the pool as my friend floated by face down, convulsing. At first it didnt register what was happening, as I thought she was just playing a game with the girls. I pulled her out of the pool in the middle of her seizure and noticed her face and hands were blue. I had to perform CPR on her for a few minutes until she coughed up water. She is fine now but man epilepsy is scary. Glad to see this guy had the gumption to jump in and help. 
This is awesome! These types of videos remind me of those shows on TV with the hidden camera where someone is being bullied or whatever and everyone else gets a chance to intervene.   I've intervened on occasions. Other times I haven't. When it's just me alone with no kids or family, I'm more apt to help because I wouldn't want to risk their safety and well being to act fast. But maybe that's an excuse...
I had my first seizure while pulling my car out of my parents cul de sac and had a neighbor do something similar. I bought him a bottle of glenlivet 18 and a 30 pack of beer as a thank you. I didn‚Äôt drive for years afterward out of fear. 
In Switzerland there's an award for people like this. Translated we call them 'knights of the street'. Always liked that, people like him deserve it.
Adrenaline is a hell of a drug
Adrenaline is a 73-word, breathless run-on sentence.  I don‚Äôt blame him. I‚Äôd be buzzing too.  [EDIT] Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!
"""Alright, Steve, cut the crap. We all know your life isn't that crazy."""
Ballsy, to see police in pursuit of a rolling vehicle then decide to reverse your truck, block traffic/point it at them, and then run out and jump into what would look like a suspect in pursuits car. Not quite like tripping a purse snatcher.   And I don‚Äôt think he already knew from the radio or a scanner that the guy was seizing since he stopped to assess the situation for a second before jumping in. 
Guarantee if this guy hadve posted this comment on reddit without the video evidence he would have been cross posted to the 'thathappened' subreddit in a heartbeat!
Wholesome GTA
This guy and the monkey in the Lion King are the only characters I think that qualify.
The world is full of people like him
[Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvVl7iIR85U)
from the above youtube link, it looks like the dude that intervened had a clearer view of the driver, as well as more time to assess the situation, and acted on what he could see, and what he could do. - I'm no fan of police that don't do their job, but these guys are blameless, as they weren't there in time to do anything you suggest.
Any chance of an international look?
You‚Äôd only get the adrenaline if you felt the call to action already
Did...did you count every word lol?

If you watch how that guy walks back to his truck... he is *amped* on adrenaline. Like vibrate-through-a-wall levels of amped.
What do you mean by international look? Kinda lost here...  Edit: thanks guys. Sure would like to. But actually, this made me look up the award online and it says the last award was given out in 2016 because 'interest faded' and they stopped doing it. What a disgrace. [Here's](http://www.ritterderstrasse.ch) the link to the Swiss website. Let's make them go global...
He definitely did. The next comment down had this quote from the guy's Facebook:  >Wow I just saved this guy's life in the blue car i jumped in his car he was having a seizure at the wheel the cops said they saw me jump in his window like dukes of Hazzard it was crazy I saw him coming at me so I backed up real fast to the side and jumped out and jumped in his car to stop it wow my adrenaline is still going
I saved a little girl (3yo) from drowning at a pool party. Jumped right in without thinking about it.  I'm fucking **terrified** of the water!!!

Grand Thought Altruism
I agree. Most people want to do the right thing
Then he drives off into the sunset.
"> vibrate-through-a-wall levels of amped  Hell yeah he is.  I once stopped to help a woman who was running down a rural-ish highway waving at cars.  It was at like 3:30 AM on New Year's Day in dense fog.  Totally surreal.  She just opened my car door and got in, screaming her head off hysterically.  Then her boyfriend showed up and started yelling.  While I was on the cellphone with the cops.  Yada-yada-yada ... cops show up and arrest the guy and haul him off.  Turned out they had had an argument while driving,  and he had dragged her into the bushes and tried to choke her.  I was hella wired.  One of the cops just chilled with me on the side of the road shooting the shit for like 45 minutes until I felt ready to drive home.  Anyway,  ""vibrate through walls"" always makes me think of [Radical Larry](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/qc39b/radical_larrythis_guy_is_all_business_all_the/). "
I suppose he meant extending the award to people from other countries, or something similar

Supreddit?  Nm u?
Did this for my little brother, a friend of his always did too, got him through some tough times and helped build confidence in his life overall. Support your friends, folks. Ten minutes of your time makes a difference.  Edit; Edited to add- thanks for all the awards guys! I‚Äôm glad my first were in honor of my little bro and helping people, that‚Äôs always been more of his thing than mine being the sassy older sister.  Love you Sharkbearagator8, guess we‚Äôll find out if you have a reddit account!
I‚Äôve seen this several times and I wish we could find a way to get a lot of viewers to Go look at this kids streams. Everyone needs a little boost every once and a while
>dirty little secrets  >I support my friend to keep his spirit up  /r/confessions in one image.
This happened the 2nd day I was streaming. Had a super interactive, intelligent conversation with someone. I was super stoked! Turned out to be my brother (he wasn‚Äôt trying to hide it - I just never knew his online alias).  It was the best stream I ever did.
I agree I do the same with my friend. I no longer live close but he streams every once in a while so I show up and we talk about life and such. Im his only viewer and im even a mod :)
It really does.  My SO has an anonymous blog which she uses as a cathartic means to release what she's not able to share with others... she told me about it.. and apparently no else knows much about it... nothing controversial.. just her thoughts and struggle with anxiety etc.  I've got 4 different accounts I use to keep her going.. plus increase the viewer stats and comments.. not in a sycophantic manner. Just calm stuff edging her on. Not to give up etc. No advise at all just encouragement.  Everytime she finally posts something and gets a response. She normally runs to me and shows me the comments in excitement, telling me she feels heard. And I live for that smile... and gladly nowadays, I don't even have to do much as other people have joined and they keep lifting her up.
We should do this. Find a way to get a few viewers to watch some small streams every once in a while. I‚Äôd be completely on board.  Edit: A lot of people were suggesting subreddits so I made r/StreamWatchParty.
This makes me so happy! Good for you. I recently moved across the country so I love being able to support him in another way far away. Keep it up- it makes a difference in his life!
hit me up it it ever happens, I knit and watch streams and have lots of time for small streams.
Me too, I watch streams while I draw. I would love to do something like this.
Nah, just disabled and depressed. Knitting stuff for the hospital or DV shelter makes me feel useful and I like watching people play games I don't have the hand eye coordination to play. lol  But I do live in a house, so you're half right. xD
It's all fun and games until someone jumps off while the other one is in the air
I‚Äôm confused on how they got permission from both governments to install on both sides of the wall.
That's the fucking saddest thing I've seen in my life

That is the ultimate betrayal! I lost friends over this.
The wall is on the US side. The actual border is beyond the wall so they didn‚Äôt need permission from both governments since the wall is in the United States
Right? That's the first thing that popped in my head. Usually I try to be optimistic but this is just sad.
r/aboringdystopia
Then you really haven't seen much in your life
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the side with more kids.
Having been to mexico many a time... it‚Äôs 100% the side with the random dog who just kinda hangs out
Isnt that border filled with mines and razor wire? Pretty dangerous place for a seesaw.
Oh shit, thats golden

"This shit makes me want to cry. Everything about her body language at the begining said ""Please don't hurt me""."
Being alone for so long it makes sense that the dog would rather have support and just a friend more than food :'(
"I love when he takes the last piece of meat offered and is all ""and now I must take this gift away, as is dog custom."""
It's sweet that he wants the cuddles more than the meat
This makes me wanna find a stray dog
What a sweet baby angel. I wish She had a home. SHe just wanted that lovin so much.
He wanted the pats more than food... he‚Äôs the bestest boi/girl
I'm gonna give my dog a long hug after work.
Edit: Original video by [Amir Hosein](https://www.instagram.com/amirhosein_hami_heyvanat/) who lives in Iran.   ~~I believe this is Animal Aid Unlimited India on YT.~~
That submissive behaviour might seem cute but to me it just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had the shit kicked out of me more than a few times.‚Äù

Proof that dogs can feel shame gratitude and love
My heart. This hits close to home because my dog was found left for dead on the streets after a family abused her and my family rescued her and now she is the most spoiled little girl I know. She still gets scared by big men but she likes small people.
Yah that initial reaction was heart breaking. And then she wanted affection more than the food... who's cutting onions at my office?
"I have a neice who is physically and mentally handicaped and she spends a lot of time in hospital and has had a lot of painful operations.  She is not well mentally developed but she is very sweet and can't really communicate past a few words but when is in hospital she constantly says ""sorry"" to the doctors and nurses because she thinks they are coming to hurt her and she doesn't understand why.......there have been many tears from many people."
Its like with those videos where dog rescuers takes stray dogs to the vet and you see them get healthy and get adopted. The transformation from fear, anger and overall feral behaviour to happy good boys and girls always bring tears to my eyes.
Same could be said for many homeless persons :'(
Yes, so she doesn‚Äôt get attacked and have it stolen
"Our dog does this because she was the runt of the litter.  Any time she gets food that's big enough to carry (bones/meat) she'll take it back to either her kennel or another area with corners (she loves those because of safety).  We got her from a closed down puppy farm that had just been busted and she still has issues at 6. Only ever barks when someone that's not family walks over the threshold of our house.  Never any time else. She communicates with other kinda funny noises between high pitched ""arroooo's"" in the morning and other non-normal noises.  Point is, this dog is definitely protecting its food. But it doesn't have to be a stray to develop that mentality, siblings can do the same thing."
I ‚Äúsaved‚Äù my cat (found him outside and thought he was cute) from the streets and he does the exact same thing! If I give him a little bit of food he runs away with it before eating like I‚Äôm gonna take it back. I‚Äôve had him now longer than he was ever a stray but that instinct is engrained.
Maybe that‚Äôs what he needs more atm.
She doesn't want cuddles, she's being submissive. It's very likely this dog suffered abuse and acts like this to avoid it happening again.
I once found a cat in the parking lot of my old apartment complex.  Skin and bones.  She was three years old and weighed under 4.5 lbs (should be 9.5-10lb).  I brought some food out to her (my roommate had a cat) and she took a bite but then immediately started rubbing on my legs and purring.  Every few minutes she would go to take another bite and immediately come back for scratches and attention.  Anyway, that's the story of how I got my cat 8 years ago.
Doggo is a she, and looks like she has had puppies at some point too. You can see her enlarged nipples.
I just checked out their couple of videos.. I'm simultaneously devastated and happy for all those rescued animals.  Edit: For anyone reading, most of those videos are highly NSFW (blood and gore). Just a word of caution.
Legit my first thought. The fact that the affection meant more to him than likely the best meal he's ever had is fuckin heartbreaking.
That little happy tail wag when he pulled out the food.
Jesus christ man... That's heartbreaking.
I think there is no such thing as bad dogs.  Only bad owners.  Some are just more challenging than others.
Same could be said for my non-homeless ass :'(
My adopted dog does the same thing. She never eats straight from the bowl. She picks a few pieces and then eat them somewhere near by.
can relate.
Yeah that is definitely fear. She is too afraid to eat first. Likely abused as you said.
There are whole charities in the south (where the kill rate is high) set up to bring dogs north where they can be adopted out easily.
Wow your eyes just go right for the nipples don't they. *Animal.*
I knew it was you! I had my suspicions, it was between you and Brian in sales.
Have a Pyrenees who refused to listen. My dad started eating his dinner out of the dog‚Äôs bowl before washing it and putting dog food in there.  He **did not** like that, like at all, but eventually started listening to us. Another thing we did was making him sit and wait until all of us walked through any door before letting him go. In the beginning he would struggle his hardest to run through the door first but now he sits and waits to come in last.
I saw it as being too scared to eat and thus being submissive to stay alive, rather than more happy to get affection than food
I'm with you bro. You got this.
My dog does this to, I assumed it was normal dog behavior....
You think I couldn't get a Brian? I could *get* a Brian
I got that feeling as well. Especially since he was clearly going somewhere else to eat at the end, low low trust even after being petted and fed. Seen some shit.
Can i join the hug?
It is sometimes. A lot of it is instinct, even for dogs that've never really had to competed for food (some do it, some don't). But it's extra common among strays and shelter dogs that get adopted, because of _why_ it's an instinct (food competition) that they've had experience with. Like a lot of things it can be ingrained from nature, nurture, or both.
American hero
That's a true man of substance. This is the kind of person that we need to be helping with education and support. This level of moral character and self-sacrifice needs to be encouraged and rewarded.
Poor kid now has to live with a colostomy bag... absolute hero. Wish i could meet him someday
Let‚Äôs not forget the mental scars he and so many others will have from this shooting. 
I have no idea who the shooter was. But I know who Anthony Borges is. Lets keep it that way. 
People think they know what they would have done to be brave in situations like that, but when it‚Äôs actually happening in front you, people freeze up.   One time I returned to work a couple hours after my shift because I had forgotten something. As I pull into the parking spot right in front of the store, someone walked right by the front of my car and into the store, jumped the counter, and threatened the only person there at the time with a knife. I froze up for what felt like forever, then I started my car, drove a block away, and called 911.   I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I relived that situation in my head. What I could have done differently. I could have driven my car up against the front door so the guy couldn‚Äôt escape. I could have went in behind him and at least then it would be 2v1 and the cook who was there alone had a broom in his hand at the time. But nope. I just froze up and then drove away to call the police. 
Source: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/school-shooting-survivors.html   You've got to read this. Very hard, but must be read. 
Anthony borges looks like he‚Äôs about to drop the hottest album of the year.   For real though, this is the definition of a hero. 
This is in the wrong sub! He isn‚Äôt a bro he is one of the bravest, selfless, human beings I‚Äôve ever seen!
Im from Australia. I grew up loving everything about America and wanting nothing more then to move and live there. But I couldn't imagine living in a country where this kind of thing is not only a possibility but generally accepted. 
Can we make this a monthly repost? One of the few I would gladly upvote every time. 
Atlas couldn‚Äôt lift this dudes balls. 
OP This Man is  True Hero! Do you know anything about him? A Go Fund Me account to pay for college?
Dude is a fuckin hero. The most bro a human could possibly bro.
This is the type of things I wish I‚Äôd see more often on the news 
"~~American~~ Hero.  This kid should have a card that says ""I got shot 5 goddamn times saving peoples lives"" that gets him free plane tickets, meals, accommodation and limo rides.  Balls of adamantium and mithril."
Exactly. This young man has more balls and courage than most of us would dream of having. Respect to him
He shouldn't have to work a day in his life that he doesn't want to, and should be able to pursue his dreams without any kind of monetary or resource restrictions.   Has anyone set something up to raise funds beyond medical expenses?  The government should have an automatic cash rewards system for people like this. Not that I know how it would be administered. But conceptually, it makes sense to me. 
I hope that it‚Äôs only temporary. My husband had a temporary bag for about 4 months after major abdominal surgery. 
They're not bad, you get used to it after a while. Living with one is better than the alternative most times. 
This is the article that photo comes from. It talks to survivors of shootings, and what their livea are like  http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/school-shooting-survivors.html
His eyes say it all. The scars we can see are just the tip of the iceberg. 
I agree, we should share the names of heroes, and give no attention to the cowards who make them into heroes
He specifically mentions not wanting to be called a hero in the article.
You called the police. You may not realize this, but there are plenty of people that won't do that, for lots of reasons.  You're not a trained professional. If you went in you could have made things worse. If you blocked the door you could have made him angry, trapped him. You left it to the professionals. You did good. 
"Betina Lynn, oh my god. ""The moment the second bullet hit me, I tried to crawl underneath the table, but there was a bar, so I couldn‚Äôt. So I made the decision that instead I was going to purposefully watch what transpired. Because they were going to need witnesses."""
God damn, that list just goes on and on and it's just the tip of the iceberg 
I know they even have fake plastic surgeries to add extra skin on their skin to look like scars! They are so committed, maybe they even shot themselves five times!
/r/HumansBeingTheBestHumans
> where this kind of thing is not only a possibility but generally accepted.  Stop being silly - it's not generally accepted any more than you think France is totally A-OK with people driving trucks through crowds.  Seriously, don't be that guy/gal.
It‚Äôs a colostomy, it‚Äôs used to gather his feces and waste because his lower abdomen was so messed up :(
I kind of wish we didn‚Äôt have to... but agree with point under circumstance 
Can't even fathom how I'd react in the situation but it's always good to see someone act so selfless in a time of panic.
How can we help him with his healing process? I'm sure he has a number of bills. 
I mean I think that would almost encourage risking your life like a vigilante. This guy is hero no doubt, but it shouldn‚Äôt be encouraged to seek things out like that.
It exists. Carnegie Hero Fund: https://www.carnegiehero.org
Agreed. I cant imagine the discomfort and awkward feeling wearing a bag must create. Ive known people who wore these types of things and they seem to manage well.
Wow. His story is so raw. I hope he gets the help he needs.   > I can‚Äôt run, and I want to run. I‚Äôm doing homeschooling now. I‚Äôm not sure when I‚Äôll go back to school. I don‚Äôt want to; I don‚Äôt feel safe. I don‚Äôt talk about it with anybody ‚Äî I get really upset. I can‚Äôt talk about it with my friends. I did what I had to do ‚Äî that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like being called a hero.
Exactly.  If someone shoots up a school that person should get absolutely zero coverage.  No Bullshit fame for someone that kills
This should be for every shooting or tragedy. I don't know if it's improving recently, maybe I'm optimistic, but I can't honestly tell you the names of either the MAGAbomber or the Synagogue shooter.   Keep it that way. This guy deserves his name in the papers, they do not. 
Yeah but that‚Äôs just humility 
I‚Äôve tried to convince myself I did the best thing. The guy could have easily just grabbed a stool and broke the glass. He could have taken the lone employee hostage or just attacked him. 
We're the only one. The world looks at us in horror. 
Absolutely. But rather hear about a hero like this than the entire background information of the shooter. Perhaps if we focused on good deeds, we‚Äôd have happier people!
If it makes your feel any better although we hear about every shooting on the news and it's tragic, overall violent crime is the lowest it's ever been. 
Why shouldn‚Äôt he get some sort of government hero‚Äôs award. He is no vigilante he was not the instigator here. He saw a chance to save his friends lives at the likely expense of his.  This guy should get a parade and a scholarship. His selfless act of sacrifice should be  rewarded and recognized at the highest levels of honor society can provide as an example of what is best in human nature.   What would you have done? Saw a chance and yielded to cowardice? Let all your friends die and you likely got shot anyway. 
The State Department has reward programs for helping take down terrorists, drug lords, animal traffickers, murderers, fraudsters, and more... so that's not really a valid excuse if the US government encourages similar stuff already. See the [Rewards for Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewards_for_Justice_Program) program, and also the [Narcotics Rewards Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotics_Rewards_Program). If we're paying out millions to people who often have to go into hiding for the rest of their lives, this isn't that much of a stretch by comparison.
They're not bad. You get used to it. It's better than the alternative. I got a permanent bag when I was 20.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone can read this and be against common sense gun control at the very least.
It's interesting to look at the picture which is clearly meant to show how courageous, tough, and brave he was that day. But in the interview it's so clear that he is still just a child who went through something terrible.
I know Reddit hates religion, but I think it would be disrespectful to his wishes to exclude the line immediately following.  >...¬†I don‚Äôt like being called a hero. I want people to remember what happened as a miracle, from God.
Or survivor's guilt.
No it's not just humility. People who act heroically don't always make that choice. They just act. They don't specifically decide to do whatever it is they did. Like Anthony said, he did what he *had* to do, not what he thought was best.   I'm not an expert on this at all, but there's a pretty good radiolab episode you might want to give a listen to. How To Be A Hero.  I'm not saying that Anthony isn't a hero. Objectively, he absolutely is. Even if people who act heroically don't necessarily make the choice to act heroically, doesn't down play what they did. For some bizarre reason, I feel like because there wasn't even a choice to be made, it was just the only option for them, it makes them better? Some next level human shit. Who knows, maybe Anthony did make a choice.  Ultimately, what I'm getting at is respect what Anthony was saying. If he doesn't want to be called a hero, don't just brush that off. It could be (and probably is) coming from a deeply complicated and emotional place. Like another commenter said, possibly survivors guilt.  I don't know why your comment struck such a nerve with me, but it did. And I'll be honest, I didn't put a ton of thought into my reply. I just wrote what I was feeling.
Man, you are so right. We immortalize the monster rather than the hero, likely inspiring other monsters
That‚Äôs nice but kids should never get shot at school period, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs something we should ever accept happening regardless of crime statistics.
Is it exposed organs/flesh under there? Is it super fragile? Like if you were to catch a fight would a gutter do you in? Thats a wierd question ik. But i recently moved and a guy was wearing a bag and i was really suprised how much weight he pulled.
"The problem is that a big chunk of the US think ""common sense gun control"" means putting a glock in the hands of every idiot in the country"
"To quote my hero academia ""the greatest heroes all reportedly experienced the same thing. No matter the circumstance, and no matter the risk, their bodies just moved before they could think."" Thats what it means to be a hero. Where it's built into the very fibre of your being. Where the notion of selflessness is so second nature to you, that even in a split second of crisis, you're moving to help your fellow man."
So I had a bag for a while and you have a piece of intestine (called a stoma) sticking out about an inch. It moves around on its own sometimes and poops/farts into the bag (made dinner very fun because you can‚Äôt control it). It‚Äôs really not that fragile, no pain nerves or anything so you can touch it and you won‚Äôt feel it.   You change the bag every couple of days to clean the stoma and the skin. It‚Äôs mentally taxing but for me, my colon was so fucked so I felt 1000000x better afterwards. 
It's called a stoma. You can Google it... It's a bit unsettling to see at first but you get used to it. Basically some of your interesting comes out of your stomach.   If someone punched you in that spot it wouldn't kill you but it would push it in to you and hurt so fucking bad. Also if got pushed in to far it would leak poop inside of you which could kill you slowly and painfully. Overall you can live a pretty normal life just gotta check for leaks and if your bag is filled with too much gas. 
An old lady named Doreen worked herself into a frenzy over gun control yesterday.  Just because I raised my eyebrows at her unsolicited, pro-gun statements while we both happened to be taking a smoke break.  There were other people there too, who agreed with *her*, but she still got really upset at me.  I literally did not say a word to her.  These are not reasonable people.  Frankly it's more than a little disturbing that they are the most likely to have guns.
Or taking guns away completely.   Republicans: 'Them libs taking our guns away!!' Common sense person: 'No we just want better control so school shootings aren't happening every week.'
Wow. Upkeep sounds aggravating. Does it attatch/detatch easily?  Im suprised you cant feel the intestine seeing how brutal food poisoning feels on the whole digestive system.
I don't know what I'd do if some of my interesting came out of my stomach.
I called my first one Stoma Steve. Now I have an ileostomy, his name is Billy Ostomy.
Republicans: The government has no power to tell us how to live our lives and dictate what we do!    Also republicans: We support the government in making abortions illegal and making it harder to access birth control.
Your body has different types of sensory nerves -- you just don't notice because the parts you're aware of have all of them.  Your intestines can feel pain from being stretched too much (like from being too full with gas), and from muscle cramps (same as your skeletal muscles when you work out too hard). They don't have any nerves that can sense touch, firm pressure, or warmth.
That is pretty weird to think about, maybe there are pain receptors on the inside and that‚Äôs why we feel pain with food poisoning? I have no clue honestly  The bag is specialized for this type of thing so they shouldn‚Äôt come off easily (you need certain wipes to remove the adhesive). People play sports in them and go swimming. They may leak if it‚Äôs put on poorly or you have really really liquidy poops, so people will eat certain foods to thicken it up. Helps with emptying too which is done through the bottom of the bag into a toilet (kinda like a heavy duty ziploc bag).   Edit: for irony by the way, I went to MSD and graduated in 2010 lol 
Don‚Äôt worry about being personal! I actually did an AMA a few years ago about it, I think it‚Äôs important for people to ask questions and to learn more!  The answer depends on what is happening inside at that moment. For example, my first surgery removed my colon and my small intestine was stuck out of my body, meaning that it didn‚Äôt connect to anything internally. Therefore, my rectum is just hanging out and getting a break from it‚Äôs job of storing waste. However, it still produces some mucus that you might need to let out in the toilet. So no poop/gas because nothing is connected to it at that time, just mucus.  After my second surgery, my rectum was removed and my small intestine was brought back into my body and made into a J-shape which ultimately replaced my rectum. While that healed up, my small intestine formed a loop on the outside of my body where the initial stoma was, kind of like a kink in a hose, and that went into a bag. Sometimes though, because it‚Äôs a loop, some poop may continue traveling and than you let that out the normal way. It‚Äôs really fascinating how our body handle this stuff.  Now, after that ‚ÄùJ-pouch‚Äù healed, they close the loop and stick the small intestine back inside...then normal bathroom habits again! Wooooo 
This stuff is so damn weird. Like, a reminder that we‚Äôre all just organic robots with literal plumbing inside us to get things that our body needs for whatever reason.
These boys will be very surprised when get older and go to a Gentlemen's Club. At least they'll be well-dressed for the occasion.

This is awesome, I've seen that people will live up or down to the expectations they have put on them. If you give them something to be positive about all the better, this is great.   We need more positive role models in our lives and less stupid drama and bullshit.
That one white kid lol
Wish we had teachers like this where I live.! Y dad beat me till he was arrested and removed from my house when I was 12.  Im 22 and still can't talk to men or look them in the eye as strange as it sounds. 
He definitely taught these kids more than just how to be gentlemen.
Teachers like this are awesome!!
This is the type of male leadership we NEED.  
Awesome. I'm glad these kids have a male role model. That can make all the difference.

"My Ex and I took in one of our friends who had broken up with her SO, and had no place to go. She decided to try 'dancing' and we took her to her audition.   I was going to wait in the car, but my Ex told me not to be silly and come inside to wait. I had a paperback novel with me, so I sat there and read it at the bar, thinking I would be left alone.  That's when about 6 half dressed ladies came up to me and started ripping on me, in a good-natured, pleasant way. ""I don't think I've ever seen anyone read a book in here before!"" etc.  They nicknamed me ""Book"" and whenever I'd come to pick the roommate up from work, they'd be like ""Hi Book!""  I ended up being pretty comfortable around them and it pretty much changed my mind about strip clubs. I still think it's weird, but I am glad the women have a safe(er) alternative to prostitution and more power to them if they can earn a decent living flashing some skin.  I also didn't realize how much athleticism and skill some of them have while dancing (this was a while ago before the pole dancing workouts and when people still read physical books). "
I wish people would stop trying to catch eachother out
As someone like your cousin how did this end for him?
The initial awkwardness aside, strippers make for great conversations with socially awkward dudes because they don‚Äôt judge. Ever. They can‚Äôt, and not in a turn your nose up, ‚ÄúYou take off your clothes and grind on people for money, you can‚Äôt judge me‚Äù way, it‚Äôs basically their job to not judge you.    From a business perspective, they get the best returns not by coming up to 10 different guys for 10 different private dances/whatever that‚Äôs a lot of work for maybe 10 different reasons they can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt buy a dance or buy them a drink. Its best to keep one guy hooked for the long haul, so it‚Äôs in their vested interest to stick with one person and be interested in you (or feign interest in you). They will find something, anything to find common ground between dances or sitting with your friends to keep you engaged.    You hold the money, you have the keys to the kingdom. Remember that at the end if the day, that $20-40 bumpy grindy dry hump set to ZZ Top‚Äôs ‚ÄúLagrange‚Äù is a business transaction she has to sell you on, it she goes about her business to someone else. Want to talk about the last episode of Game of Thrones? Sure. Your fantasy football team? Hey, she also drafted that dude in her team, he sucked last week! Your anime fan-faction? No... no probably not. I mean... maybe...? Naw. But most everything else is fair game if you have the money and you follow the rules.   Is your life boring? Make something up! What‚Äôs she gonna do, call you out on it? I have friends who used to go to on a regular basis to a strip Club and would take me with them maybe one a month and I made it a point to really sell one lie each night to make things interesting. Fake job, just came back from a fake vacation, fake interesting celebrity I kinda sorta know because my college roommate works for their publicist and I‚Äôve met them 3 times. Get crazy, she‚Äôll dump you out if her mind at the end of the night and at worst you look stupid in front of someone you‚Äôll probably never see again. At least not without a black light on and Motely Crue blaring out of the speakers.
I want to be like this guy when I grow up.
Strippers are people too. I've been friends with a few; depending on where they work, there's a good chance they put up with a lot of bullshit. A kinda awkward but polite guy who got dragged in by his friends is not a bad day at work. 
but im a toys r us kid
I‚Äôm impressed with her quick thinking. Glad she was there. 
What are proper signs of someone about to have a seizure? I'd honestly like to know.
Amazing perception and reflexes.  She also looks impressively strong for being able to brace her up at that angle.  Any longer footage?
And she tried to let her down smoothly.  Awesome bro-ness!
Imagine what was going through her head, jesus
Dude just randomly rounding the corner. Video cuts off right after. But you can tell they drop everything and run to help   Edit:After watching the full clip, I'll recant my statement. He was clueless.  Hats off to that cashier for her poise through it all!
Good karma, please follow this lady.
My sister has epilepsy, so does her husband. Once I was visiting and she had a seizure while holding her baby. I grabbed my niece similar to the video, but thankfully my sister was sitting when it happened so she just slid down onto the floor. It‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôve seen her and her husband have a handful of episodes, and I used to worry for my niece when she was little, but she survived. She‚Äôs 9 now.  You may not realize how common of a disorder it is.
This is very out of place, but I have to laugh at how the baby just accepts being taken by another person.   ‚ÄûI guess ur my new momma now‚Äú
What an awesome cashier! I don‚Äôt think many people would grab someone‚Äôs baby from over a counter. 
Thats what quality customer service looks like
That impresses me too all the time. I always think I‚Äòd stand there not understanding the situation until something happens.
Love that guy coming around the corner when the cashier asks for help...  ‚ÄòDude, I just came here for some chips...‚Äô
It's really hard to say as it varies but if you notice someone just sort of start going fuzzy in terms of cognition, they start getting confused when moments ago they weren't, muscle rigidity or severe muscle relaxation, blank stare. It's hard to determine exactly whether what you're witnessing is a seizure or some other neurological condition but it's a good idea to general check in on someone that starts exhibiting these behaviors. Some people with seizure disorders have visual cues such as necklaces or bracelets that they experience a condition which can help narrow down what's going on. My cousin used to have a pretty good ability of alerting people before she went down so it can sometimes be expressed by the individual prior to an episode. If people exhibit these behaviors just take it as seriously as you can and if you're unsure of why someone just blacked the fuck out in front of you- recovery position for the victim and either yourself or SPECIFICALLY designate and individual (hey, YOU, call the police now) to get emergency services headed in your direction.
Most people just sort of go blank. Eyes stare off into the distance, lips smack slowly, drool a bit. Looks a lot like someone who just had dental work and they're kind of out of it.  That's what happens with me. I get an aura before (just a weird sensation that I can't explain) so I usually go somewhere private. I don't have grand mals though. People with those you need to get them on the ground away from anything they can hit if possible. They'll just flail around some, not much you can do during.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYlylvJMUQY&feature=youtu.be) ya go. It's closer to the end.
Many female gas station clerks have hearts of gold and hands that could strangle a water buffalo. 
Certified Bro 
"I had a friend in college who had a seizure condition and when I asked her ""what's it like having a seizure?"" she said ""I'd love to be able to answer that, I really have no idea. My brain either checks out for the whole thing or just doesn't bother remembering it; All I know is I lose track of whatever I'm doing and the next thing I know, I'm on the floor trying to answer EMT questions while super spaced out, getting a headache, and feeling like my whole body is made of bread dough.""  I don't know if that's typical, though. A sample size of one isn't really enough data to make a general statement lol"
After watching the entire clip, I wasn‚Äôt entirely impressed by his sense of urgency.
In my experience, quality customer service is just when they attempt to help.
"I'd guess the cashier stood through the first time seeing someone having a seizure just the same - confused, helpless etc. We learn pretty quickly with exposure, though. It's just getting over that initial shock of ""this humman isn't functioning normally, no response algorithm found."" "
My mother has very easy to tell seizures.  She has memory issues. When the seizure comes then all you‚Äôve got to do is ask ‚Äúwhen‚Äôs your birthday‚Äù and you‚Äôll quickly find they get frustrated/confused.   For her, memory had always been a big tell.  Her first seizure came a day after she had obvious memory issues. If you are around friend or family that can‚Äôt remember the simplest thing for no reason whatsoever, keep a close eye on them for a day or two.   But really, we‚Äôre talking memory loss to seizure in anywhere between 2-60 minutes, let alone a full day like her first.   Just ask questions with simple answers if you ever suspect someone to be exhibiting signs of a potential seizure. The blank stare is fucking terrifying but nothing‚Äôs more scary than someone who can‚Äôt remember English, let alone the fact it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúcup‚Äù or a ‚Äúremote‚Äù or ‚Äúcat‚Äù/‚Äúdog‚Äù
I have this apending doom sensation when one is coming.  My body tells me its about to reboot like a computer. Really strange. I usually try to sit down asap or lay down. 
OH.MY.GOD that reporters voice.
bro
So I'm only one other person and have one experience but it was exactly like she said. Halloween this year I had a random seizure, never had one before & havent since. But basically it was like a time jump. Last thing I remember is talking to my coworker joking around as I climbed into my truck and then the next thing I knew I was in an emergency van waking up at hospital but I wasnt fully aware of what happened or fully conscious for like another half hour, just sort of going through motions. I remember my body sort of having that dough feeling too but it's hard to describe what it actually feels like, but that's an accurate odd description lol. From the time it happened to when I was actually aware of what happened was like an hour and a half. 
Dude almost looks like he‚Äôs just putting his items down to check out
A lot of epileptics are actually not allowed to have a drivers license, I think within a certain time frame of having a seizure. Its pretty common, over 60 million people have it
It‚Äôs good that you think this, as someone who tries hard in a service role, it really gets to me when I can‚Äôt find a solution or help someone and they get mad at me. 
Its more primal with babies. Mammels are so protective of young it throws us off when a mother lets her guard down. The baby in the video was was offered in a maternal way. Relaxed grip near another human was a desperate gesture for the mom realizing the worst is happening. You'd be surprised how instinctual taking that baby would be. Like yawning when someone else yawns. 
I had a classmate in jr high with epilepsy or something, she was new and had the teacher put her next to someone she trusted(me in this class).  That blank stare was the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced, she was writing and then her page tore from her pencil while she just stared like a zombie at it. 
[Why do Reporters...Talk...Like That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8IEhcN9aFo)
Kinda reminded me of Mrs Incredible. 
I'm assuming you aren't paid enough for what you do. 
Aw man. Its as close to the look of death that you‚Äôd ever get without actually looking at someone who‚Äôs dead.  Everything about seizures are terrifying but thank god its unlikely to leave any big time damage. I feel sorry for all the kids in your class but I guess it‚Äôs an important thing to learn about, it‚Äôs just nightmare fuel 
Non-regional diction... Maybe regional accents would distract the average American away from the story.  It does just sound American to outsiders.
Or Trisha Takanawa
I had a similar thing happen in 2015 in that I had a random seizure in my sleep and have not had another one since then. I had to have a whole lot of tests and my neurologist ultimately said that I didn‚Äôt have epilepsy and that the seizure had been triggered from a lack of sleep and dehydration. I had flown 16 hours from Sydney to LA, arrived at about 6:30am, went to Disneyland for the day and got back to the hotel around 11pm where I went straight to sleep. My seizure happened while I was asleep and it woke my sister in law who called 911. I don‚Äôt remember a single thing about the seizure and I only remember waking up in a hospital bed being rushed into the ER. I remember waking up with a terrifying feeling of not knowing where I was and what was happening. I‚Äôm now very careful about sleeping regularly when I‚Äôm travelling!
Yeah fuck this guy, he didn't immediately round the corner, drop his shit, catch the woman, and move an entire checkout counter out of the way for her to finish her seizure. How inconsiderate of him  The fuck
No where near my dude. Almost done with Uni tho, so should be out of here v soon
Didn't knew that couldn't be lethal when happened to my mom. We were both watching tv and she fell on my should already having a seizure. When she stopped with the eyes closed and the lips blue I legit cried because I thought my mom was dead. Turns out she had a minor episode ealier that week with her arm and ignored it, so please guys if you notice something odd happened to you search for help.

I sure hope this spreads enough that she hears about it.

My late husband ashes are in the lake and I can't get to the lakeside in my wheelchair anymore and gates are locked.  Have to drive back up north tonight. Thank you x"""
This is a great suggestion 
Honestly makes so happy there are still people with so much heart on this world.
If she put her husband‚Äôs ashes in there, you can be sure she will be back. See if you can get it laminated or something that will last longer than a piece of paper. Very sweet of you to do that.
yes

"""Guys, Dr. Christina is coming to unhook whoever needs it. Spread the word. Don't be a dick, don't bite her. We need her hands. """
"To befriend a shark in visible discomfort and immediately think, ""I'm going in!"" just for the sake of helping, is truly what makes humans bros. "
Did I read correctly? Other sharks started showing up with hooks? That is amazing 
I want to believe but this seems way too bonkers.  On the other hand, I had a stray cat approach me that had a rubber band tightly wrapped around its tail. As I attempted to take it off he just lied down, he meowed furiously but never attempted to swipe or bite me. After I got it off the cat just sorta sauntered away.  Maybe some animals do know when you're trying to help them.

Update: Sharks are better at showing gratitude than most humans
Why does OP have like 10 different posts on different subreddits that are all on the front page right now....
That's absolutely awesome. This is what makes me think sharks are cute. Then I remember jaws. But for like a real short moment I go, awwwwww...
What I think's most amazing here is that other sharks learned from that first shark's experience, that they used or valued the human as a means to remove hooks for them. And seemingly expressed submission or gratitude.
Imagine being in constant pain from a wound and some creature just comes up to you to take it away for no reason. I'd want to hang out with that thing forever.
Guts right there. I respect the fuck out of anyone who helps animals. Most of the time they don't get recognition. Not from humans, and most definitely not from the animals themselves.

Dude she just stole that sharks jewelry wtf
Maybe they thought she's another fish that grooms other fish. It would mean though that sharks communicate. 
They somehow seem to notice other sharks 'feeling better' after they where close to that specific (human, but they don't know that) being in the water... so they seek out help too. More animals show that kind of behaviour.      The remarkable thing is the docility the sharks show. Really unexpected for me.
Right??!! Thinking the same thing. 
Grew up on a few ranches, yes animals do know. Not all of them but some do know. Wild birds of prey and predators are particularly aware of your intentions and capabilities and will seek out a human for help at times. Meanwhile my cat still tries to slice my hand off when I brush him.
Some animals definitely understand what you are doing. There's a video of a dude helping an octopus somewhere  I can't remember, the little dude thanked him with a pat on his boot, very touching.  Edit: thx for the karma ‚ù§Ô∏è
I've heard stories like this about raccoons and other animals too, that they'll show up at people's doors in distress, and accept help with injuries or whatnot.

Jaws is a horrible representation of sharks. They're really not very dangerous to humans. Attacks are extremely rare, and most attacks are literally one bite and then the shark swims off when it realizes you're not food. Like, that's still devastating, but sharks attack people by mistake. 
no, but she deserves one. 
I doubt Karen will have a problem with that, know what I'm sayin?
"""Hello. My name is Bruce"""
Oh man, good to know with the chainmail, i could not grasp how one would put his arm in a shark
The odd thing I've found is that most individuals are a pretty mixed bag of wretched and wonderful
Of course they communicate, it's been ages they've been around
I saw an episode of Nova Science Now that showed proof that dolphins communicate.  As briefly as I can summarize it, they taught dolphins the command to do tricks together.  Then they taught them a command to do a new, never-before-seen trick.  Then they did both commands together.  Both dolphins dived underwater, clicked back and forth, then returned to the surface and simultaneously did a new trick.  It was awesome to see the dolphins talking to each other.
Most sharks are very docile. You just get a few breeds, like the tiger and bull shark, that are hyper aggresive.
"If you watch the new Planet Earth, they do a bit on reef ""cleaning stations"". Both predator and prey fish, including sharks, all know to show up to the same spot on the reef where special fish & shrimps live that help clean all the parasites and dead skin off them.  In exchange, the predators stay pretty chill, and cleaner fish/animals don't get eaten.  This isn't too far off from that concept...they obviously have some ability to recognize another animal that will help keep them healthy, and also some way to communicate that animal's presence to other sharks.  This lady is basically a giant cleaner shrimp in their eyes."
We had a cow give birth on our farm once too close to a creek and the calf slid down the bank. She actually ran up to the house to come and get us to help. Most amazing thing
https://youtu.be/rqAmR1lEN0I
Does anyone have a link to that tumblr post about humans basically being fey to animals, strangers from another world that may decide to help you on a whim, hunt and eat you, or ignore you. Take your children and raise them and they come back marked by their time amoung humans.
Also, being predators, it's not unreasonable to think they're intelligent enough to make that association especially since they don't really (at least not usually) consider humans to be food. It's kind of funny how we refer to the most violent animals as being vicious and mindless when predators tend to be smart. 
Wait.. This is an actual legit subreddit. WTF

Hullo Bruce
Yup, they almost have to be towed out of the water it is so heavy.   Also, sharks have memories and if you can get a few favorable to you, stuff like this happens.  You ever see shark boy? The real one? I cant find a link but a small kid grew up with sharks and he swam with them dailey.  Formed a fantastic bond. Was a small brown child wearing only goggle and pants if anyone can find it I think it was late 90s NAT GEO mag I saw it in.

And the great white, with its eyes... like a doll's eyes...
Like that animated movie where Will Smith plays a fish at a fishwash.   That's it, I'm convinced movies create reality. 
The crows/ravens where I live will try to drop their food into the street if they need it cracked open because they know a car will get the job done faster than they can.   I was coming home from work one day and I see one drop in and try to drop a walnut under my tire but it missed, so I pulled over and grabbed the walnut, put it on the sidewalk, and stamped on it with my foot, cracking it open. The crow landed on the sidewalk and I backed up. It looked at me and then at the walnut and it was like you could hear the gears turning in its head.  After a bit, it picked up part of the walnut, hopped over to me, and set it in front of me while looking at me, then hopped back and started eating the rest of the walnut. Corvids have been my favorite birds ever since.
I'm way too high for this shit.

Rocks are around even longer. They don‚Äôt communicate tho. 
Not a shark expert by any stretch, but most animals have evolved communication of some kind, whether conscious or not - especially those who have communities, as sharks do. Dolphins chatter and have extensive body language; fish use body language and also colour and chemical signals. Sharks might be somewhere in that spectrum?  It's reasonable to assume that since they live in groups, and communication typically favours survival of both group and individual genes, they have likely evolved with some kind of communication.  Now I want to Google shark language üòÑ  Edit: basic Googling tells me that they don't have any throat organs that can produce sound - they are a perfectly silent hunter. Scientists have established that they use complex body language to send signals around mating and group hierarchy. They also use their strong sense of smell, which is on the level of chemical communication. Researchers who study specific schools report recognition on the part of those they are studying. TIL: sharks are neat! 
"So can we assume dolphins have legitimate sentences then? They must have been talking to each other in very specific terms like not just ""back"" but ""swim on your back""!"
Great whites are very calm animals. You can see divers having a cool swim with them. The movie industry makes sharks look dangerous based on their shitty shark movies which we get every year. 
You got a bro got for life there, dude. You could even set up shop in your driveway on the weekends: one pop top per nut. You'd make a killing.
We have a crow that lives with us, its the weirdest thing. My dad fed it one day and ever since it follows us everywhere, flies with us when we walk the dogs, sits on the shed roof when were in the living room or in the garden when we‚Äôre in the kitchen, still wont let us within 20 feet of it but happily follows us around.  Hes super sad right now because he makes food stashes in the hedges and our labrador figured it out
You ate the walnut, right?
Wow
Even bots need those useless red arrows like the rest of us. Maybe we're not so different after all... 
They dont call her Jaws for nothing
"It's too dark for the higher powers to notice and go ""fuck. That. Imma smite that so hard""."

It looked like at the end of the gif the sharks were telling other sharks to show up to get their hooks removed, so you could have an army of sharks if you started your own hook removal service.
They are still predators and instinctual, so be advised.  Chainmail is a must.
Cause they ain‚Äôt got no madula oblongata 
I think it‚Äôs interesting that humans are so sceptical about language in other animals... and yet we are able to read basic body language of other animals (unless you‚Äôre an idiot.) like of course animals have some form of language, even if it isn‚Äôt as refined as us big tall naked apes.
It's worth noting that Dolphins echolocate. Based on our analysis of their brains, they have better visual processing than us. It's likely that they don't exactly have words for things so much as they replicate the sound of the object. It's like imagine if you naturally had a projector and could flash images on a wall. Telling someone else how to do a trick would be as easy as using youtube. It took us hundreds of thousands of years to invent video but dolphins never needed it.
"No, you shouldn't assume anything about their language at this point. They're clearly capable of communicating very precise ideas but whether or or not there is specific grammar or sentence structure, or even what might constitute a ""word"" is still unclear. "
Shark movies aren't shitty.  Sharknado was a great documentary.
>a killing  Don't you mean a murder? 
I'd consider it. A little inter-species diplomacy couldn't hurt.
Of course! Couldn't leave my new buddy and its token of friendship behind!

Man, as evil as it sounds, as a linguist, I would love a massive corpus of big-brother style surveilance of a pod of dolphins, their environments, and clicks recorded with high precision microphones indexed to the individual that produced them. See if we can find some sort of phonology, and correlation between phonological strings and their environment/social behaviour.

Back in the jackass days I would have never guessed that Steve-O would end up being the most put together respectable alumni.  I guess I never hear anything bad about Johnny Knoxville but with the fall of some of them and the rise of Steve-O, it stands out.
These are the kinds of things that should be really talked about. Not celebrities while they are spiraling. But ones like this who turn everything around. I know, that‚Äôs not where the money is. But this is what an actual success story looks like. Not having a hit movie or being the highest paid at whatever they do. But coming to this close to losing it all & having someone who loves you show you the way. And then actually going that way & making the choice to live. 
Steve o has really become an inspirational figure. I hope bam came pull it together
Can someone explain this photo to me? What does his have in his right hand and what are those blue things all over the table? 
I hope that everyone who has a drug addiction finds help one way or another and moves in a positive direction.

Nitrous oxide, oh yeah. Hundreds of capsules a day. Stuffing all that aluminum into your backpack and trying to discreetly recycle it. The infernal sound they make when they fall to the bottom a bin.

for you
Those are legal, aren't they? What kind of high do they give you? 
It‚Äôs odd to me that as somebody with deep pockets and a degenerate nitrous addiction Steve-O never formed a relationship with a nitrous filling center where he could just get 20lb tanks and weather balloons. Much more user friendly solution than using a head shop cracker and tons of tiny whipped cream chargers. That picture brings me back maaaaaan...

Yes; it‚Äôs a hard thing to watch.  For those that didn‚Äôt see it: Steve-O recorded a lot of his time getting extremely high by himself and talking to the camera. His behavior is shocking and he is completely disconnected from reality. Because of his open personality and love of the camera it is one of the most raw documentaries I‚Äôve ever seen in addiction, 
The game grumps episode with him is a good watch too. He touches on his sobriety. 
"You should also check out his book ""Professional Idiot: A Memoir"". It's a great read.  Steve-O should honestly be dead, it's a damn miracle that he is still alive."
Also just lucky to be a coherent human with basic cognitive functions still intact 
I was on a very bad path of drug addiction at one point in my life and one day I did a high dose of acid with a friend and we ended up watching that documentary. It was so hard to watch and see ourselves in him. That trip and the resulting epiphany was the only time I'm glad I did drugs because it made me wake up and change.
Just looked up BAMs latest news. DUI in January. He‚Äôs not been good for quite some time. 
I have to respect Knoxville. Dude cashed in on his 15 minutes and got out. It would have been easy to fall into the Tom Green/Andy Dick dumpster fire of trying to be relevant after your prime.
Britney Spears seems to be fine these days, and I've always been curious about her recovery story, but people just focus on the breakdown.
But that doesn't sell as much and doesn't get as much viewers.  Media isn't here to inform and take care of you, it's here to make money
One step at a time
Yep. I believe Bam just got out of rehab too. There was an interesting video I saw about him last year about what he's been up to lately and him kinda spiraling out of control. It might have been part of Epicly Later'd but I'm not sure.
The thing in his hand is a whipped cream canister, that in this case is lacking in cream as he is using it to take whipits. Those blue cartridges contain nitrous oxide and go in the whipped cream canister, when inhaled the user gets a brief but intense and euphoric high.  
I've been sober for 8 months, but another one of my friends OD'd on Thursday.  Some people make it out, some don't. Unfortunately that's just how it is.   If you have friends struggling (either with substances or other issues) I urge you to reach out to them, because sometimes the hardest thing to do, even when you know you need help, is to actually find yourself help.
I like this lower-key, more mature Steve-O.  Good for him.
Could not stop smiling watching that.  Lucky dog and lucky guy. :)
[Here's the podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDOr9UY-yk)  
You‚Äôre a big guy
I've learned a new drug combo *and* a new term today. Everything's coming up Milhouse!
On shrooms and nitrous I met God, and I'm not even religious.  Nitrous and LSD I watched the room turn into melty kaleidoscopes, nitrous and Molly felt like I was having a full body psychedelic orgasm.   Nitrous and a hefty dose of ketamine is where shit gets weird.  I got transported out of my body, into space, created a universe and then watched myself get born into the universe I had just made.   tl;dr: when doing drugs, nitrous is the cheese to my wine
Wom wom wom wom 
Wawawawawawawawawaaaaaaawaaaa
They are legal.  We would order then on amazon or buy them from the head shop.  The high is very short like 30 seconds to a minute but when you start chaining them together it can get pretty intense.   You have little epiphany‚Äôs about whatever you‚Äôre thinking about or whatever people around you are talking about, but you can never verbalize your amazing thought which fades a few seconds later.  The only way to get it back is by doing more whip it‚Äôs which is how these things can get so addictive.  Doing whip it‚Äôs will tripping is fucking insane.  It‚Äôs by far the most intense drug experience I‚Äôve ever had.  You can loose yourself in weird space time loop crazy shit.
"I tried it for the first time the other day accidentally just fucking around after finishing a whipped cream bottle.   It's a pretty instant rush of euphoria. Similar to weed, but harder and faster. Your voice also gets deeper, which is funny. I think the first thing I said was ""*Now* I get why people do this!"" while laughing my ass off. "
A very very very short one. I've had a blast on nitrous but it's essentially just glorified huffing, for some reason people don't judge as much when you're doing it from a cracker/balloon instead of a can/bottle  Edit: sooo I'm gonna go ahead and post this link here that is a very good article on nitrous, which is an incredibly interesting substance. It details its uses, why exactly it's so safe especially relative to other drugs, some interesting stuff about how it affects brain waves... but most importantly which also breaks down some of the dangers with both short-term-high-quantity usage as well as chronic exposure to even minute quantities. I use drugs regularly but I'm a very firm believer in harm reduction and being as informed as possible about what's going into your body and how important it is to know the possible side effects of abuse. I'm especially worried about some of the responses below that say you can do it every day as long as you take a B12 vitamin.... definitely NOT recommended haha  http://www.medicaldaily.com/nitrous-oxide-side-effects-eeg-test-shows-laughing-gas-alters-brainwaves-3-minutes-341632  This article from Anaesthesia Progress: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2614651/  is the one they get the information about negative side effects of abuse and chronic exposure from
> ...ever seen in addiction,              More people in addiction should watch it. 
Also the H3 podcast with him, his stories are crazy and fascinating.
I read that whole book in a day. Steve-O is one crazy motherfucker. Also a huge inspiration... if he can get sober, anyone can. 
Friend of mine abused drugs. If you didn't know him a decade ago, you'd probably think he's just a little weird, but he used to be one of the sharpest people I knew, now he's just vague all the time. Zones out a lot and can't follow conversations at all. 
Steve-O: Demise and Rise
Losing basically a brother/best friend will do that to you
he did had a kid, I watch that family bootcamp show and was totally in shock. He didn't even looked like Bam. I think he looks healthier now but it's clear his addiction to alcohol won't be an easy battle for him. :( It's difficult to see the hurt in his eyes
He tore his urethra in 2009, and he had to flush it with fluids twice a day for three years following the injury so scar tissue wouldn't form and necessitate lifetime catheterizing.  Must have been a terrible three years, but at least he didn't have to do it forever. 
A large part of her recovery was that she had what amounted to a guardian appointed to keep her in line and handle what she couldn‚Äôt. Sort of like half manager half parent, while trying to teach her to handle things herself. That person was also responsible for cutting out all the negative people she associated with previously.   IIRC it was her dad at first, and then once she was in a more mentally stable and healthy place, they revoked it guardianship with the condition that it would come back if she fucked around again. So far, so good. 
Then BAM
He went sober for a while but relapsed and got a DUI in January. Just got out of rehab for it, so hopefully his sobriety returns
I *thought* that looked like a whipped cream canister but wasn't sure what that had to do with drugs. Thanks for the TIL.  That would explain the paroxysm Steve-O is having in the photo. 
It would be extremely painful
Used to do nitrous balloons from an industrial tank while ‚Äòcandyflipping‚Äô every weekend back in the day (acid and ecstasy at same time).  Then smoke hash to come down.  The good old illegal warehouse rave days in late 90s....  Those were good, and ridiculous, times.  Life is much more tame these days haha.
"I'll never forget the time I took 400mg of dextromethorphan and just laid on the floor flying through space while listening to techno music for over four hours lol. At one point I actually forgot that I was a person. My whole existence was just this being flying through space. When I came to I actually had to stop and say out loud ""My name is JLD2k6 and I'm a person"" because I was shocked to find out that I was a human being this whole time. I am not sure but I imagine that is what they call ego loss. It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.   "
Wawawawawawawawawawawawawa
This is the most accurate description of whippits 
> You have little epiphany‚Äôs about whatever you‚Äôre thinking about or whatever people around you are talking about, but you can never verbalize your amazing thought which fades a few seconds later.  Hahaha yup, trying to remember those once you come down is impossible.
He's been on Joe Rogan's podcast two or three times as well, definitely worth a watch / listen. 
I agree that he's a huge inspiration, and I'm not trying to be nitpicky here, but I think it's important to mention. The idea that X person was able to get sober and that means that anyone can is really reductive and unhelpful, particularly for people who are new in sobriety. Just wanted to get that perspective out there because I hear it a lot and see it a lot on Reddit, not at all out of malice, but just a lack of understanding I think. Again, not trying to be rude, just wanted to mention that, and I agree with your comment otherwise.  
Yeah. I feel for that; but people lose others all the time. At some point you have to call it what it is: addiction.
He looked like Phil last I saw him. 
If i'm not mistaken his voice is messed up from doing them
"Yes, in a manner of speaking. It can limit the amount of oxygen reaching your brain to a point that you can pass out and stop breathing.  The slang for that around here is ""fishing out"" because your lips turn blue."
The butane is probably for torches to do dabs. Unless people huff butane too idk
If I take that mask off, will you die?
Sometimes I regret not trying more stuff out when I was freer. Then I remember I can still be one of those old hippies at Burning Man if I still have the regret later on.
Which makes me think it's just stimulating the kinda reward center associated with an epiphany but there's no substance to it
Almost 2 years without a drink here, and the one video I kept going back to in early sobriety was [Craig Ferguson's monologue](https://youtu.be/7ZVWIELHQQY) when he talks about his own drinking and what he sees in Britany Spears, of all people.  Just very open and honest.
Male 18-25 podcast subscription starter pack
His Hot Ones interview is great as well!
Such a good point. Will-power/motivation/etc. of course are needed, but in many many situations you also need plenty of support from your environment and the people in your life. Being rich (or having rich friends/family) really helps too.  I don't think it minimizes Steve-O's growth to acknowledge all the factors that helped him get to where he is now. He comes off as a pretty humble dude so I wouldn't be surprised if he would be the first to point out the positive factors in his life that pushed him towards sobriety.  Everyone's situation is different and I don't think it's useful to compare scenarios without considering the wider context.
The drug abuse and addiction probably arose / were exacerbated by the loss. Many people lose others but those many people don't have millions of dollars, few responsibilities and access to as many drugs as they can consume.
I think he feels responsible for his death.   If I recall correctly they were in a tough car accident when they were young, Ryan Dunn was driving and he crashed the car and almost killed everyone.   He kinda failed to get him to get his shit together and maybe their stupidity / recklessness made things worse for Ryan's behaviour.   The feeling of guilt is devastating.
Oh it‚Äôs not an excuse at all, but that‚Äôs what it is regarding Bam. 
He made a stunt with a bike, a failed stunt where he fell with the bike falling on top of him, mainly on his dick.
Because he would do hundreds a day
No one cared who I was till I put on the mask
Of course man! I kid you not it's starting to be less and less teens at burning man nowadays... I literally only run into mid 20s early 30s folk anymore at festivals.
I have read that that is indeed an effect of psychedelics. It lowers your ‚Äúepiphany threshold‚Äù so everything is fucking unbelievable like you‚Äôre on some new planet 
"According to a teacher I had in high school, Steven King once had a high epiphany and wrote it down before passing out, only to wake up and find he wrote ""feet go in shoes."""
Craig Ferguson is the best, his monologues on his addiction are so profound and his recovery inspiring. He had so many powerful moments on his show, like the eulogies for his mother and father and his interview with Archbishop Desmond Tutu.  Congrats on your recovery.
On my 2nd day of detox on God knows how many relapses. Starting to wonder if I can beat it. You and people like him give me hope
>**Every** Hot Ones interview is great as well!  FTFY
what a jackass
It doesn't mean he's exercising those powers.
I thought it was from inhaling directly, since that can give you frostbite.
Batman!
They're so damn expensive!
Sometimes big problems have really obvious solutions however and it becomes instinct to run away from them. That's the core of anyone that truly grows from psychedelic usage, It doesn't have to be about meeting machine elves. Confronting yourself and taking it seriously can be a big enough epiphany for personal growth. Sometimes people just need perspective and wonder injected back into their life.. 
Check out r/stopdrinking too, if you haven't already. I've had many, many day 2's, but today is my first day 677, and I tell ya- it gets better. Everything gets better. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat. I won't drink with you today!
A couple years before I got sober a few friends and I were on MDMA and decided to take some whippets straight out of the canister. I remember feeling really weird about it and as we were going around the circle two of my friends started seizing when they did it. The guy I was dating at the time said it felt like when he was brought back to life by paddles when he tried to kill himself. It was the first time I realized I might have a drug problem and never touched whippets again.. it took me a couple more years to hit bottom but man.. drugs are scary stuff. Especially when you're uneducated about them, as I was.   Addiction is no joke. But there is a solution. It's just a matter of seeking it out and putting in the work. Whoever might read this, you're worth it. Whether you believe it or not.   You. Are. Worth it. 
Not gonna lie, I'd feel incredibly honoured if a kid would do this to me.
My neighbor‚Äôs kids are like this toward me. We play outside, talk about both our cats and I let her help me garden. Not gonna lie it‚Äôs pretty nice knowing there‚Äôs someone looking up to you. I didn‚Äôt have anyone like that growing up so I‚Äôm glad I can be that kind of somebody to a kid
"Believe it or not, my father in law gets this all the time.  Every time I'm over there in the summer, at some point the neighbor kids start to congregate on the front lawn and eventually one will come knock on the door and say, ""Can Pawpaw come out?"" His big thing is to play a very loud, heavily modified version of baseball in the yard, with him as pitcher.  Everybody ends up participating, even grownups."
When I was a kid there was this old lady next door. Not gonna lie, she was my best friend for a couple of years. This is when my parents and I moved to a different country and I didn't know anybody. I'm extremely allergic to cats and she had 4 of them, so whenever I used to go to her house my face would puff up and I couldn't breathe properly but despite that, I would continue to go until we finally moved. Damn, thinking about this now brings a tear to my eye especially since I know she has passed away by now because she was like 90 back then. Wherever you are now Anne, I hope you know that you made some of the hardest years of my life bearable and that you will always hold a special place in my heart.
This is so wholesome  Reminds me of the story my parents' Dalmatian they got when they moved into their first house. She loved kids and was trained to stay on the property so when she saw any kids around the neighborhood she'd run full tilt to the edge of the yard to see them, tail wagging furiously. But it scared them away so the next time she crawled along on her belly as close as she could until they came over to pet her. After that the kids would regularly come knock on the door to see if Abbie could come out to play <3
It takes a village. Positive influences can come from anywhere.
The most I get is frantic little knocks on my door saying ‚ÄúMiss Marri we accidentally hit a ball into your yard again can we have it back before your gross dog eats it‚Äù
Kids need role models like this.  People that will give them time and attention, that aren‚Äôt parents, to show them what healthy relationships look like.  My mom and I shared one of our role models. A nun in our town.  When each of us were little she would let us garden with her, and if we cleaned the bird bath she would give us root beer barrels.
Ok so this reminds me of me and the other kids back in the 80s.   We grew up playing street football. Loved that shit. Back in 3rd and 4th grade we could t throw the long bombs very well.   One day, this black dude moves in to the neighborhood. His name was Marvin and he was a postal worker. We were a neighborhood of white kids. One day he sees us playing and asks if we need a ‚Äúpermanent quarterback‚Äù. Yes! Omg.   So I guess he played I. High school and/or college. Dude was strong as shit and he had alllll these plays. He‚Äôd design plays with us by the curb. I‚Äôd be a bottle cap or a stick or whatever. He told us how to block and do juke moves. The stutter steps.   So we play with Marvin for the next few years. We‚Äôd go by and ask if he could play. He always did. He was a huge dolphins fan and he always called me ‚Äúduper‚Äù because I think one of the Miami receivers was Duper.   Anyway, I‚Äôm 47 years old now and Marvin must be dead or in his eighties by now. Anyway, your husband is gonna be remember by those kids for decades. I‚Äôll never forget Marvin.
Growing up in my neighborhood we had a group of about 20 kids and 4 or 5 dads that would meet up outside almost every night to toss footballs around, play soccer, or play tag/wrestling.   I wonder if this type of thing still occurs. You learn a lot about socializing and making friends from close group activity.
Happened to me many years back...  we had a neighborhood BBQ on a Sunday and it was a real hot day and water guns and hoses came out.  I may or may not have dumped a bucket of water from an upstairs bathroom out the window on two kids in the driveway (ok... I did) .  I won't lie... it was fun and the night ended with s'mores, ice pops, and sparklers.   Went to work the next day and my wife called me to say six kids came over around 10am to ask if I could come out to play.   The best part was they called her 'Mrs' and referred to me with my first name.
Same
When I was in high school the neighbor kid did this too me.  I was like fuck it and went out and played with him. His older sister was my age and told everyone at school I play with little kids.   feelsbad
I had a neighbor growing up (\~4-8 years old) who looked like a typical grouchy old dude. Taught me how to grow watermelons, and was the kindest guy around. Absolute gem of a neighbor. Still think of him every time I eat watermelon.
Having adults like this in a child's life is actually quite beneficial!  There was a recent article that said one of the key factors to having a good childhood/better mental health as an adult was to have two non-parent adults that were interested in them!  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-athletes-way/201909/seven-early-experiences-potential-benefits-in-adulthood](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-athletes-way/201909/seven-early-experiences-potential-benefits-in-adulthood)
My dad is a gardener and in the front garden he‚Äôs made this mini jungle with little shrubs and rocks. He put a goat at the edge of this large rock with lions surrounding the poor thing. He also used my red nail polish on the dinosaurs mouths to make them look like they are fighting each other. The kids next door always knock on the door to get my dad to come out to play and show them the garden and teaches them about the animals! Also we have a African grey parrot, 2 rag doll cats and a tortoise which the kids love to look at and learn about. The happy look on my dads face when he‚Äôs with them is the cutest thing ever!
So you‚Äôre teaching her how to steal and plant cacti right?
That is amazing! Keep it up <3
that sounds hilarious and wholesome, good on him!
"I had one of those! Her name was Dorothy. She lived across the street from my grandma and had a basement full of all of the toys her grandkids outgrew. There was a huge model train set, several dollhouses with homemade furniture, a giant tub full of dolls and another one filled with homemade clothes. Plus, she had cats and dogs and a really grumpy ferret.  I'd spend two to three nights a week at my grandma's house, and I'd always ask to go play at Dorothy's. My grandma, who'd known her for half of forever, always told me ""Yes, but don't make a nuisance of yourself, and you come straight back home when she tells you it's time to go.""   Dorothy NEVER told me it was time to go, and usually my grandma would come collect me after a couple hours. During that time, I'd entertain myself in the basement, eating the cookies Dorothy would bring down for me. Sometimes I'd go upstairs and sit in the ""parlor"" with her. (She called it the parlor. It looked like a regular ol' living room to young me.) She'd pull down these huge, dusty photo albums from the bookshelf and show me blurry black and white pictures of her family and tell me stories about them.  And then...my mother found out. She screamed at my grandma for hours for letting me go to ""some crazy old lady's house"" unsupervised. My grandma tried to tell her that she'd known Dorothy for 20 years or better but mom didn't care and I didn't get to go to my grandma's for quite a while.  By the time my mother got over herself and let me spend nights with my grandma again, Dorothy had passed away and a new family was living in that big white house across the street.  It's been 25 years or so now, and Gram is gone, too...but sometimes I still drive by and remember all the fun I had there."
‚ù§
memories keep those kind of people alive, thank you for sharing about Anne, she sounded delightful!
This. It doesn't matter his father situation. He looks up to a person I know is a good role model.
Kudos to that fella for stepping in as a father figure.
His older sister is a bitch.
Hell yeah, I had shirtless, crabby looking, but heart of gold old neighbor too. He was a funny bastard and loved him some college football. Still miss him and I'm closer to his age than a kid now.
His entire family is very community focused.
Who says the kids dad isn't just like... At work?
A valuable trait in any era.
If his father's at work in the day and the kid wants to play, now he has a day-dad too
"Lmao. Like the night Dad comes home and finds his son still wants to play ball and he's like ""Fuckin' morning shift..."""
Day Dad.  Fighter of the Night Dad.  Champion of the sun.  He's a master of karate and friendship for everyone.
Champion of the son*
When my mom had my brother we were living in a very small town in Inyo country ca. She had just moved there as a single mother of two with one on the way based upon the name of the town.   I was 5 and my sister was 6.  We wanted to throw her a party when she returned from the hospital so we went to each of our neighbors and invited them. We also informed each neighbor what items to bring (cake, food etc), we sat and tore up newspapers for confetti with neighbor kids.   The party was a success.   That town was really supportive of my family for the years we were there. It a good place.  Edit:  Thank you for the silver! Edit 2: howdy stranger thanks for the gold!
We have had a neighbor across the street when I was growing up who was retired. I use to love going over just to watch him work on his late 80s Jeep. He was rebuilding the engine, rewiring everything. I would constantly bug him with questions, he would answer every one of them and to the best of his ability try to get my 10 year old mind to understand it. I remember my mom told me to stop bothering me and told me I couldn‚Äôt go over anymore. After like a week he came by the house to check up on me to see if I was ok because he was worried. He spoke with my parents and assured them I was no trouble and finally I was allowed back over. That man set me on a path in life; I work on airplanes for a living now. I remember him and his wife becoming good friends with my parents and they even came to my oldest sisters wedding. Some neighbors are the best.  Edit: Thank you for silver kind stranger!
Wish I knew this tactic when I was a kid, I'd have had so many cookies
^it's ^not ^her ^birthday ^tomorrow
When I was a kid (5ish years old) I would get my parents in trouble.  I‚Äôd grab a stick and walk up and down the brick fence that would divide our property with our neighbours.   ‚ÄúJAAACK!! JOOOAAAAN!!‚Äù I would call until they came out for a chat.  I usually didn‚Äôt have to wait long, often they would be out gardening and I would pepper them with questions.  I don‚Äôt remember what we spoke of, but my mum told me to stop bothering them and they told her off.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a boy let him be curious‚Äù they‚Äôd say.  One story I remember Jack telling me that he was a world war vet (before I understood what this was) and he would use rubbish bin lids as bullet shields.  I thought he was the coolest and I just wanted to talk to them all the time.  They would have long passed, it‚Äôs been 30 years since this memory and they were already elderly, but I remember these two people so vividly.  I miss them a lot and I barely even knew them
Good neighbor peeps
Use to live across from people my family knew for like 40 years.  One day when family was out of town, they asked if they could get some water because something at their place was being repaired.  For two days they came and grabbed buckets and buckets of water.  On the third day, their grand kid came over and raised my fridge. An hour later they popped by and we were watching movies.  She was supposed to invite me to their sons birthday bbq.  So in exchange for water I got grilled foods and cake.
"On my 11th birthday I had about 9 or 10 friends over, and we ran around the neighborhood playing ""Murder in the Dark"". Which is like an extreme hide and go seek game where the seeker ""kills"" the hider and the other hiders find them and start an investigation to try to catch the killer. All the while the killer trys to silently take down the other hiders without being caught. Well it was December in East Tennessee, so it was dark around 6:30 or so. So about 7-8 we're running through my neighborhood playing and having fun, as children do, and unbeknownst to us there was a van following us around. My neighbor who always sat in his yard drinking and working on Jeeps called the law on the van and the police nabbed him. He was arrested as a felon in possession of firearms. He had two guns in the van. My parents told me about this years later, but I'm glad that I had a neighbor watching out for us neighborhood kids."
This comment deserves its own post.
Are you still in contact with him?  Sounds like a swell guy.
There was a child molester next door as I was growing up. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt know this tactic.
"It deserves its own subreddit. /r/INYO/       EDIT:  And ‚Ä¶ it has already has one. It says *""Here you can ask everyone's opinion on anything!""* and I'm the 3rd subscriber.     /u/mothermedusa/ here's your chance to be the first poster."
He was awesome. I loved working on that Jeep with him and it‚Äôs some of my best memories from childhood. My mom and him send Christmas cards every year but he moved away shortly after his wife passed away in 2002.
If you can, you should let him know his impact on your life. I'm sure he'd love to hear it.
you have created history I would give you gold if I could afford it
I do plan to write him my own Christmas card/letter this year.
Don't wait my friend. Do it sooner if you can. Sometimes people need a little happiness right before the holidays.
I love reading this one every time.  It never gets old.
This isn't simply a manager, this is a Leader.
This is my first time reading this, but it warmed my heart. This guy truly deserves a #1 Boss mug.
I really like this post but I always feel bad for the few who didn't get a job by the end of the week
I think this is so important as a manager. I used to hire a lot of contract help. They knew the job was only for several months, but people were let go from the project one at a time. I always kept a list of other employers who were looking for talent in our field and did resume tune-ups.  I had people move on to dozens of different companies. It wasn't why I did it, but many of those people stay in touch with me, decades later. Something that takes very little time on the part of a manager can literally change the trajectory of a young person's career.
OP here. Still at the next job I got making around a third more than I was. I work in government contracting and jobs come and go frequently in the business. Contracting companies are awarded contracts and lose contracts all the time often with little to no notice. It is a risky business. The only folks in my line of work that seem to have issues when this comes up are the older folks (sadly). Most of the folks had jobs by the end of the next week, but a few ended retiring early. Always have your resume up to date folks.
What a wonderful way to turn a fail into a win.   On a side note I wonder how many people are meant. 4? 40? 400?
Since the last time I saw it something occurred to me:   #This should be public policy.  There should be a regulation that if you're doing a layoff you need to give the employees a paid day for organizing recommendations and resume updates as well as access to your place of business and soon-to-be-former-colleagues.
It gets me every time,man! It still makes my heart warm no matter how many times I've read it.
+1.  A boss (or CO) is someone you obey because you have to.  A leader is someone who's direction you take you because you believe in them.  E: Thanks for gold, you sexy, anonymous redditor, you!
Maybe they got it the next week
OP here. It's 5 years later... A few gave up and retired early. I know at least 2 that did.
The BroBel prize ? ü§î

In the end he was in the same boat as them. It might be a different tone or acceptance of help if he kept his job and had to fire everyone else.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going with.
Would these work?  ‚ÄúThere should be a regulation that if you're doing a layoff you need to give the employees a paid day for organizing recommendations and resume updates as well as access to your place of business and soon-to-be-former-colleagues.‚Äù
Reminds me of that picture of a Boss pointing forward while the workers drag his chariot along like they're horses, and then a Leader pointing forward while at the front of the pack pulling right with his workers
Or they died within the crushing grip of poverty
Often when employees are laid off they are followed to their desk by either a manager or security and then walked out of the building. The employer does not want to give them any opportunity to steal or in some way ruin something. Its bullshit, employers should help workers in this situation but they absolutely would not.

The cold was just an excuse. He just wanted to eat more cookies than is reasonable to ask for
"This was all according to his evil plan.  First, buy up all the girl scout cookies in the area.  Now that he's eliminated the competition, he's got a monopoly, so he can drive up the prices and make a killing.  EVIL UPDATE: No joke, the guy was [just arrested for conspiracy to commit drug smuggling](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/26/viral-girl-scout-cookie-buyer-faces-federal-drug-charges/2997284002/), and  police have confiscated ""cash and assets"".    Clearly, once the police saw he had all the Samoas and Thin Mints, their only option was to take him down.

$540? Jesus that's like 15 whole boxes 
Me trying to flex after getting my tax return
That was a cool and classy act.  This is why I would like to have throw away money.
As a past Girl Scout mom, I love this but I also hate this. I love what he did, I hate the cookie program. 
I'm glad the actual girl scouts were there, when I see a couple moms or dads slinging cookies with no girl scouts around I wonder if they realize they're defeating the entire purpose of selling the cookies
Is this guy famous? Or is it just some dude passing by?   Not that it matters, I just see a lot of names being thrown around and I'm confused.    Nice act though.
can‚Äôt believe these girls met terry crews 
"""I'm eating for the kids"" "
It‚Äôs like when I go to the drive through to absolutely crush some burgers and nugs, but order two drinks to put them off the scent so I don‚Äôt look like the disgusting pig I am. 
Take them to work and sell them for $6-$7 a box. PROFIT. 
You aren't far off, its 132, same thing really.
Yes I would like one tax return's worth of girl scout cookies please.
"I would hardly call $540 worth of Girl Scout Cookies ""throw away money."" That's a sound investment, friend."
I am a mom of a Girl Scout currently and I hate cookie season too! Ugh
Unfortunately, the purpose has becone making money. A lot of troops don't care how they get it.
I must have bought from this one dad at work a good $100 worth of thin mints. 
Fun fact about boy scout popcorn.  Only about a quarter out of every dollar goes to your local troop when you buy it.  The rest is split between the local council executives office and the manufacturer of the popcorn.  If you legitimately want to help your coworker send their kid to summer camp, it is expensive, you are better off making a straight donation to the troop.  Unless you really like overpriced above average popcorn.  Grew up in boy scouts with my dad as our leader.  We didn't do the popcorn sale because there are a multitude of better ways to raise money for the troop.
"""Here's your -523 boxes of girl scout cookies."""
Yeah, you then take those cookies, go to the nearest college campus and then flip ‚Äòem to the stoners for twice the price.
As someone who still fondly remembers selling cookies with my mom, thank you for putting up with it for your kid! 
Basically legal drugs that you're guilted into buying with the smile of a little girl and pestering from the parents but also you're addicted to them so it's not like they even have to try. Also they'll be on front of every fucking business you try to go into. Pet store? They're there. Groceries? There by the thousands. 
I mean I'm assuming the funds go towards funding trips or something of the sort, but is that the sole purpose of it?  I've always found it shitty to have kids selling products that at the end of the day are just profiting some company while they get free labor.
Shit, you work with Doublemint Dave?
"We sold newspapers for our local church to make money, and occasionally our troop leader would find us ""yard jobs"" where we would go help elderly residents of our town with cleaning up their yard. They'd give a donation to our troop."
"""Cookie Duuude"""
Also very important to just teach the kids to (politely) talk to strangers! And possibly the working for what you get ethic 
"The ability to talk to people is one of the biggest differentiators in the workplace, especially among the more analytical fields. I have gotten opportunities beyond my education or experience based entirely on the ability to have a conversation with strangers and ""important people"" like a grown-up."
I'm honestly not trying to be an asshole but wouldn't there be a market for an athletic type of Hijab?    It sounds like an SNL skit but something that can cover her hair properly and cling tight but breathe isn't that too hard to come up with.
Did play stop or did they do this with the ball still live?
This is very touching. Women supporting women :)  Edit: with all due respect to the people commenting on how the hijab is a symbol of oppression for women (I understand  where you‚Äôre coming from), the reasoning behind people wearing it is very different for each person.   For example, my one friend who wears a hijab is the only girl in her family to wear it. Her mother and father have actually asked her to not wear it out of fear that someone may assault her for outwardly practicing her religion.   To assume all women who wear head coverings are being forced to, is discrediting their autonomy.   Not to say there aren‚Äôt people who are forced, but there are many who do choose to do this to honor their Allah.   If we want to support women and the their body their choice notion, we also have to support their religious freedom and how they exercise that. And for women who are forced to wear hijabs, they also deserve emotional support-instead or making them feel ashamed for their situation. :)
Without context this just looks like the ultimate form of intimidation and flexing.  Edit them to be in T-poses
Is it normal for a muslim like me to hate hijabs?
All of these comments are so nice it‚Äôs so heartwarming to read. I play footie and half of my team is made up of muslims, atheists and agnostic chuds like myself. It‚Äôs an amazing group of guys and our races and religion is the last things we think about.
What is wrong with society when a woman showing her hair is taboo?
The forced wear of Hijabs are human rights violations
That is quite lovely....
Not trying to be rude, i‚Äôm just ignorant. Why can they not show their hair?
Wholesome, but utter bullshit that she has to wear it in the first place
What team is it?
At first I thought she was a pitch invader they were trying to stop.
That's the kind of respect every single human deserves.
Nike sells them! She just may not have had access to one!
Yeah there is, one of the girls at our crossfit gym has them.  It still seems hot to me in the summer but it's probably nice now that it's in the 50s.
It looks like the ball went out of the boundary line, but she stopped to fix her hijab possibly before it crossed the line? So it would have been out of play while this happened.
That's my question as well. I'm all for her religious expression, but I'm also very competitive and a mid match stoppage so a player can fix her head cover would be infuriating.
Just ladies celebrating ladies
Probably. Religions are full of people who dislike a given aspect of it.
God willing we can build a better world for our children. <3
What is wrong with society when a woman showing her nipples is taboo?
Religion
Have you ever actually spoken with a Muslim woman who chooses to wear the hijab? Sure, some have oppressive parents who force them to wear it, just like my parents dragged me to church.  But many also choose to wear it as a reflection of their faith. It is dangerous to make assumptions about people. But it is fun to listen to them and ask questions.
That was the opposing team that shielded her.
There goes my retirement idea.  Thanks Nike.
"""Product page no longer available""."
Isn‚Äôt the material generally like a light fabric that would be pretty breathable?
Yeah if play stopped I‚Äôd be all for this. Honestly though if I was on that pitch, I‚Äôd play to the whistle.
I mean clearly she values her religious beliefs over a sport, and there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone has different values and she so happens to value her religion over soccer. So who cares? Players clearly didn't mind.
Gals being pals
I hate many parts of my religion ngl.
I agree, free em both.
What's wrong with society when flossing with pubic hair is taboo?
"We need to be allowed to remind each other that we only hear from those who have the option to not. Not those who have to. By default.   The voices of those most oppressed shouldn't be silenced because some women view that oppression as an accessory.   If they were allowed to say ""I don't want to wear it"", they wouldn't be wearing it."
Its conditioning. They‚Äôve been told since birth it is the only acceptable way
You've always got that career as a writer for SNL to fall back on.
No need to worry if you HAD invested lebron James would have just come along and sold you out to China.
There's also the fact that for years their shoes were made with what was basically slave labor. So yeah Nike's not great.
Oh no :(   On the bright side I went digging and found a few for anyone looking!   [sukoon active ](https://www.sukoonactive.com/products/hawa-hijab)  [leia ](https://www.leiashop.com/shop)  [asiya sport](https://www.asiyasport.com/collections/sports-hijabs)
Yupp! It‚Äôs basically like underarmour‚Äôs climacool fabric- very light, breathable, and wicked!
The way 18 watches the ball and then looks at her opponent, I‚Äôd say she watched it go out of bounds. And the way the player on the ground doesn‚Äôt immediately jump up.
Chicks..not being dicks
Ovaries before brovaries
Then why are you still that religion?
I was raised strictly as a Christian and grew to hate it deeply.  I still can't stand Christianity, but I've gained an appreciation for the teachings of Jesus on the whole.  The only thing wrong with religion is the people running it.
Dude, our teenage girls basketball team has those. Since it's Indonesia sport hijabs are an essential
True. Pursuit of the play completely stops. What amazing sportsmanship and a show that competition can bring us closer as people!
This is very touching. Women supporting women :)
Chicks before pricks
There may be many parts they love! Grew up Jewish and am an atheist but I still sometimes go to high holiday services. The sense of community and shared experiences with the people around me, regardless if I know them well or not, is incredibly comforting.

That cross walk is a friggin mile long!
Who only gave this girl one crutch
Love the part where she tells the car that WHOA!! YOU WAIT TILL I FINISH HERE! Totally cool post
r/whyweretheyfilming if not for /r/scriptedasaingifs
A zebra crossing ending in bushes across the street.  This is how you know your smart city planning.
the fact that the crosswalk doesn‚Äôt lead to any kind of sidewalk bothers me so much
r/scriptedasiangifs
Plot twist :  She's a pickpocket
And it ends in a bush?
Common in China. Sometimes you have to stay on an island in the middle to wait for another round of the lights.
Exactly what I was thinking. You get two for a reason
It‚Äôs China‚Äôs One Crutch Policy.
She's using it on the wrong side. When you use a single crutch, you're supposed to keep it on the side of the good leg, that way you lean off of the bum leg.
I know, was it honking? WTF.
Definitely....why was this being filmed?
It is for sure /r/scriptedasaingifs, why? That social credit score isn't going to increase itself.
no bench for respite.  Keep hobbling!
r/unexpectedbush  EDIT: Wow thank you for the silver. My first award ever. I'd like to thank by 2am stoned mind for this.
But what if once you get to the middle you're suddenly transported to a nightmare world where the cars won't stop coming and you can never safely cross and the longer you wait the faster the cars become until there's just a blur that'd macerate you if you attempted to leave the barren waste of a traffic island that's become your home for the rest of your life.
All your replies--gone, reduced to atoms.
This is /r/WhyWereTheyFilming bullshit. It was staged for some reason. Probably to see if anyone would help her.
They actually gave her two but one was female so she threw it out
"But she doesn't have a ""bum leg"", she has a leg she cannot put any weight on at all (looks like a foot injury). She should either be using two crutches in place of her injured foot or one crutch to supplement a leg she can't put full weight on. This case seems like the former."
Dude a car once honked at me and my great grandma while we were crossing the street. She walks really slow, and we got caught in the middle when their light turned green,I flipped him off and I waited in front of him until she crossed and then I crossed. Dick drivers out there.
Especially just letting a stranger give you a piggyback ride and put their hands on your ass... no way this is real
Nice... Hopping.
This subreddit is only 3 posts and the context of each is radically different
yeah that would suck
It looks like an r/science thread.
I feel a wheelchair might be better given that that crosswalk is hundreds of miles wide.
Yeah, seems staged.  The girl got ready to hop on her back before the other woman even bent down.  Also, whoever is filming is not in a car and doesn't seem like a cell phone recording.
Years ago my daughter had to have a tooth pulled and I took her to a special pediatric dentist that sedated her to have it done. She was about 6.   On the way home we had to stop and fill a prescription for antibiotics and we stop at Walmart.   She was still a little loopy from the sedation and she was walking very slowly and strangely. She refused to be carried. As we cross the crosswalk, slowly, somebody honked at us. Honked!   A man crossing the other direction literally yelled at the driver can‚Äôt you see she has a disabled child!   It made me so sad to think that somebody with a disabled child who was walking slow and maybe a little weird would be honked at by a stranger. On a crosswalk.
With like no hesitation or downtime either. Just immediately piggyback, go.
I‚Äôm glad that man stood up for you. Some people are just assholes. Once when I was 8 months pregnant I was walking from my car into Target and an old lady just held down her horn as I crossed the driveway in front of the store. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and actually walk really quickly, even while pregnant. It was so bizarre but I hate confrontation so I just hurried into the store and kept an eye out for her as I shopped.
"Jeez, that's crazy. I'd be terrified to cross one of those!  Just a heads up, I'm referencing the moving ""Young Frankenstein"". I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it!"
something about being in a car just flips an asshole switch in some people's brains, I don't understand it
The ultimate kindness. One of my coworkers ended up discovering a student who was self harming through Yik Yak and was able to convince the student to see counseling appointments. People are great when someone is in need.

I found out my brothers account a while ago. He just told absurd lies about how he was treated by our family so that Reddit would throw him a pity party.   Like straight up accused our parents of being unable to feed him and refusing to buy him basic necessities while they were paying for him to go away to a 4 year state school
r/humansbeingbrosinlaw
I did something similar with my brother. I found his tumblr and saw all this depressing stuff and eventually figured out that he was also self harming.   I would send him anon asks asking about his day and telling him jokes until he eventually found that I knew his tumblr.   One of the first jokes I sent to him, he repeated back to my sister and I and he couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. It was the first time in a while that I had seen him laugh like that.   I wish I could have sent him more anon messages. 
Nah I wanna know why that brosis hates that spaghetti, real talk.
PSA: if you need help but are worried people are too busy, just know that your family/friends/significant other etc all adore you, and you are never a burden. Ever. You are loved.
To do something anonymously that you'll never get recognition for to help someone else is probably the most honorable thing a person can do.
here, have a broke mans gold on me ü•á  Edit: Thank you so much for my first ever real gold!
Even if they now know, it should be fine I guess
How old is your brother? Also, Im just curious, did you do anything with it? Like, told your parents or told him you know it?
How'd he react when he found out?
"^THIS I dont remember who said it but there is a quote along the lines ""morality is doing what is right or wrong regardless of consequence or reward"" There is also a similar nugget buried in the abrahamic religions where they say something similar to ""true charity is done in secret"""
I want a broke mans platinum [MINIMUM](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/anrtt4/encountered_one_on_reddit_i_received_platinum_a/) now
Sounds like he's not worth the trouble
He was pissed but I don‚Äôt think he ever made the connection that I was the anon sending him messages. Eventually he changed his url and because I wasn‚Äôt following it, i couldn‚Äôt find his new one. 
"I had a teacher in high school that would always say ""Do the right thing because it's the right thing to do."" I always thought it was lame he always said it, until I found myself going through life and repeating that mantra pretty much any time I was faced with a decision to take an unethical short cut.   I mean, it's not like I ever followed the advise, but he sure got it stuck in my head."
Yeah they should stop feeding him
My dad raised me to believe in two main ideas: do the right thing, and do things right. They're incredibly powerful beliefs that I carry with me to this day.
Maybe she should visit that dinner again on a  Friday and ask around. I'm sure someone there knows him. Although I am sure he did it out of the kindness of his heart and not for a thank you. He would be proud of how her life turned out I'm sure.
The biggest thing you can do for people is just treat them the same, no big fuss. Shout out to this man and the woman for accomplishing all she has
Imagine how scared she must've been in the beginning conflicted between hunger and the possibility of the man wanting something in return. Homelessness is something nobody deserves.
It sounds like there would have been a day where he came to visit again and she wasn't there anymore, which makes me sad for him more than anything.
I hope this somehow finds him...
"Isn't this what ""Pay It Forward"" (the principle, not the movie) is all about? Someone did something for you that was simple for them but amazing for you. Now it's your turn to do the same for someone else who is in need. Pretty sure it would be greater than finding and thanking the original person.  P.S. if this is from Reddit, why screenshot and not share the original post?"
"There was a one-legged homeless man who lived in a recessed window across the street from where I had my first job. His name was Charlie and he would yell curses at anyone who tried to talk to him or give him money. One day I got some pizza slices and noticed him sitting across the street on the curb so I went over like I belonged there and just say down about a foot from him and said ""this pizza is really good but the slices are so big, would you like the extra slice?"" And then I set it between us like it was a thing decided. He started munching and told me how he hadn't had pizza in years and it was as good as he remembered it. Every day after that until he died I would go out and share whatever lunch I brought with him. Idk if I made a difference in his life or not but he accepted me and I think I made him feel human. Here's to you Charlie!"
Definitely it is the little thing that counts and he sounds like a good man, I'm sure he would be happy to see her again.
The quote under this post was the real winner. You might not be able to pay it back, but you can always pay it forward.
Great idea... Goddamn, this post made me tear up. I've been hungry before, luckily, never on the streets but I've known what it is to not have money for food.   God bless the good people.
True true. But the fact that he has no idea what he caused... my heart hurts.
They were in a public place. He wasn't even paying attention to her but reading the paper. That is one of the great things about the story never a hint of a threat at any time.
"I like to think that he knew. He went to the corner, same as always and waited for just as long as every other time before. When time passed and she was nowhere to be found: he knew. He smiled at the diner, took one last look at the streets, whispered ""goodbye"" and went on with his day. His work was finished, but her's had just begun."
he knows  probably because someone did it for him
That's exactly it. I feel like when you do something for someone like that it's the long con. You can't do much to help them, but maybe a different way of thinking or a different attitude than what they're current environment offers them. Just a simple gesture could get the gears in their brain turning, and I'm happy it worked out in this scenario.
I love it. Thank you for sharing that.
He walks around knowing he regularly fed a homeless kid. When you do stuff like that it stays with you, keeps you warm at night. Don‚Äôt let your heart hurt too much.
Never a hint of threat? How can you assume that? If she‚Äôs been accosted by men before, for accepting ‚Äúhelp‚Äù from them, the mere fact that this guy approached her at all was ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù in her eyes, or had the potential to be. You never know when that ‚Äúkind man‚Äù could turn on you and say you owe him.   He didn‚Äôt do that, according to the story, but just because you‚Äôre in a public place doesn‚Äôt erase any and all danger wtf  Edit: should have said ‚Äúcould have been threatening in her eyes‚Äù and not ‚Äúwas threatening.‚Äù   There. Happy?   Point was, as per the comment I was replying to, the overall assumption that a homeless woman was somehow magically extra super safe and not AT ALL still at risk, merely because she was in a public place was kind of incredulous to me. That‚Äôs it. I didn‚Äôt say shit about *all men* anything, so calm down.   Everyone‚Äôs assuming a whole lot about a screen shot of a secondhand story, anyway lol
"Hence me saying the ""possibility"". Homeless people get robbed, jumped, and harassed on the regular. It is reasonable to assume someone you never knew or met might have some ulterior motives. Thank God he was just a decent sweet man who saw someone struggling and decided to do something about it and lend a hand.   I'm not attributing any ill will to the man. It's just that life is unfair and hard out there on the streets."
Inspirational music starts and credits fade in
Today you, tomorrow me.

">Never a hint of threat? How can you assume that?  Because the post *literally* says ""she never felt any danger with him""  That's how some crazy people are assuming she never felt threatened. Crazy, right?  Crazy.  Edit: and yes, the person you're blasting very clearly stated that the great thing about *this story* was that there wasn't a hint of threat at any time. It sounds like they were pretty clear that it wasn't to be taken as referring to all stories."
I work in a clinic that serves people experiencing homelessness. I tell all of my staff, when they come to work for us:  You‚Äôre here for a reason. You‚Äôre trying to make the world a better place. It took 30 years for things to get as bad as they are right now. So, I want you to understand that it might take 30 years to get us to the place where everyone has a home, and what they need to live a fulfilling life.   If you want to make this world better, that means playing a long game.   I want you to do what it takes to care for yourself to fully show up, every day, for this game. That means that you eat, sleep, move, and declutter. Every week.  Every time we sit down together, I‚Äôm going to ask you what you are doing to take care of yourself. You get to say ‚ÄúNetflix and frozen pizza‚Äù for three weeks in a row. But if that‚Äôs still your answer on week four, we are going to have a serious conversation.  Keep showing up. The small ways that you make this problem better, every day, add up.

Yup. Ignored an AOL email for 5 years (the one I‚Äôd had since 4th grade) and came back to a ‚Äúwelcome to AOL!‚Äù intro and absolutely no emails or info saved at all. Might as well have opened a new account.
I just PANICKED reading this. I email them all the time but never sign in. They‚Äôre all there though :)  Would it help prevent deletion if you added the email as an account on a mobile or tablet? 
Right? Or on an external hard drive or something. Emails delete themselves after a certain amount of time anyway.
At least with scrapbooks you can flip through the pages quickly, with an email you‚Äôd spend a lot of time scrolling

Saint Francis, the Patron Saint of Animals is my favorite.   On his Feast Day in early October they hold public Pet Blessings. There are cool photos and videos online of people bringing dogs, cats, horses, reptiles, llamas, you name it to receive a blessing.
Is this in Brazil? the dog looks brazilian
Dogs are God's creatures. He is doing God's work. What a good man.
Our religious leaders just told us animals don't have souls so crying over one is stupid. Am atheist now.
Our Catholic Church did this today. One of mine hid under a park bench (all hundred pounds of her) and the other one licked the aspergillum. I‚Äôm not sure either one of them netted a blessing.   It was a lot of fun, though. They made cheeseburgers for the people and hamburgers for the dogs afterward.

Can confirm. Went to see him with my dad in '98. We were settling into our nosebleed seats when an attendant asked us if we wanted to move closer, said he had two seats up front. When my dad inquired what it would cost the attendant laughed and said follow me, this is just something Billy likes to do for his fans. Gave us VIP front row seats! One of my best memories with my dad.
This has been the case for decades. My sisters were selected for the front row way back in the 90‚Äôs. Maybe during one of his dueling piano shows with Elton John.  Also, it isn‚Äôt just attractive women up there, as my sisters are both hideous individuals.
Can confirm. My sister got one of these seats last year.
We went to his concert and he mentioned it. He also mentioned that it means he sees a row of hot women since most of the people who work for him are men and they give the tickets to ladies. 
At the Billy Joel/Elton John concert in Wichita, KS few years ago they both did this.  Except... Billy's side was full of young 20s women, and Eltons side was full of young 20s men. And Billy pointed it out during the show.  And it definitely wasn't based on where their original seat was located cause they were finding them in the hallways, not where they were sitting.  Edit: My crappy typing
Coldplay does it too, for their biggest fans. I went with my dad to their concert and made pins that said ‚Äúfather daughter Coldplay concert‚Äù modeled after one of their album motifs and we got bumped up to front row from a roadie. The ticket scanning people weren‚Äôt even sure what to make of it, and thought we had been tricked until they worked. We gave him our old tickets in the back rows and he bumped us up, and told us our old tickets would go to charity (kids in the hospital or something, don‚Äôt remember clearly because of all the excitement).   Coldplay is my father and mines favorite band, so it was really the most amazing experience ever. I cried just about the whole time. Even ended up on the big screen. Can‚Äôt wait to go to another concert.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone do something similar for their The Book of Mormon show. Front row is given away through free lottery before each show. They mentioned it was because they remembered when they were young and broke and couldn't afford to go to shows, this was their way of making it possible for young broke fans!  I was fortunate enough to win two front rows in London, best show ever. 
I can‚Äôt speak for Billy Joel, but almost the same thing happened to me and my husband at a Blake Shelton concert.  We literally couldn‚Äôt have had worse seats and someone came along and moved our entire row to a section on the floor that was empty.  It wasn‚Äôt front row but it was a huge improvement over where we were at.  I always suspected something was up because why would a whole floor section have been kept empty. 
Paul McCartney does this too! When I went to see him with my ex we were chosen by a scout to sit in the very front row. Best night ever. 
I‚Äôve been front row for him and Elton john and it was Not free.  
TIL rich people can't be real fans .
Aw man, that‚Äôs really sweet. I love that for you.
"I read ""'98"" and had to check the username to make sure that the fucking undertaker wasn't gonna come out lol "
Holy shit, that‚Äôs wholesome. Glad you got to share that memory with your dad!
What's nosebleed seats? ü§î  Edit: Thank you, helpful redditors. üòª
Spoken like a true big brother.
"""we'll choose that girl because she's hot, oh, and those two because they  look like they could use a break."" "
Lmao the last sentence really made me smile
Is she a heinous individual? 
Apparently everybody's sister here has seen Billy Joel
"xD that's so awkward, like, i can imagine some young men who just liked Elton John's music, didn't think about his sexual preferences, and suddenly found themselves wondering if ""they were getting gayed on"" by some dude in his 60s ..."
"Came to say this. Some friends of mine saw them in Toronto maybe ten years ago. Said they were hanging out outside the venue and some rando with like an official looking badge on a lanyard walked up and asked if they were there to see the show. When they confirmed he grilled them a bit. ""Are you _real_ fans though?"". ""Can you sing the first two lines of Clocks for me?""  After they provided their bona fides as proper fans he took their tickets in the nosebleeds and replaced them with front row seats. "
I knew a girl in college who ran into Chris Martin on the street before a show. She was a huge fan and asked for a picture. He obliged and asked her how much she paid for her tickets. He then went to an atm and paid her back!
IIRC most Broadway shows have a lottery of some kind. Hamilton does Ham4Ham, where you get front row seats for $10 (a Hamilton)
On a scale of 1-10 how attractive are  you? :)
The only problem with that is you have to sit through a Kid Rock concert. 
I love you for that. 
You know it's been a while since I've seen that guy 
Seats so high up that your nose bleeds üòâ
It‚Äôll be especially true if it turns out his sisters are gorgeous
It‚Äôs a requirement I heard

(Mom in plain view of what‚Äôs happening)  I thought I told you to take out the trash
"Couldn't help but think of this classic:  ""His eyes moved to the red ribbon she had planted on his right pectoral muscle. He saw something in her eyes when she touched him. A recognition of firmness. After all, he was toned to perfection from weeks of rebuilding a church in Rokoray, along the northern banks of the Great Scarcies River. He had met a woman there who reminded him of his sister. He cared for her, taught her a fledgling example of English, had even found himself feeling love for her. That was not a sisterly love however. Then again‚Ä¶ was this?  He began to open his mouth. Any moment his parents would walk downstairs. The look on her face said they were on the same channel. Everything he had just thought, she heard it. He spoke.  ‚ÄúListen, when mom and dad go out to say hi to the Gelsons next door tonight, let‚Äôs hang back, go upstairs and fuck the shit out of each other.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She answered, bewildered.  ‚ÄúC‚Äômon let's do it. Let‚Äôs fuck. Haven‚Äôt we always wanted this?‚Äù He reached out to reassure her, but she pulled away, fear in her eyes. ‚ÄúWhoa whoa. Uh no I‚Äôm just happy you‚Äôre home from Africa. What the hell are you talking about wanting to fuck me? Are you seriou--‚Äù And like a blade being hammered on the anvil, his father‚Äôs voice rang out from behind him: ‚ÄúWHAT IN SAM HILL IS GOING ON HERE?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI can explain‚Ä¶‚Äù he stammered, but was cut off by the visceral scream from his mother as she began sobbing into her bathrobe. His father erupted, white morning spittle shooting from the corners of his mouth.  ‚ÄúNO SON OF MINE IS GONNA DRINK FUCKING FOLGERS COFFEE!‚Äù He belted his son in the face, knocking the boy unconscious. ‚ÄúTHIS IS A PEETS COFFEE HOUSE!‚Äù  Drink Peets Coffee.Ôªø"" -BMS https://youtu.be/Hv0gXgTPveg?t=2m37s"

I really hope I accept death with as much grace as this when the time comes. Jeez.
*Clinks bottle* Sk√•l (cheers)
This is how all of our parents should go out. one last happy memory that leaves the family without mourning, but instead joy and a sense of feeling complete.
Would have been a great upbringing. Three sons, football and beer. I'd die smiling too.
He raised those boys right. Check out that Packer fan! Cheers to your grandpa!
I love this
One last beer and those sons of bitches bring him a nasty ass Bud Light.
Pictures like this always make me feel so, I don‚Äôt know, vulnerable I guess. It‚Äôs so bittersweet and makes a pit form in my chest. Death is such a weird part of life. Leaving people behind, or being the one to carry on like his wife (I‚Äôm assuming, could be a sister).  Hope his family and himself take care.
at the end of the day folks, this is all that matters. evolutionary, socially, and emotionally.   work to be happy and create a couple happy people(a family) and you've made a world a better place and done a heroic deed.   this moment is universally touching.   also what a beautiful wife.
This is what I want to learn from life more than anything else. I wish more culture was dedicated to learning to accept death.

My dad passed earlier this year, and me and my siblings were able to take one last shot of whisky with him. He passed a few hours later.
Her husband hasn't even passed away for a day and you are already trying to jump on her. Give her some time!
Why? I understand the desire to be better at accepting and handling death.  But why is it the thing you want to learn most from life?  I‚Äôm not trying to be rude by the way, I‚Äôm just curious because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve come across a lot of people whose goal in life it is to learn how to die gracefully.
What a beautiful comment.
Man, for me, it's because that's truly one of the only things we all have in common. We all are birthed and we will all die.  A lot of cultures have answers for what happens after death, but few actually prepare people for the act of dying. The fucked up part is that most of the time, we don't know when it will happen, but it's only a matter of time. The more time we spend here, the greater the chance we get hit by a bus, meteor, or by some coincidental lightening bolt after making a sacrilegious remark.  I fear the moment of death because of the unknown. Will it be painful or euphoric? I have no idea and that's the scary part. I want to think I'll go with grace and have left a legacy of decentness behind me.   The one thing I do know is that pain is temporary and I don't remember things before I was born. I anticipate the same for death and that's somehow comforting. I've helped a lot of dead people from my old profession and, to be honest, I've never heard a dead person complain.
Such a smart way to allow positive physical contact. Everything is so strict these days, teachers can't hug their students, so letting them initiate and giving them options is a great way to allow those kids to get a little extra love if they need it! 
Sometime you need a hug, sometimes you need a high five
We had a teacher like this in 3rd grade. 5 students including me accidentally called her mom.
The last kid tho..he has got the moves like jagger
But what does the 7 do??
I wish every teacher made you feel this excited to enter the classroom, how welcoming and approachable and fun! I love this! 
The teacher is one of the biggest factors in an education, you will do better work if you have a good teacher
My son‚Äôs kindergarten teacher was exceptional, like her. Once during morning drop off she was greeting the children and a little girl pulled out a baby doll from her backpack to show her. Rather than a passing ‚Äúthat‚Äôs nice‚Äù the teacher stopped what she was doing to fuss over the doll. She asked if she could hold it and snuggled the doll like it was a real baby, told the little girl how cute and darling the doll was. She spent over a minute with the little girl and her doll. That little girl felt so, so special and important and validated. Now when children show me something of theirs I make a point truly to listen and acknowledge how special the object/whatever is. 
This is called Brain Heart Guidance (Concious Discipline) classroom management. It is an awesome program that works. It completely turned around Orange County FL. She is doing a welcome/ I Love You ritual here where kids choose their level of contact with the teacher.    If you're interested in adapting it to home life, there are books and online resources. I used it in my classroom for 5 years when I taught younger students. A hug can go a really long way. 
*shuts the classroom doors* NOW LISTEN YOU LIL FUCKERS...
I need this chart at work for morning greetings. 
I love everything about this.    I bet you anything this puts the teacher in the best possible mood, too.  Which as a parent I assure you makes a huge difference in dealing with these monsters.
This was absolutely adorable. ‚ô•Ô∏è
My students always got a choice of a handshake a hug or a high five at the door in the morning. I always said good morning to each one and expected them to say good morning back. It‚Äôs important for kids to be seen and loved first thing in their school day. Also let‚Äôs the teacher know where everyone is emotionally as they get started.
This is the cutest! Makes me want to be a teacher!
Super sweet. I love that these kids are getting to learn about respecting personal boundaries and that they're not being forced to have physical contact if they don't want it while still being friendly. I was always forced to hug people as a child even when I *hated* it because being polite was apparently more important than having control over who gets to touch my body and I still feel uncomfortable hugging people now :(  Also, that last kid's wiggles were hilarious. So cute.
She be energizin' your goddamn day.
I can imagine how much this would mean to a kid who isn't getting this affection or warmth at home. This teacher is a rock star. 
Yes yes yes!   This teaches the importance of respecting boundaries, of communicating wants/needs, and instills the practicality of enthusiastically greeting people.   I love everything about this.
Dude, I'm 27 and I feel like we all still need this shit in our lives. 
I‚Äôve been having a really hard time getting my work done for my English class and stuff because of various family issues just stressing me out and not having enough time to do them. I told my English teacher this and she gave me a hug and said that‚Äôs it‚Äôs alright and she understands. Almost made me tear up. 
After I was done with middle school (So I was 16 years of age) I hugged each and every one of my teachers. They had been an absolute blessing when they were helping me through the school, as I wasn‚Äôt really academically skilled. This year I‚Äôm going into an apprenticeship in one of the top tier universities for technology in Europe, and it would not be for those teachers that taught me how to actually contract all the knowledge around me. Back in middle school I didn‚Äôt care and I never paid attention. That was until I was taught better. 
Twenty years ago my son's kindergarten teacher gave them a choice of handshake, high five or a hug.    Mrs. S was the best. 
I mentor a middle school girl through a wonderful charity, and reading the handbook made me sad.   No front hugs, it has to be side hugs lasting less than 3 seconds. Kids over 6 cannot sit on your lap when you are reading to them. No brushing their hair. No facing the children unless you are at least 12‚Äù away, and so forth.   It made me so sad that the world has come to this. But I try to bring as much light as possible, and hope to overshine the darkness. 
Sometimes you need a dance party
I know it's embarrassing for the kid when they call a teacher mom, I had a few I said that to as well. But now that im older I realized if you're comfortable enough with your teacher that you mistake them for your own mother in that split second, well that's just wholesome. The teachers that I called mom were the nicest, sweetest  teachers I had ever had.
I'm a third grade teacher and I've gotten called dad on multiple times!   I pretend to not hear it or else they'll get embarrassed. 
My daughter playfully slapped the teacher‚Äôs butt in kindergarten. When she told me about it at conferences I was mortified. Teacher just laughed it off, and said ‚Äúsome kids are huggers, yours is a butt spanker!‚Äù 20 years later I still like to tease her! And she‚Äôs good friends with the teacher‚Äôs daughter-in-law so I hope she brings it up!
He kept her in suspense on purpose. 
I enjoyed that moment of impossibility of choice where he just stood there like HUG???? HIGH FIVE??? DANCE??? omg what do I dooooo 
7 minutes in heaven. 
It's an elbow; you bump elbows
The 7 is actually the stylized profile view of a bowing combatant.   If a child chooses 7, she and the teacher fight to the death. If the child wins, she becomes the new teacher.    
I think it's an arm/elbow.  [I'm betting it's an elbow bump.](https://media.guestofaguest.com/t_article_content/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/steve-martin.jpg)
"I started working with teachers recently, tbh you might not know but they have so much pressure on them, so many rules and things they gotta follow. One teacher has like 20+ students in a single class all day long. And she has to solo teach it.  Now idk about you, but being in a class full of 8yo kids isn't as fun as that video, specially if the kids come from rough neighborhood with missing parents or so.   I usually try to talk to them when they get angry and start breaking stuff. They usually break down and start telling me their issues, ""my mom doesn't allow me to play after school"", ""they took away my console"", and other reasons.   But again we can't do much other than calming them down and move on to the next kid. "
Yeah it's a shame so many countries overwork their teachers while paying them so little. I know a few people who got into teaching and had the same positivity and enthusiasm at the start but it rapidly dwindled over the years. 
"Man that would be great. What four options?  ""Happy (day of the week!)""  ""Good morning!""  ""*Impartial nod*""  ""*Neutral comment about the weather*"""
Then you see the paycheck...  *cries in ramen noodles*
I'll bet she would create a special option for that, though. 
"I am a male elementary school librarian, so I don't have to imagine. Outcome would be the same. Reddit has this obsession with men being persecuted in education, but the reality is that both men and women need to use common sense and remember that ""perception is reality"" when working with kids. None of the teachers I work with (male or female) would initiate contact with a kid, but none of them (male or female) that I know would turn down a hug, either. "
Male version would be probably more like this, which is pretty fantastic.  https://www.nbcnews.com/video/teacher-s-twist-on-a-high-five-has-students-smiling-867194947871?v=railb&  As a man, I just wouldn't let a hug be an option. Sadly that's the case. Though I can see why it's the case.
I just had a group class in therapy about the negative impacts of childhood that carry in to adult life. There was a questionnaire, and if you scored at or higher than a 4 (out of 10), your likelihood of maladaptive behaviour as an adult skyrocketed, as well as health issues like COPD and autoimmune related conditions.  We then learned that if we had at least one positive and caring adult influence in our lives (as well as other outside influences), our resiliency score went up, meaning our ability to tolerate certain things easier, and possessing the ability to ask for help if we are in crisis.   This teacher, whether she knows it or not, is a hero, and will be the force in some of these children's lives that determine whether or not they are able to trust others, seek help, and cope as adults. This is what real power looks like.  EDIT: It's called the ACES questionnaire. I posted it as well as the resilience test for anyone interested here:   http://imgur.com/a/wVS1Rpc  The link can be found on the bottom page but I'm sure it's easily found in google. Good luck, I hope this helps a few people!
We do. People seriously underestimate the power of positive physical affection. Whether from family, friend or SO. Sometimes we all just need a damn hug. I can't remember the last time I was hugged. 
To be fair, I see why Catholic schools might be a bit paranoid.
And sometimes, you need a 7.
"i still remember that one day i accidentally called my teacher ""mom"" , but now that you guys mention it, she probably felt great. this makes me feel great :D"
I accidentally called my 9th grade biology teacher mom. He was amused, but oh does it haunt me.
Aww, I‚Äôm a teacher and get called mom occasionally. Once I got called grandpa! 
"I'm a preschool teacher so it's not as embarrassing for my kids when they slip. I always respond,  ""Yes, my sweet child?""  and it always gets me laughs from all the kids including the ones that called me mom. "
"I just answer anyway as smoothly as possible and they never even notice they did it. I'm 6'5"" 230lbs dude, get called Mom by kinders all day!"
her face at the end even goes like 'damn this kid lowkey got moves'
So inappropriate. Thanks for the laugh

Or an elbow to the temple
That is a photo of three people you wouldn't expect to see together...
I know someone who just started teaching 1st grade in a rougher school area.  The stories she has can be heartbreaking.  Some of these kids are already so handicapped by their home life.  Neglectful parents, parents who will start fights at school meets, horrid sleep schedules, little to no structure.  I wonder if these kids will rise above their circumstances and make something from nothing.  Its a shame that things can be so stacked against a 6 year old.  A good teacher might be the only positive thing in their lives.  
You forgot about the sweet dance moves they're learning as well
"I had a friend who sadly was in a serious accident and due to brain damage was never the same but before the accident would always say ""WE HUG IN THIS FAMILY"" and make sure that upon greeting and departing from friends he would get a hug. Now my entire friend group does this and Its really nice. "
*internet hugs*, bro
I was really hoping that somebody would go for the 7 just so I could know what it means.
And after dealing with kids all day, you need a 7 & 7.
I did this too, he wasn't very enthusiastic 
*He*
My son called me by his preschool teacher's name once, just to switch it up! 
Explains why none of them picked it 
Yes!! The sweet dance moves help with things like body awareness! 
That last kid surprised me.
I think it‚Äôs an elbow bump. The 7 picture looks like it could be an elbow. Just my guess.
It‚Äôs an elbow, they would bump elbows

I didn't give it to him but my dad had one too. Inside some grease proof paper always kept in his wallet ... Brought back memories! 
When my kids were little (in their 30's now) they each gave me coupons for my birthday...make me a sandwich, give me a hug, etc. I still have those coupons and intend to collect when I'm a bit older and really need them.
That is so sweet! And what a great keepsake to remind you of how much your dad loved you. Hold on tight to that one! 
My sister found me a four leaf clover when we were teenagers and I saved it in a piece of tape just like this and I still have it, I keep it with me in my car! This made me smile :)

I saved money when I was 13 and bought my dad a Zippo lighter with his initials engraved on it, I thought it was the best gift ever because Zippos seemed like the coolest thing ever when I was 13 and my dad smokes. He still hasn‚Äôt used it till this day and it‚Äôs just thrown in some drawer somewhere, and I really hate that. 
Should‚Äôve given him the red one in 94, he‚Äôd be running the joint
This made me really sad, my dad died last week and I don't think I did anything like that for him. I've never been good at talking to my family, and I always thought there'd be more time

Saddest episode by far. Jurassic Bark has nothing on it
I'm sorry. Those coupons are expired 
A friend from high school once gave me a folded piece of paper which read TICKET MAN in bold letters, and told me that I was now the ticket man.  15 years on, I'm still the [Ticket MAN!](https://i.imgur.com/TPJz2eV.jpg)
20 years it's pretty lucky in my book
I'm sorry for your loss. It always feels like that, doesn't it? Like there's always going to be more time.   But, you know what? I think he knew. It's not always the gestures or gifts that make a difference; it's the little things that we remember. You loved him, and I believe he knew it. 
Dooooooon‚Äôt yoooooouuuu forget about me.

Its funny but most people simply dont realize what skateboarding actually is. Ive been at it for 30 plus years  and it is still complex , beautiful,  and misunderstood. She was right to be hyped because that was literally art in motion. 
That trick looks ridiculously difficult 
Man. I wish I could be that excited over anything. Let alone some trick I happened upon on my way to work or whatever.
I love people who can be this happy for simple things. Thanks kind lady for sharing your wholesome smile. 
I love how he gave her a hug at the end.
How fucking cute is this
Are those grind guards broken off?
I love that he goes back to give her a hug, too. Good vibes all the way around. 
Idk, she acts drunk.  Sources:  1.: Am frequently drunk :)  2.: Mum was frequently drunk :(
I was hoping he'd bust out another trick for her!
I went back to watch the hug.
Kickflip into a backside tail slide? Surprised she didn't drop her pants too.

Your speed doesn‚Äôt matter. Forward is forward, buddy. Be proud of your accomplishments/improvements, no matter how ‚Äúsmall‚Äù they seem. :)
It's fucking hard. Damm I wish I had more time to skate
It is, that was fucking sick and I'd be just as hype if I saw this go down in person
Maybe she understands skateboarding. This is a trick I've never seen live in 10 years of skateboarding. Pro level.
That's a kickflip back tail down a thin hubba, in no way shape or form a simple thing. Dude could get buck really easily.
That little exchange made both their days, I bet.
Thanks for writing this comment. I hadn't watch the clip till the end.   This part really adds to it.
You never could pull off sick tricks like this though

I know you didn't say it to me but I needed it all the same. thank you good human!
Great words! I‚Äôm older now and take great satisfaction in watching my teenage son and his friends, do the crazy fearless things I used to be able too. Although as a dad it still scares the hell out of me to watch.
I couldn't even do that trick in Skate 3

‚ÄúIt is worth observing this warm example of a mature female *Homo sapiens*, her own carefully nurtured progeny having left her nest in robust health after providing their careful and labor-intensive upbringing, continuing her life mission via the support of other female *Homo sapiens‚Äô* young.

Fanboying the fangirl, I love it. So cute haha
I love the little excited bouncing on his toes that he does. 
That's awesome. What book is it? 
I can only imagine how good that must have felt to him, knowing someone loved his creation so much they wanted to spend time and money to emulate it. This made me wanna cry happy tears  *Edited for grammar so people can stop pointing it out
LITTLE JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
Man that guy on the right should be a model or something. 
Man, that's living the dream. I don't know how I'd react to something like. Probably just sit and cry for an hour.
He fangirled his own fangirl. This is adorable.

"It's really weird to see Jeremy described simply as ""author."""
Holy shit I didn't expect to see Achievement Hunter in this sub 
God I love Rooster Teeth. The whole team is a buncha gems 
That‚Äôs so cool. I bet that‚Äôs a far cooler feeling  than receiving money for it. 
I love how excited he was and still went for the gentlest hug. Did you see his forearms? Dude could've ended her!
An unconventional r/tippytaps ?
Is that Ryan from Rooster Teeth on the right?
268 comments and no one pointed out who the cosplayer is. According to [Jeremy's twitter](https://twitter.com/JeremyNDooley/status/1025467947790331905?s=09) she's cosplayer @ColumbiaSkies
As a huge fan of Rooster Teeth, it‚Äôs so cool (and strange) seeing them referred to on other subs! I love this interaction so so much 
Jeremy wrote a book?
JEREMY YAAYYY
The book is Go Nitro: Rise of The Blades  Its a pretty good sci-fi superhero story about 5 people being turned into super hero's to fight against a super powered gang that's assaulting the city
The way he picked her up was so cute. Such a wholesome moment. 
Photo of them both. https://mobile.twitter.com/JeremyNDooley/status/1025467947790331905
We need to understand He just saw his character in the flesh for the first time. Something that‚Äôs been in his head for years is now right in front of him 
/r/tippytaps
And I love the fact that she start bouncing too right after
His name's Jeremy Dooley (he works at Rooster Teeth) and the book is called Go Nitro. It's a sci-fi supehero story that he came up with in 4th grade but only recently released, so I think this encounter kind of blew his mind.  **Edit**: I should mention that the cosplayer responsible for this wonderfulness is @ColumbiaSkies   [twitter sauce here](https://twitter.com/lilmj_/status/1025498513050886145)
The writer is Jeremy Dooley from Achievement Hunter/Rooster Teeth. I believe the book is Go Nitro: Rise of the Blades
Writer here, working on my first real novel. I can guarantee, without a doubt, that if I ever see someone cosplay one of my characters, I'll break down crying on the spot, and I'm not usually an emotional guy. One of the biggest compliment anyone can give a writer, in my opinion, is to be inspired by said writer's work. Someone once drew fanart of a fanfic I wrote, and it was by far my proudest moment as a writer. 
Here's lookin at you kid!
Not so little J, as it turns out. 
Came here for the same thing. Love when Monster Truck pops up outside of r/roosterteeth.
Maybe a serial killer too
Ryan Haywood is his name
preferably as a gnome
I can just picture him as a sexy gnome
This has gotta be Jeremy‚Äôs high light of the entire event. There‚Äôs no way he didn‚Äôt shed a manly tear backstage lol
He looked like he was going to cry right before he put her down, so sweet
Ultimate fangirl cred

It threw me off. I was like ‚ÄúWait, why does that guy look so familiar?‚Äù Took me looking at the RTX backdrop to figure it out .

For the most part. [INSERT NAME HERE] just should go away. They really suck.  (It's a joke.)
Just imagine the nagging doubt in the back of any creators mind wondering if people truly like your work.   Then you see that somebody took the time to work so hard on the cosplay. I can only imagine what that is like. 
Emperor Calus Bod.
His arms? Dude got legs for days! I mean he axe kicked a table in half once
Yea, and Jeremy on the left 
Sorry I should've done that. I'll edit it into the comment I have at the top of the thread :)
This is why I like being 5 foot 1.  He was more excited than her, it was indeed cute.  I wanna see the outfit from the front.
That is the cutest goddamn tweet, oh my god. Look how chuffed and giddy with happiness that huge smile of his is!

I almost always envision a character from a book wrong, usually because I missed a part where they're depicting what the character looks like
I‚Äôm so out of the RT / AH loop. I was looking at the gif and saw the RTX logo and kept thinking, that looks like Jeremy but ‚Äúwriter?!‚Äù  Awesome!
Now what kind of fanfic? If it‚Äôs anything other than Waluigi x Roblox I will be disappointed.
If you say here‚Äôs looking at you one more time...
Well hung short man that loves to rap? www.BigDLilJ.com.
Well he already has the skills to keep poor cows captive.
Woosh 
I am pretty sure his name is GiveMeYourMilk
That's Lord Explosion Murder to you!
Well yeah, but I bet they get government grants to keep Jon on the spot.
Especially because he was already fairly well known before writing the book because he is one of the main people at achievement hunter. He has talked about this before, how he was convinced people bought the book just because they knew him and not that they were actually interested in the story.
They both are Ryan from Rooster Teeth?
I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô11 woman and the first time someone picked me up and spun me around I almost died from excitement. Then I married him.
[Here ](https://twitter.com/JeremyNDooley/status/1025467947790331905?s=20) he took a photo with her and posted it on Twitter. 
This is real, I can rest now
/r/haptappaps
He recognized her right away, but it would be interesting as a writer to see how readers perceive your characters. As the author you have this idea of what she looks like, but the perspective is different for every person that reads it. Still very cool to see your ideas come to life like this. 
Wait, others exist?

Diana Gabaldon, author of the Outlander series has been pretty chuffed [fancy British speak for 'best pleased', stoked, absolutely ecstatic!] with the actors and all the characterisation, costuming etc in the TV show.

You‚Äôre actually not wrong. We got married after our first date. Half a decade and a kid later, I still think we made the right choice.
One of my army buddies once picked me up and spun me around, does that mean we have to get married now?  In that case I have an awkward call to make, I wonder how he'll tell his wife...

you're married
For the lazy:   chuffed  adjective; BRITISH informal Definition: very pleased. 
Look up the reveal from one of the old 7 days to die let‚Äôs plays, it‚Äôs gold!
Very true.   For clarification, the marriage happened 43 hours after the first date. We would have done it on first date day, (First D-Day?,) but the County Registrar was closed.
I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years, and she's starting to ask about marriage. This is a nice way of saying please delete your comment. 
Wait why? I need more context! I want this story! Please tell this story!!!
If she truly wants to marry **you** she will wait, (but don‚Äôt make her wait forever,) if she just wants to *be married* she‚Äôll demand it.
I‚Äôm not sure, still to this day; but as I said above, half a decade and a kid later, we‚Äôre still best friends and think we made a good - although completely insane - choice.  And for the record, yes we did wait years before the baby.
We‚Äôd known each other since we were seven, but hadn‚Äôt seen each other in over 15 years. We found each other on FB, and decided to go watch the Warriors murder the Pelicans. After the game he picked me up and kissed me, and as we were walking back to the light rail, he stopped and asked me to marry him. It was a weekend, so we couldn‚Äôt do it that day, but Monday morning we went and got the marriage license, and a friend of his who is a reverend signed it in his driveway.   BOOM married.
Some things are just universal like the fact that geese are assholes.   Edit: words
As a Mexican I can tell you that the cobra chicken is the only thing we fear more than the chupacabra.
"My brother was driving in a truck w a dude he worked with when a turkey and its babies walked by and the guy said ""aw, look at the turklets""....best name ever."
I am going to write down cobra chicken on my list right under trash panda and danger noodle. 
Polish guy in Work referred to an extension cable as an ‚Äúelectric snake‚Äù. 
He is not wrong. I will walk around buildings on campus to avoid the ‚Äúcobra chickens‚Äù lol 
it's called a Canada goose, not Canadian
"I had a kid in my class that didn't speak alot of English, he was from italy. One day in class during the silence of a testing class, we all heard ""Mr.Tait, can I have a piece of sheet"" Luigi still doesn't know alot of English but we got amazing quotes constantly.  Edit: gonna make this clear. I am not the teacher, but i am a student. For those of you who got to the nicknames part of this thread :P"
My Norwegian cousin was trying to think of the English term for ‚Äúpool noodle‚Äù when he was here visiting the U.S. and he called it a ‚Äúwater sausage‚Äù. 
I grew up in a VERY white part of upstate New York. I took French in high school. I never understood why people always said Hispanics worked in kitchens because, from my experience, it was always white people.   When I moved to CT, I realized I was vastly underprepared for the mostly Spanish speaking kitchen staff. Unable to communicate with the dishwasher that I needed sanitizer, and tired of gesturing like a crazy person with a red bucket in my hand, I looked at him and with the most serious face I could manage, asked for‚Äùleche de chupacabra‚Äù.   He looked at me like i was absolutely crazy, but I just pointed to the bucket, pointed to the sanitizer bucket, and insisted it was called ‚Äúthe goat-sucker‚Äôs milk.‚Äù From then on, that was all it was called, and I was the dishwasher‚Äôs new favorite server. Almost seven years later, and he works at a different location, whenever I see him, I am still ‚Äúmi amor‚Äù. 
All in favor of changing goose to cobra chicken, say I  Edit: just say Aye!
My boyfriend is from Colombia  and told me that the Spanish word for peacock translates to royal turkey. 
The guy tweeted video of the cobra chicken. [Fuck that.](https://twitter.com/bibliophileq/status/1005593354577502208?s=21)
It‚Äôs funny, we have them in Europe too in the summer, they are no trouble here. Swans, however, are real assholes here.
Just asked my dad and he confirms this shit..  
I remember fishing for shad in the CT river with my dad and there was a group of Mexican guys fishing, drinking, and smoking some fatties. Well a beaver swims upstream and they lose their fucking shit, yelling to get out of the water because of the chupacabra.

"I must be the Canada goose whisperer because I've never had a problem and I approach them all the time, even when they have goslings. They are impressive birds. I'll admit I laughed for about 2 minutes at ""cobra chicken"". "

Most of the time copperhead bites don't require antivenom, their bites are extremely painful but rarely do they inject enough that there is a risk of death. Usually they'll just treat the symptoms and give you antibiotics to prevent infection. True for both animals and people.  Study on it here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463771  tl;dr Studied copperhead bite victims over a 15 year period at one medical center, 88 copperhead bite victims, none received antivenom, none required surgery, none died.

Why the salt? I'm just as bored as you on a Sunday redditing from my bed.

Lmao I mean i have no idea but it‚Äôs just funny to picture someone who just got bit by a copperhead trying to act like they haven‚Äôt been bitten by a copperhead while simultaneously trying to convince that same doctor that their perfectly healthy dog is the one who got bit by a copperhead 
It gets karma. Can't blame them for wanting karma. But when I get **death threats** because people can't differentiate the meme from real life, it gets a bit unfunny. 
"""And your dog, you say...was the one who's was bitten?""  ""Yeeesssss...."" He said squealing in pain  ""WOOF!"" üòÉ  ""Riiiiight....that'll be $300 please"""

My mom has systemic lupus and every once in a while when we were kids she'd have to spend a week or so at the hospital. The first time that happened when I was about 10 my dad ordered us kids outside to play while he made dinner. He came out of the house an hour later and announced we were going to Burger King. When we got back home he sent us straight to bed.  Later that night when I was creeping out of bed to get some water I found the kitchen *destroyed.* There was flour everywhere, something unidentifiable burnt in a pan sitting on the stove, the refrigerator door was left open, the sink was loaded with all kinds of bowls and pots, he even managed to get what looked like jelly on the floor with a footprint in it. I snuck past his room on my way back to bed and I heard him crying. That was the night I found out dads could cry.
This didn't make me smile, it made me fucking cry that's what it did  ^(it's so wholesome)
It shows that he's trying to get over the death and try to make everything seem complete again. If he hadn't made the cake, her death would only be more pronounced. Heart breaking.
Never ever stop loving him
r/mademecry
I have SLE. This brought tears to my eyes. It sucks having this disease but it equally sucks for the families that have to deal with it too.
That made me really sad. I feel for your dad. Sounds like he tried his best to take care of you without letting you know how hard it was on him. When she was hospitalised the first time back then, did they know why or was there still a big unknown as to what she had? I know dads can take care of children just as well as moms, but when you're not used to doing it and anxious about your partner, I fully see how it'd be extremely tough to deal with.
Yep, that's it. Pulling the chute on this thread. 8am and I'm already bawling.  Later y'all
My mom was hospitalized two days before my sixth birthday with meningitis. The doctors told my dad & my grandparents that she most likely wasn't going to make it and they needed to prepare to lose her.  Everyone was obviously very focused on her, and not so much on me.  I had no idea how serious it was.  I remember my dad sitting me down and letting me know that we were going to have to skip my birthday this year and have it a little later, because mom was too sick.  I've since learned that he was so desperate that he tried to get himself and I both sick, so that the three of us could die together.  (Also I'm just now realizing that mom must have been about 5 weeks pregnant with my little brother, due to timing.  Holy shit.)  I spent most of that time coloring in the waiting room, and had for the most part gotten over my lack of birthday.  But then, very very late we got back from the hospital one night and my dad opened the front door to the house and presents just spilled out.  So, so many!  I was only 6 but the pile was bigger than me, and it was mindblowing.  Dad said the birthday gnomes must have done it.
Yeah honestly the cake's all over the place but it still looks tasty as hell, which is what really matters. Looks like nice sponge with hella cream, what more can man ask for
"I'm tearing up in my office.  I guess I'm just imagining my dad in this scenario. This soft AF sweet man, who's had his wife cook basically every meal for the last 50 odd years (my mum is still alive).  I can picture the thought beforehand ""Oh no, the birthday cake, Wife used to do that. I guess I'll have to"", I can see him going to the shop to get the ingredients, picking out the recipe and trying to figure it out. All while feeling heartbroken himself that his wife isn't there to do it. And thinking back on the old memories."
My sister did the same thing recently. Our mom passed in February, my birthday is in late March. Last year she had already been sick but still managed to make my favorite cake, Black Forest Gateau. My mom was a huge baker, worked in a cafe and all, but whenever I could chose the cake I‚Äôd go for that one. We gave most of her home baking stuff like her KitchenAid to her best friend who‚Äòs a baker as well because we figured she‚Äôd get more use out of it. And well we have so much of my mom‚Äôs stuff, it was only fitting that she‚Äòd get something too.   On my birthday my sister surprised me with a Black Forest Gateau, using our mom‚Äôs recipe and all. And sure it tasted a bit different, she used a bit too much Kirsch and it was still warm because she miscalculated how long it took, but I know my mom would have come back as a ghost and hit us if we celebrated with store bought cake. And it was delicious. We still have my mom‚Äôs recipe book and I know I‚Äôll be baking some of our favorites along the way, definetly for my sisters birthday in August. Feels like a waste not to do so.
I feel bad for you :-( I know that SLE is almost impossible to be cured and the pain is unbearable but don't lose hope.I hope your SLE would go into remission very soon.
"Thanks, it was difficult for him and us. This was in a different era before the internet and my father was absolutely clueless how to cook or clean and there was nowhere for him to look for answers. Back then men worked and took care of the outside of the house and women ran the household and all things inside. After sending us to school dirty with mismatched outfits and undone hair he gave up and got my grandmother to come by even though she lived far away.   I don't know if my parents knew my mom's diagnosis at that point, they didn't share information like that with us. Again, this was a different era and children were much more innocent then. They were expected to be shielded from the regular pains of life until they had to face them on their own as adults. That was the first time she went to the hospital and I think we were told that she was just ""sick.""   The second time she went in my father dropped us off at our other grandparents' house for the week. He had promised us if we were really good we could spend the week there which was a big deal because they lived in an giant Tudor by the sea. We were on our best behavior, which I now know was unnecessary wasted effort- we could have been little assholes and he would have brought us there anyway. We didn't find out my mom was in the hospital again until overhearing our grandparents talking about it. That was how we found out my mom had something called ""Lupus"" and was taking ""Pregnant Zone"" (Prednisone.) Neither of them came clean about the whole thing until we were teenagers though."
No, I was young and scared. I told my twin I heard Dad crying and she thought maybe he hurt himself. I had my doubts, but that wasn't the first time we'd heard odd noises coming out of my parents' bedroom when the door was closed and my sister and I always came up with innocent and rather silly reasons why.   I don't remember how the kitchen got cleaned up but I *do* remember eating peas and hot dogs for dinner several times after that. My dad would just boil both, so it wasn't difficult. The only hang up was the dishes- I clearly remember eating peas off round plastic Tupperware container lids because there were no clean dishes left.
The top half looks like a perfect [Victoria Sponge](https://www.google.com/search?q=Victoria+Sponge) cake.
There actually is no cure for lupus unfortunately. I encourage anyone struggling to head over to r/lupus. For the most part it‚Äôs a supportive and informative community.
I don't know you but reading this makes me feel actual, deep affection for you and your family.
She did, so did the baby, and neither dad nor I got sick like he'd planned.
Dude this is wholesome as fuck. I'd be SO stoked to receive a stockpile of brand new cool shoes! 
This is the guy that makes the funny one leg Halloween costumes every year https://imgur.com/gallery/dqWiF
In case you guys don‚Äôt know who this is, his name is Josh Sundquist and he‚Äôs an author, motivational speaker, standup comedian, and Paralympic skier. He‚Äôs got loads of hilarious and insightful things to say about being an amputee and being a human in general, and I‚Äôd highly recommend his books, especially *We Should Hang Out Sometime.*
*sole*mates
And here I was, ready to bitch about the obvious typo in the video.  Well played, sir. Well played.
"OP, you should really link to the original with sound. It's actually one of the ten ancient long forgotten internet-norms.  It says, and I quote: ""Thou shall pass on the credit""  Share some credit to the original creator, it's all I'm saying. That and I know videos are usually much better with sound.  Edit: found [it](https://youtu.be/rfxoIm56bsc). He's got a youtube-channel too with more amputee stuff."
"Is there a website that matches people with their ""solemates?"" There has to be, right (err...or left)."
That leg lamp one is gold lol
He‚Äôs awesome but the 2014 one creeps me the fuck out, honestly 
College Humor made a [Tinderella](https://youtu.be/bLoRPielarA) cartoon spoof. Warning, it‚Äôs not wholesome, but it is kinda funny.
>standup comedian  Impressive.
That was literally what they were saying.  
Face: 10/10  Torso: 8/8  Legs:1/2
Looks like theres some pretty good info here, along with a list of charities aswell.  https://www.amputee-coalition.org/resources/shoe-exchanges/
I thought it was one night stand. 
The IHOP one is hilarious though.
I wouldn‚Äôt say he has a leg up on other comedians, but he definitely stands alone.
My brother was born with one club foot and now one foot is 4 sizes smaller than the other. He just buys the bigger size. I must find his solemate now. 
Thought it was the lamp from A Christmas Story
He's a [foosball player](http://youfoosball.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Warrior-foosball-table-game.jpg).
nordstrom will sell you ‚Äúintentional mismate‚Äù if your shoes size is 1.5 or greater in differences! so for instance if one foot is a 6 and the other is 8.5 etc.  //source: i am a shoe sale associate at nordstrom.
That's pretty cool. Seems like it's basically giving somebody a 50% discount on two pairs of shoes.  I wonder if they donate the other side of the mismatch to amputee orgs.
I feel like that's a lot of responsibility for a kitten. They are going to have to live with that choice for the rest of their nine lives.
I like how they showed which one they wanted, the nudged it with their nose and played with it.
"I misread ""kittens"" as ""kids"" and was like ""cool... cool...."""
I‚Äôd like to meet the heavy metal kitten that picked the black collar. I bet he‚Äôs one cool cat.
This way they'll never get to see the collar they love the most
Cat: ‚Äúeww look how ugly this one is!‚Äù  Cat 5 minutes later: ‚ÄúFuck...‚Äù
Maybe they thought their owner was giving them a display of weird snakes that they killed and are now wearing them around as trophies.
Or just until they‚Äôre adopted. They‚Äôre able to be adopted at 8 weeks unless they have a medical issue, these guys look almost that old.
Or until they grow out of it in 2 weeks
They were aggressive towards the one they hated the most
Wait, so the collar my mom keeps on me isn‚Äôt normal?
It looks like there are 9 collars for 5 cats, and the black is one of the few left over unfortunately. No metal kitties today.
Do you not show your cats all the pictures you take of them? How do they know how handsome they are?.
This made me choke on a tortilla chip. Thanks for almost killing me lmaoo
Mission failed we get him next time!
Well I'm still eating chips so if you can crack another joke maybe the mission will succeed!
You've been eating tortilla chips for 20 minutes
When he commits, he really commits.
Wholesome as heck, oh my gosh
Watch him be on Ellen in the next few days
Some classes can get terribly boring and mind numbing, but instructors like this make it that much more tolerable and perhaps even enjoyable.
His smile is contagious. I hope his students are good to him. 
Good teachers who love their jobs are so important.
"My music professor was like this. You could always tell how genuinely happy he was to be in the class and how much he loved teaching but my class especially. Most of us were fine and performing arts kids, and on the last day before finals this semester, he made it a point to say ""I know each and every one of you is going to be famous one day"". He was my FAVORITE teacher of all time and will always be my fav teacher. "
I see  Stevie Janowski went back to teaching
It was one of my professors first semester at my college and she started crying on the last day because she was so proud of all of our final projects. So wholesome and genuine. 
Glad to see Ted Mosby is still enjoying teaching architecture.
That is so fucking sweet I can't handle it
good golly
üëÄ
I was a pretty good student. Not great, but pretty good. I got mostly B‚Äôs, a couple A‚Äôs and the odd C or D in classes I didn‚Äôt care about.  I took advanced physics my last year of high school. I still don‚Äôt know why because it was a dumb move. I never had any intention of pursuing anything physics related but I went for it.  The teacher was incredible. He cared and was positive and really tried to engage the class and make sure everyone was on board. I got an A, and was in the high 90‚Äôs on all my tests/exams/etc.  I‚Äôll never forget Mr. Kouba. Best teacher I‚Äôve ever had, and it‚Äôs not even close. 
Yes we are!
Username checks out.
I‚Äôm gonna resist so he can have some anonymity out of respect for him 
Hey what‚Äôs up 
what does he teach?
A bad teacher can make the easiest subject excruciating while an amazing teacher can make even the most difficult subject fun and interesting. 
What does he teach? 
Its a big problem even in wealthy areas. I had professors at Penn State who were clearly only there for research money/resources and had absolutely zero interest in teaching classes. It was awful because they just slap a powerpoint together and ramble in the student's general direction without really trying to convey any point. The professors that cared had much higher success rates with their students even when teaching the exact same material(at least in my experience thats the way it appeared).  
He would always smile and go slightly too fast cause of how excited he was. On the first day is what made me fall in love with him. He tells us he knows the realities of what college is like. Drugs drinking etc. He said that his house is always open if we needed something. He was my father figure this first semester and I've gained a new appreciation for music and especially classical music because of him. He would go on these weird rants that had nothing to do with class and I loved these. And you should hear him talk about his wife. He just had a huge amount of love and appreciation for things. 
r/beetlejuicing 
Those guys
Writing for communication
1. talks too fast 2. invites students to his house??? 3. talks about drugs and drinking 4. talks about things that have nothing to do with the subject matter  sounds like all the makings of a good instructor.
cool I minored in them
Does he also teach hearing for listening? 
That sounds illegal.
Nah
you're thinking of a major in minors
Finally asking the important questions. 
is he double?
Adam Savage seems like a really nice guy
Now I'm more curious about your mom and why Adam follows her. Is she hilarious?
Your mom is officially way cooler than you now. Hope you're okay with that. My 77 y/o dad, a former DJ and Capitol Records exec is also way cooler than me, always has been. I've learned to roll with that. 
The mythbusters is the reason why I became a Mechanical Engineer and a Automotive Mechanic. I also watched there shows everytime on Discovery Channel and I thank them for all my last minute Science Fair projects, my college theoretical essays, and the likes. The next line of host and engineers has huge shoes to fill to inspire the next generation. 
This myth has been....CONFIRMED!
I have a friend who has met him a few times at conventions‚Äî he remembered her name every time and is always super open to helping out with anything from cosplay to physics. Such an awesome guy, I really hope to meet him some time.
i know right? everything i've ever seen from him makes him out to be this really nice and chill dude 
I remember the drama a few years back when some dad posted a pic of [his young daughter meeting Adam Savage](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/4kn96w/redditors_disappoint_adam_savage_and_fight_about/), and a bunch of (gilded) comments attacked the girl just for having dyed hair (because apparently that meant she was a feminist, which is obviously evil). And then Adam Savage literally came on the post to comment that he was disappointed in reddit that day, lol. That was the first time I ever saw a real celebrity just pop into reddit and comment as themselves on a non-AMA post. 
Haha no, she's not a comedian. She's a lawyer and she tweets mostly about politics.
I know, she's been cooler than me for a long time
He honestly just really seems like the sort of guy where if you saw him and asked for help with your physics homework, and he had the time, he'd sit down at a table and help you work through angular velocity problems.
He seems so fun too. Watching his stuff on YouTube and seeing him get so excited even he's done
Adam Savage presidential run 2020 confirmed.  
/r/wholesomememes  It‚Äôs nice to see kids loving their parents :‚Äô))
Hopefully by blowing shit up
It would actually be amazing to have someone who has a passion for science as president. 
There's imperial evidence for it too, she has like 10,000 twitter followers and I have 7.  Edit: I can't spell
"Seriously.  Because the thing any real scientist knows to do is **listen to other scientists and experts**.  We don't need strong-headed people who already think they know everything, we need people who know that they know almost nothing, and that they need to depend on a large web of brilliant people to come up with modern solutions to modern problems.   I honestly think we need *more* cabinet positions (like ""Secretary of Climate"", ""Secretary of Medical Research"", etc), and I want candidates to flesh out or get commitments from cabinet members *before* voting for them.   Voting for a President should really be about voting for a team, not just one person who says they can fix everything, because no one person can."
Welcome home human, your 2 replacements have not accomplished their job and the food bowl remains empty. Now you're home, do your self a favour and fill it before I erase you.
It's the thought that counts. 
So sweet üòä that must be the universal dad sleeping pose. My dad fell asleep many times with his arms crossed and his head down exactly like that lol
Sounds like me when I was young, oh how the tables have turned
The cat wore them out playing with all the toys.
The cat looks like its guilt tripping you for not coming home earlier
New Bern, NC!  (On your dad's shirt.)  Is that where your parents are from? 
At least the kitty welcomed you home!
I can't imagine how amazing that must feel 
Oh, and don't believe anything the one with the fuzzy lip tells you. He lies. 
what's with all these foreboding cat thoughts? I feel like my cats are always just pining over my inability to understand them; I do understand them, but they puke if i feed them that much. 
Absolutely. Warmed my heart to see this when I walked up to the back door. I've missed them. I tried to get all my work shifts covered but it was last minute notice that they were even coming to stay with me. 
Oh.. my dad does head back, mouth open, remote in hand and his glasses still on. 
Well well well, how the turntables...
You just reminded me how I would try so hard to stay up until 11 when I was little so I'd be awake when my mom would get home from her nursing shift... damn I should call my mom
Your replacements are weak, human! 
Yes, they had to evacuate. 
He has more whiskers than truths told
"Honestly, my cat seems like she's literally just thinking ""?"" or ""!"" the majority of the time."
Its just part of reddit culture that cats are evil overlords. 
My moms parents just visited from Mexico. They are in their late 80‚Äôs and they tried to stay up late too because my mom comes home at 11 pm but they fell asleep too! Man, our parents are the best and I hope I can make  mine proud. 
"""Dad go to bed"" ""I'm not sleeping I'm watching tv"" continues to readjust for 3 mins then knocks out again"
You should. I call my mom regularly, my brother doesn't. So when he does call her just to say he was thinking about her, I get to hear how excited it made her and how much it meant to her.  Call your mom. Tell her you were just thinking about her and that you love her. Do it because one day you won't be able to. 
How are they holding up? How are you holding up? I live in Charlotte and I am the evacuation point for coastal relatives all the time. It can be very stressful for everyone involved. Is their place okay?
Khajiit has wares.
My Nana is only 78 and she's been taking cat naps the last 15 years or so. She sometimes stays up till 11pm but she always wakes up around 3-4am then might go back to sleep from 6-7am.  Watching movies with her is great. Telling her long stories is even more great because once I notice she's fallen asleep I'll start saying random stuff until she wakes up again 20 minutes later. Sometimes I wonder if she's faking and just really likes my bullshit stories. 
Same for my dad. He just needs to watch the first ten minutes of that same Star Trek episode for the tenth time. 
Parents really are the best. Here's a bonus pic from their visit. My dad is busy insisting that there was a really long truck with a really long hitch parked there when he pulled in. My mom is giggling at his parking job.  (My brother looks mildly confused because he's deaf but the situation was explained to him afterwards and he laughed).    https://m.imgur.com/lqCH7z2
Thanks for asking! They got home yesterday to assess the damage. Bunch of debris in the yard. Contents of the garage had floated up about 3 feet, bobbed around, and came to rest in a mildewy pile when the water receded. They are the kind of people who use the garage as a catch-all and park in the driveway, so it's a daunting mess. My dad also had some nice antique woodworking stuff in there. Their house is thankfully in good shape. The surge stopped six inches short of their door. They don't have a basement but all the insulation in the crawlspace is soaked and trashed. The trees held out. My mom is feeling guilty about feeling relieved. A lot of their friends didn't fare as well. Haven't heard if their sailboat is okay (it was dry docked).
If you have coin.
Since she‚Äôs a grandma I can guarantee you that she loves your bullshit stories.  They don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre telling them a story about a piece of bread you found or the time you went hiking with your friends. They just love you and love the fact that you want to share your stories with them.   Damn I love grandparents. 
Try to tell her not to feel guilty, it's a really good thing that they're house and things are mostly ok; the garage stuff is just a good chance to sort through it all.   I know it's hard to be happy when your friends are going through a hard time, but please tell her to enjoy this one blessing. She now has spare energy to help those friends and others in the area who weren't so fortunate.   Hope fixing up the house and garage goes well for them and just wanted to add to have a beer yourself for giving them a place to stay. Nice to see families together when horrible things happen.   Hope you're all well, and best wishes from the UK.   
Oh I meant bullshit stories like having to pay a troll to cross the bridge and my dogs fighting off a dragon. But still, yeah.
Thank you for the kind words! You're absolutely right to embrace having energy and time to help others. They're offering their guest bedroom for use and I'm sure they'll pitch in with clean up. My mom actually went to NOLA after Katrina to help out. They like being helpful. 
I‚Äôm 21 and I still have this reaction when I drink chocolate milk. 
Welcome to the addiction, little one.
the clapping! what a cutie 
That child is now addicted for life lol.
I snuck it into my kiddo‚Äôs bottle once when he was maybe 6 months and my wife was away. He went ‚Äúheheh‚Äù like Beavis. I laughed my ass off and no one else got to witness it. 
1st sip: Woah!  Is that real?  Lemme try again...  2nd sip: Fuck yeah.
This is also my husbands reaction to chocolate milk.  It‚Äôs less cute when they‚Äôre nearing 40, graying, and have a beard. But damn do I love that man anyways. 
Sugar is a hell of a drug. 
*the food industry chuckles secretly*
We fed our child homemade baby food with fresh vegetables and fruits and never introduced bad foods until school age when inevitably they come across them socially.   Well, except for that one time....at a family party I see my 1 year old baby sittin on her great grandfather‚Äôs lap happy as can be. He was feeding her rich chocolate cake and letting her swig down Sprite. I was a mixture of awww how cute and oh man, all that work down the drain!   My grandfather told me that she went ‚ÄúMmmmm‚Äù when she saw the cake on the table so he figured she knew what it was and wanted some.   Now that he‚Äôs gone I treasure that memory of him giving her the first taste of decadence. 
My youngest is 21 and I still have this reaction when I drink chocolate milk. Cheers!
*a cow bows*
Another win for Big Sugar. 
Does anyone remember the video of the super apprehensive dad giving one of his kids a juice box or something for the first time and you can see the sugar addiction in action!
Very pure and wholesome. The comments on these posts always make me smile twice as hard. Hope you two are doing well :)
Indeed, this is not really a reaction to the chocolate or the milk, this is mostly a reaction to the sweetness of the sugar in it. 
"Your comment makes it out to seem that this child is going to be having nothing but chocolate milk for the rest of it's days, we see a glimpse of a parent sharing some chocolate milk with her child, little over dramatic to see you saying that she's going to be ""hooked so young"" when we're just viewing a glimpse of this persons life and have no idea what this kids day-to-day diet is going to be like.  I understand sugar is shitty for you, and especially not great for children but sugar in Moderation isn't that big of a deal."
My chocolate milk is 21 and it still gives me that reaction.
I mean, you ever try deep fried cheesecake?
Part of me wants to ban sugar but the other part of me doesn't give a fuck because I like chocolate milk 
"People want to believe that they have freedom of choice with their food options, but the vast majority are victim to predatory advertising, sugary additives, and instant gratification/ease of access.   Unfortunately companies lobby hard to make sure their food stays addictive under the guise of ""freedom"". And people will fight to the death for it... i.e. the ""soda ban"" in NY."
Children like sweet stuff because of the sugar? Wow. What a concept. 
You should probably get that checked out... 
How about we ban sugar and legalize cocaine.
[This one](https://youtu.be/MNtgXcQeAlg) 
It‚Äôs just chunky lemon chocolate milk. 
>It tastes like vinegar!  >well, you're Filipino, so that makes sense.   I don't understand this, but I sure laughed hard at it.   EDIT: okay, why spell Philippines with a PH and double Ps then Filipino with a fucking F who apparently made off with the other P? To make me look stupid? This is an outrage.
How do i delete someone else's comment
Cocaine makes you thin, sugar makes you fat. 
I still remember getting my first pair of glasses at age 7. In the shop I said ‚Äúso what is the difference?‚Äù  The optician took me outside the shop. I had never seen clouds. I had never seen birds. I had never seen the tops of trees. It was amazing.
I've been wearing glasses since I was six and I've often wondered how different my life would have turned out without the help of corrective lenses. It's a humbling thought. I'm very happy for this baby who can see clearly for the first time.
I see the glasses makes him have the power to glitch reality
I'm bothered by the fact that they appear to be on upside down. 
I was teaching in the infant room at a preschool years ago. We had one kiddo who at 10 months wasn‚Äôt crawling and was very easily upset.  We were worried she had a motor skill or cognitive delay and we tried every trick in our arsenal to help her.  Then she got glasses. Within a few weeks she was crawling, ~~cloning~~ Climbing and causing chaos on par with her peers. Turns out she was nearly legally blind. The world is a scary place when you can barely see it.  Best part is because she started correcting her vision so young she will probably have much better eyesight through her whole life.
He looks like a Ninja Turtle.
I was 11.   40 years later and I still can vividly remember being amazed by leaves on trees.
Lol that happened when I finally got replaced my old glasses I‚Äôve been putting off because I‚Äôm poor, I took a moment and the dude at Costco asked if there is a problem. I think I said something along the lines of ‚Äúno nothing, though I probably shouldn‚Äôt have been driving with my old glasses‚Äù 
I don't know if it was used here, but they have digital eye scanners now that can tell you your prescription without needing your input.
I remember getting my glasses back in sixth grade.... I told my mom I could see things in ‚Äú3D‚Äù
"Hahaaha yeah, when the glasses went on, the gif glitched out and I was like, ""well good thing he has glasses, but too bad they cause his surroundings to melt into indecipherable blobs."""
Maybe it‚Äôs because babies primarily look up. I (not a baby) wear glasses and if I look up, I see frame.
>Within a few weeks she was crawling, cloning and causing chaos on par with her peers  Cloning!?
It's always the leaves.
Actually being able to see individual leaves instead of just one blob of green is the best feeling.
The machine is called an autorefractor. They work by shining a light into the eye and looking into the eye to see how focused the light is on the retina. It then cycles through lenses until the light is focused properly, telling you the prescription needed. It's also quite fast so it can be used on babies who can't sit still for long.  edit: Another user with experience in the eye industry said that a different process called Retinoscopy is used on kids, their break down on the difference can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/arx7ks/baby_gets_glasses_and_can_see_clearly_for_the/egqn1su/)
yeah it feels like going from 360p your whole life to HD
I appreciate that you felt the need to clarify that you are not a baby ü§£
Have babies gone too far?
Can confirm. Third grade. I cried when I found out I would need glasses. I remember leaving the optometrist's office and looking at the 3 trees around it and just being in awe. That was over 20 years ago.
Technology never fails to amaze me 
why isn't this in use for everybody? is it really expensive? i honestly have no idea what the correct answer is when the doctor asks me which of these two identical lenses is better or worse.. it always feels like a guessing game because i honestly can't tell.. so then i wonder if i don't have the optimal lenses for me..
I got my glasses in the third grade too. I lived in NYC so while there weren‚Äôt many trees, seeing the design of buildings was amazing. Funnily enough, while leaving the optometrist I started looking at everything around me. I focused on a pothole across the street only to trip and fall on another one while I was crossing the road.
Ya but vaccines and climate change are fake buddy don't forget ^/s
See i still do this whenever i get a new prescription. Its never the same as that first awe, but its still pretty damn cool
You can literally see the pride on dads face and I love it!  My parents never held onto things like this but in all fairness, I did have a ridiculous amount of siblings. lol
CUM = WITH   LAUDE = PRAISE/DISTINCTION   
How do you graduate high school cum laude?
My sister had bought this big and gorgeous jewelry box. When I saw it I said how pretty it was and wanted to go thru it. She explained her favorites and most expensive were up top. Up top with her most valuable and expensive jewelry was the bracelet I made her when I was about 8. She had kept it for almost 20 years. It still makes me tear up.
That‚Äôs a very proud father right there!   I love the Pikachu tie, it‚Äôs such a sweet proof of good parenting. He kept it all these years and wore it at one of the most important events in his son‚Äôs life.  My parents didn‚Äôt even bother attending my graduation.
I‚Äôm 32 years old. In 7th grade woodshop I  made my Dad a clock painted with the colors of the College where he and my Mom met each other. It‚Äôs still hanging in his office üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠. 
Lol cum
How many siblings  did/do you have 
The dude draws better pokeballs than I do
You have to look like you're graduating college.
A ridiculous amount. 
I have 6 sisters and 3 brothers 
"""I thought it meant he cums loudly!"""
Reddit loves a low effort joke. 
I know the feeling.  
That‚Äôs a party haha
That's what she said
Username checks out.
Yup. In the worst possible way... üòÇ  I have siblings that are younger than my kids

Source/backstory: this is my aunt's friend who works as a school secretary. This girl visits her to say hello every day. She is in a foster family who have been trying to adopt her for a few years, but ran into increasing legal problems. They got the news that the adoption miraculously went through and decided that secretary should deliver this news. :) posted with permission from them.

She was so happy she didn't even know what to do with her legs.
I work in mental health and large amount of my clients come from abusive homes, whether biological or foster. So many mental health issues that may have never occurred if they simply had a nurturing environment. Seeing a little girl that thrilled to be brought into a loving home warms my heart. Her life may have been saved from whatever may have came down the line.   Edit:My highest comment ever, so I'm getting on my soap box. If you are considering adoption,  please do.  We have far more children than good parents. And teens are often left to trudge through the system. Please, if you are considering adoption,  remember that you may literally be their last hope. 
I‚Äôve been having a rough day and this just made me cry but in a really amazing and cathartic way.   I think this just gave me the motivation to make today awesome.  I‚Äôve been looking for that motivation for hours.  Thanks for posting OP.     Edit-  I want to tell you all how much I love you.   You have no idea how much every single message means to me.   I appreciate every single one of you that took a few minutes out of your day to help cheer me up.   You have single handedly improved my day more than you will every know.  Because of you i just crushed 16.5 miles on my bike when a few hours ago I decided I was just gonna nap instead.  Thank you for the motivation.  I needed you all today.  Same time tomorrow???!! üòúüòò   Hope you all have a great day!   
I was this kid when i was in the second grade.  Happened in my school‚Äôs front office too. What a great day. So happy for this kid.
Made me smile?! More like made me bawl like a baby. So heartwarming
Dad guy isn‚Äôt impressed. 
Well, that brought a tear to my eye.
awwwwwwww, that is SO sweet!! Sweet of the family to include her, and just a lovely story all around. Definitely made me smile :)
My eyes are broken they keep leaking. 
The fact that she goes to say hello every day is adorable. Happy for her and the family and everyone involved. :)
I‚Äôm too pregnant to handle this much emotion... 
Wow a student who visits to say hello every day. Sweet child.
Grown man crying here.

I was only about to cry and then I read this comment. And now I‚Äôm just full on sobbing. 
I don't work in mental health, but I grew up in an emotionally abusive home and I know the toll it took on myself and my brother. I also read a lot about true crime and psychology and heard so many sad stories about the damage a bad home can have.  All this is to say that I live for moments like the one in this video even if I can't be a part of them myself. So touching.
Things will get better, friend. Just hang in there and don't give up or lose hope. :)
That feeling of being apart of a family that wants to love and care for you so much that they are willing to go through hell and back to have you be in their family. Words can't express that feeling. 
He's just mad he hasn't been adopted yet.
such unbridled joy! It was so nice to watch.
/r/MadeMeSmile should really be /r/MadeMeCry 
Did you know swans can be gay?
Omg thank you for this now I can die happy
Thank you!!!   I‚Äôm usually feeling great and ready to kick the day in the face but I think I‚Äôm just a little down because my hubby is working a few states away this week so I‚Äôm a single mom for a few more days and just having a hard time because I didn‚Äôt sleep well, my baby is teething so she isn‚Äôt really eating well and is feverish, just normal crap like that.  I usually work out while she naps but i was feeling so down today that I thought I would skip it and just nap instead knowing that it was gonna make me feel worse later.   You have made me feel so much better that I think I‚Äôm gonna at least start working out and see how far I get.  Thanks for taking a minute out of your day to send me some positive energy!  I truly am feeding off of it.  Thank you, my friend.

A sacrifice has been promised. Will you take their place?
Hey buddy, keep your chin up. Life is so radically different from where you are to where you'll be in a year, in 5 years, in 10. I know it feels like a never-ending slog towards futility and uselessness, but it won't always! Whether it's finding the right person, the right career, the right hobby, the right friends, or hell, the right combination of meds and therapy, there will come a time where it's not going to feel this helpless. You're almost to the next *huge* step in your life, but you gotta keep working at it. If you can't keep working at what you're trying to do now, make a change. Make a BIG change if you need to. But don't give up before even trying.   You aren't useless, you aren't a burden, and you do matter. 
I am. A grown man foster parent crying on my lunch break.

‚ÄúI mean- jus- jus- jus- look at that lil thing. I just couldn‚Äôt help it, what. a. cute. baby!‚Äù
I love the look he‚Äôs giving Michelle in the first picture. He‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou seeing this, Michelle look how funny it is‚Äù
I like how the images are framed so it appears Pope Baby has no parents. Like PB is just cruising around the area in a mini pope mobile.
I remember when the US President used to have a sense of humor.
"Imagine the bragging rights this kid will have later in life.  ""Yeah you know the Obama baby Popemobile photos?  That was *me*."""
I miss his face
Fox News would report this as...‚ÄùRepublicans outraged..Obama laughs in Popes face‚Äù
These photos were taken by Pete Souza, the official White House photographer during the Obama administration. He put together[ a book of his favorite images](https://www.amazon.com/Obama-Intimate-Portrait-Pete-Souza/dp/0316512583) of which this series is in because it‚Äôs fantastic.
You might not like Obama, but you have to admit, he seems to be a pretty cool dude.  Edit: god, I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything.
"Every prez I remember had a sense of humor. I've never seen the current one have a natural smile.  Trump's ""smile"" scares me. "
21:10 https://youtu.be/IwVPlcMu0bs
I miss having a president with... humanity.
‚ÄúI mean, the crazy thing [pause]... the crazy thing is that, this person is a baby. Babies, can‚Äôt even walk. But this baby [pause], this baby is, the freakin‚Äô pope. How accomplished of a baby [pause], does a baby have to be, to become the pope?! It‚Äôs crazy!‚Äù
I listened to her interview in the Conan podcast and they seem like the greatest couple.   Apparently the sitting president actually gets billed for the food they eat. I did not know this.   There was a time Barack liked this sushi and the chef said they‚Äôll order more and Michelle goes ‚Äúoh no we are not. We are paying for that.‚Äù  
Yeah, even Bush was funny on occasion. 
STEPHANOPOULOS: You notice something else -- during that dinner. You say the President didn't laugh.  COMEY: Yeah, not at all. And I was struck by it. So struck by it, it stayed with me, that I've never seen him laugh. Not in public, not in private. And at a dinner with someone -- I mean, I'm not a comedian but I occasionally say something that's funny that people chuckle with each other.  But I never saw anything that resembled a laugh. And I could over-interpret that, I could be -- also, we're missing something that -- that maybe he's -- he's breaking up in stitches with other people other than the FBI director, but I also tried -- after I got fired, I thought -- that stayed with me. And so I went and tried to find examples of videos where he's laughing and I could only find that really wasn't a genuine laugh.
Your comment made me realize that I have never ever seen Trump genuinely laugh or smile. Not once.
+/- on number of years before the kid sets up his reddit account to start farming that karma?
I miss his hugs :(
Where did we go wrong from here? Race aside, how did we go from this amazing gentleman to what we have now? Blows my fucking mind. 
Michelle be like: we get it honey it's funny but not *that* funny
This. Killed. Me. Hahahahahah spot on in the top left picture those are exactly the subtitles for that shot 
You know they're good people when they care about little things even when they're on top of the world, just shows how opposite they are to so many other people who find themselves on top of the world.
That story and a lot of others like it is also in her book ‚ÄúBecoming‚Äù and I really couldn‚Äôt recommend it more. The way she writes you can tell her and Barack‚Äôs relationship is so full of respect and mutual affection, and it was funny to realize that they met because he was a intern at work when she was working in corporate law.   Anyway, great book. And she narrates the audiobook. 
"""You got sushi money?"""
Are you kidding me, Bush was hilarious! It was just that most of the time it was unintentional.   ...*I believe that the human and the fish can coexist peacefully* 
I miss his mental stability 
I love that she openly makes fun of him...I think there's a colbert episode where she imitates him too...like, old married couple levels of cute...gonna look that up now
Yeah I miss having a president that didn't want to give off the sense of impropriety by accepting even a free meal. Now we have a dude who won't divest from his businesses and people openly book rooms at his hotel to court him. 
Some people are just really tight with money though, no matter how much of it they have. Just saying, since some people like to see everything as more than it is. 
^How ^many ^people ^is ^a ^Brazilian?
*‚ÄúI want gynecologists to be able to practice their love on women.‚Äù*  Nothing will top that one to me.
And his competence. 
I miss his ability to choose good people to give power to
His leadership is what I miss the most. 
Obama did a town hall recently talking about modern masculinity. The thing that made headlines was him saying you don't need 8 women around you twerking. But the entire thing is awesome, he just basically gave out a bunch of good advice on being a good man and a good human being.  Obama made it a point that strength isn't what you wear or how you flaunt your riches. His strength is internal, and I respect that. The Obamas are a model family that people around the world look up to.   https://youtu.be/w28OqqTrCbA   https://youtu.be/c_z0h9mTefY  
I miss them soooo much!!! üò©üò¢ü•∫
Is our children learning to put food on their family?
And his human decency. 
What a man, what a man, what a mighty good man.   I really do miss him.
>The Obamas are a model family that people around the world look up to.   This person from India agrees. 
https://youtu.be/jiMUoVjQ5uI?t=286
And his ability to speak.
Regardless of where you stand politically can‚Äôt we all agree that we miss having an articulate president that is scandal free? The Obama‚Äôs were practically the ideal nuclear family except for that one thing that drives Trump‚Äôs fan base crazy.  Edit: tense 
"Both.   Bush: ""Is our children learning?""  Also Bush: ""and you're working hard to put food on your family.""  The stroke mangled them together. "
I‚Äôm not even American, and I still miss him. 
Somehow this makes me miss him even more. We could only watch from the sidelines as disaster struck. We still do.
"I was leaving the market yesterday and a fellow asked for a dollar. I said sorry I don't have any cash and he looked directly in my eyes and said, ""No man, don't be sorry."" Made me realize how hard it must be for him to ask strangers for money. As I walked away I realized I actually did have cash for once but he didn't hear me when I called out. Ended up jumping in my car to chase him down. He was very grateful. When he grabbed the cash I saw his hand was wrapped in duct tape which I imagine was due to injury. No matter how bad things are, someone always has it worse. "
I‚Äôm always conflicted over these I love seeing them but also don‚Äôt like that they record people at their lowest and most vulnerable points. 
Uncynical take. These gentlemen did a good thing. In 2018 people record everything. Bless these people for doing a good thing. They only asked that the good will be passed along. Please unharden y‚Äôall‚Äôs collective hearts.   There are plenty of subreddits  where people are not nice to each other. Let‚Äôs not let this one become one of those.   
This is awesome. I haven‚Äôt told my wife, kids, friends etc and don‚Äôt think I ever will but about a month ago I was getting gas and grabbed some stuff inside the store when I heard a woman behind me come in all stressed saying she gave attendant $2 for gas on pump 3 but it wasn‚Äôt working, he told her to move to pump 2 but was not very accommodating. It was early morning I was tired and grumpy so I ignored it. When I walked out I could see she was visibly upset taking to herself about the pump not working and overall distressed. I asked if she needed anything and she told me how she gave the attendant $2 but couldn‚Äôt get pumps to work. She was starting to tear up and talking about needing to get her sister to dialysis appointment and just needed the pumps to work- I told her I would get her gas, pulled out my CC and started pumping. Over the next 2 mins she was super upset, was in town from Tennessee (I live in KC) staying with her dying mom, taking her sick sister to the Dr and was just at the end of the rope. She was on fumes and as bill rises she kept saying that‚Äôs all I need - I just need to get to midtown, she was blown away when tank topped off at $56 and kept asking for my biz card to send me money. I was happy to be fortunate enough to help a stranger truly in need and never expected a penny. I never thought I would tell that story until I saw this.   Good men these bros are.

Simran Singh, the guy who posted it, made an exceptionally moving message in the comments:  >There‚Äôs so much negativity in the news these days.

I mean I don't care if this is for views, if you're doing something right it's awesome; they could be pranking or some other shit
I can feel her emotions through this video. Sheez. Idk what shes going through but its heart breaking. I can only imagine that the things I complain about are no where near her problems. Those are some good people performing good acts. True love.

Filming this shit is pathetic, just help her instead of showing everyone how good you are. 
A homeless man asked me if I could light his cigarette outside the liquor store tonight. When I told him he could keep my lighter, his eyes lit up.
There was a homeless guy outside a convenient store around the corner from my house. When I walked out i had 2 scratch offs in my hand and he asked me for some change for a bus ticket. I said I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt have any. I got in my vehicle and scratched off the ticket and I had a $2 winner. He was still sitting there so I rolled my window down and gave it to him. I watched him go inside and left.  My mind wondered if he‚Äôd taken the cash or bought another ticket or a 32 oz with it. I went about my business and drove back by about twenty minutes later and he was standing at the bus stop waiting for  the bus.  He did not lie, dude needed a bus ticket. He was also very grateful.  Now I actually keep a new package of socks in my truck and give them to homeless people when I‚Äôm stopped on a corner.    There was an ask Reddit thread I read one time and the question was ‚Äúpeople of reddit who have been homeless, what are some misconceptions about your life when you are homeless?‚Äù One of the top answers was, ‚ÄúOMG we always need socks! You have no idea how wonderful a new pair of socks make your quality of life‚Äù. Socks are cheap, so I figure I can do this to make that extra little contribution to society.
"*""be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a battle*""- Plato"
man a good deed is a good deed - especially with how fucking miserable 90% of news is these days. i‚Äôm glad to see this stuff, so long as they don‚Äôt take the money from her once the recording stops.   there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being selfishly selfless - as long as it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of the actual charity. 
I agree, but they are doing so to spread the message.
People doing the right things for the wrong reasons is still a net positive. I think most can agree to that no matter thier feelings elsewhere in the equation.
I was conflicted at first but then I got around to the idea that people film horrible shit all the time. *Why not* film something good and share it? as long as the deed holds after the cameras are off then there's nothing I should be concerned about.
I mean, from what I know about the current sociopolitical climate in the US, I sure as heck don't blame any minority (especially young black males interacting with older white women) from filming whatever they do lest it be interpreted as something negative. 
My dad and I were up in Pennsylvania for the funerals of his two grandchildren (house fire :( ) and a couple came into the hotel after us with a bunch of luggage and a kid in a car seat.    Apparently their car was totaled by a semi going down hill and they were stuck 3 hours from home with no car.  So he drives them home.  Turns out they lived on his old street in Brooklyn. 
You're a good person. Thank you.
Fuckin stepped on an onion bro. Why is there an onion on the floor?
Dude on the right straight up starts crying right away!  Then I started crying.
The homeless people with the dogs get me. Because their dogs always looks healthy and happy even if the guy looks starving and overall unhealthy.   And i think the guy must be giving everything he has to the dog for his dog to look so well taken care of. 
"Three young black men see a older white woman who needs some help. They are probably good men and think ""hey let's give this lady some of our pocket money and film it to show someone else how to be kind"" then they capture something they wouldn't have imagined and she needed that kindness more than they could have imagined.   I can understand why, hopefully it will be more than just a happy coincidence. Hopefully it will encourage others to care more about strangers outside of their social circles"
I think they said they are comedians? They probably film everything. 
Pay it Forward. Very important concept more people should espouse.
Exactly. For example, people say ‚Äúcorporations donate to charities for the tax breaks. What good are they doing?‚Äù Ask the kids they‚Äôre feeding or the widows they‚Äôre clothing if it matters what the reason they‚Äôre donating is. It‚Äôs still doing good, who cares what reason it‚Äôs for? 
His grandchildren had just died, and he gave strangers a ride home? A three hour drive at that. Your dad is a God mate.
Who‚Äôs cutting Legos??
When you're homeless and have a dog it's usually all you have in the world so you love the shit out of it
There is this homeless man at my local Safeway and one night I decided to buy us both some dinner and sat outside and ate/talked with him. (I‚Äôve always been interested in hearing homeless people‚Äôs stories.) As I sat down, he was confused at first, so I said, ‚ÄúI thought you would like some company.‚Äù He then started crying because apparently his dog, the only living thing he would have a conversation with, died the week before. This was his first conversation with anything since then. I was so stunned by this realization, that now I have dinner with him 2-3 times a week if he‚Äôs there at the same spot on the ground at that Safeway.  I cannot image how awful it must be to not have someone to talk with. It‚Äôs astounding how a simple thing can mean the world to someone else.  EDIT: Thank you kind sir/madam for the silver! I was not expecting that at all. That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve gotten something like that on Reddit!
"I've been in a similar position. I don't care if they brought a whole camera crew, I would have been appreciative to eat something that I didn't either steal or dig out of the trash. It pisses me off (not you, just people who say this shit in general) to see people say shit like ""You gave someone $100 but you probably made more than that in views"" or ""If you're going to do it for selfish reasons, don't do it at all. It's exploitative.""  On my mama, I don't care about your reasons or motivations, and neither do countless people out there on the street that need help every single day just to stay alive. There are people out there sucking dick in back alleys for formula to feed their baby. You think they care about being on youtube? Society has failed them. Let them enjoy a brief respite from their hardships. They're not the ones ruining the act of kindness. People that would discourage others that might want to do the same are, and that's a lot more damaging that pointing a camera at someone at the first moment they've felt genuine happiness in likely a very long time, no matter how brief that feeling is. "
  I‚Äôve always believed that we need to set aside all the old labels (e.g. colour, race, religion etc.) that have divided us. What (to me) really matters is if a person seeks to be kind, compassionate and ‚Äúgood‚Äù or if they prefer to (sadly) do harm and foster evil.  In watching this, I thought that these young men, irrespective of why they were recording video, reached out to someone because they could see she was in need and then that she was in terrible pain...and they offered kindness and charity. This puts them in the ‚Äúgood‚Äù group - for me. :-)  Nothing else matters, except perhaps that the kindness continues and grows as others consider their example.      
I've never felt older by saying this, but it seems like anyone under 20 records everything they do.
And for the many homeless people who have severe mental issues their dog is often the only living being they are able to have a connection with.
We had a local guy who‚Äôs dog was always borderline fat when this guy was looking like he was starving. Turns out that local businesses were also more likely to feed his dog than him, which he gratefully accepted. His dog ended up freezing to death in his sleeping bag one year.  Made me realize just how shitty my tiny hillbilly town really was despite being ‚Äúgood Christian folk‚Äù I worked at a pizza place at the time and occasionally a whole large pizza would get ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù for both of them. I hope he‚Äôs ok.
While I agree those things shouldnt divide us, I think they should bring us together.  We should be happy to share our differences! To spread the stories and meals and clothing and traditions our great great grandparents gave us!  We are different, and it's not a bad thing. Rather than saying it doesn't matter, we should say it isn't a bad thing.   But I agree it's totally useless to point out in this situation. 
I am, right this minute, in the process of removing myself from your lawn. 
And dogs don‚Äôt mind the street life, better than an owner that locks you in a cage for 8-10 hours a day. 
Dude, my ex girlfriends family used to cage their dogs. I had never seen that before. That was fucked. It's like.. WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU HAVE LARGE DOGS and then keep them in cages in your room? And they were the sweetest dogs too. Pissed me off. 
Yeah, I had two German Shepherds in a small house. They were outside most of the time in the fenced yard with their dog houses. But would be kept inside at night and when we weren't home. There was rarely an issue, other than the occasional digging through trash.  But I know someone that got a dog and would cage it. I thought that was insane, but when they tried to not crate, the dog destroyed everything.  So yes, it may be due to shitty owners, but maybe it's because some dogs are too destructive when unsupervised.
As a dog trainer and owner of three Belgian mals.  Puppies are destructive.  Dog properly exercised both physically and mentally are not destructive.  Adult dogs destroy things because they are bored/have too much energy.  If you cage your dog and don't properly exercise them they become destructive.
My dog has severe separation anxiety which makes him destructive and likely to pee and poop in the house (which he has literally never done once other than pre house breaking). I built a large 15ftx15ft Kennel for him in the basement during the winter months so he at least has room to stretch his legs and walk around a little when the weather doesn't let me leave him outside. It's not always just a lack of training. 
Love how dad sits there all chill knowing how excited mom will be. üòä
She's so happy that she's hopping around like a puppy when their favourite person comes home. That's amazing!

I work in a jewellers and have sold A LOT of rings to guys this past week. I thought about all those girls opening their presents this morning and it made me smile knowing I was apart of that! Merry Christmas everyone 
I lost a diamond out of my wedding ring a couple of years ago while on vacation.  All I could do was cry. My husband and daughter started searching in the carpet of our hotel room and he found it! I cried even harder after that. 
A better feeling than receiving a gift is giving that special gift to someone knowing that they‚Äôll love it
To everyone asking about why it took so long to replace/why did they not insure the ring:  They did insure it. And they got the money, but they decided to spend it raising us instead of getting a new ring. We are all in college/graduated now, and are more financially independent of them. So it was the perfect timing.   Also here‚Äôs the ring for those of you that asked :)  https://i.imgur.com/9FlOJOq.jpg
This is so sweet and uplifting!
i love his reaction too,,,, he's so happy to see her happy im fucked up
I lost my engagement ring and was absolutely sick about it. About 3 months later I noticed my goat chewing on something and said, ‚ÄúBrad, what do you have?‚Äù  He promptly spit out my ring. I almost cried and I did kiss that goat. Here is my good boy: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/uAECPOd
Except he kinda grins and goes red. 
I wasn‚Äôt that chill watching my wife open her box of makeup this morning. I would have to leave the room for something like this.
That‚Äôs the look of a man with a ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù card.
Very good gift and she appreciated it a lot. Merry Christmas everyone!
Totally. He's also about to get mad laid. 
My favorite part was the, ‚ÄúDAAAAAAAAAAD!‚Äù part. Like the daughter was hit as surprised and excited. 
me too...even today of all days they won‚Äôt talk to each other
My parents didn‚Äôt hate each other but were never this affectionate and ended up getting a divorce. And my grandparents don‚Äôt show much love either. I hope my boyfriend and I can break the circle. 
/r/humantippytaps
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mo‚Äô bigger‚Äù.  His attempt to diffuse his tearful happy emotion with comedic relief. Well played, but we all saw it. What an awesome moment for that couple. 
I‚Äôm a jeweler and has this same thought. It‚Äôs a good feeling knowing I‚Äôm a part of happy memories like this. 
My aunt lost her diamond ring in the front yard of my grandparents place. Grandpa got everyone off the lawn and banned anyone from walking there the rest of the evening. As soon as it was dark out he went out with a flashlight and found the ring within a minute in the yard. When the beam hit it it lit up like a beacon, also the reason he made us all stay off the grass was so we wouldn't accidentally press it into the dirt while looking for it.  He was a smart old guy.
My wife dropped her ring down the drain at a hotel. She freaked and didn't say anything since she had it maybe a year at that point. I had to take the P trap apart which seemed it was never cleaned ever. I found the ring stuck in a lump of something I never want to learn was made of and cleaned it later in a sonic bath. 
My step mom lost her diamond from her ring while in a crowded indoor water park. My cousin and I decided to look for it and lo and behold I found it shining at the bottom of a pool filled with people. Still can‚Äôt believe how lucky we got. Imagine being someone else in that pool and finding a big ole diamond. 
My mom lost her diamond one day in the kitchen, my dad took apart the trap in the sink to no avail. Eventually, maybe ten years later when they had enough money they bought a new ring. She still had the old setting. Then one day, 20 years after she had lost the diamond she found it in a crack between two pieces of linoleum in the flooring. She couldn‚Äôt believe that she had washed that floor for 20 years and never seen it.

The real diamond was your dad all along üíé
That was my sister. She was just shocked. Also he didn‚Äôt tell *anyone* he was going to do it. So maybe she was slightly upset she wasn‚Äôt in on it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è all I knew was to film it, not what it was. He was quite the sneaky sneak.
Think that‚Äôs just the eggnog.
He‚Äôs getting laid tonight
I bet she was so happy! Makeup can be a tough thing to shop for when it comes to other people, I'm sure you went to so much effort and thought. Happy Christmas!
This is the Christmas I want to see on Reddit. Not the ‚ÄúI hate dealing with family‚Äù BS that gets posted. 
I know I‚Äôm a random redditor, but I‚Äôm sorry. 
"For a second I thought he meant he had to get it sized up and I was thinking, ""NO, DON'T SAY THAT!""  But then I realized he had more diamonds added."
do you make crazy bank this time of  year or what
Yes, he was.
Damn, is he looking for any auxiliary grandkids?    Makes me think that I really should be visiting and spending time with lonely seniors at care homes.  There must be a lot of wisdom there not getting passed on.
Bruh, he gettin his soul sucked out.
YouTube makes it easier. You just watch to see what pallet they keep watching and ranting about. 
At first, I thought, damn 15 years is a long time to have no ring, but dude gave her an inflation-adjusted diamond.  Well done and Merry Christmas!
I hate dealing with my family, like really hate it. Yesterday turned into an argument between my family members bc of a white elephant rule.   And then I come to my in laws and a complete 180. Gifts that are considerate and unique, but the feeling of a happy and loving family is probably the best gift that I could get. 
aww, thank you kind stranger...i‚Äôve gotten used to it, it is what it is
No they‚Äôre jewelers, so they make a lot of rings, necklaces, earrings, etc, not banks.
Not even for a several thousand dollar ring? I‚Äôm pretty sure id rip a sink apart for $50
Dad, get off reddit 
What‚Äôs ‚Äúoff reddit‚Äù?
It's so sad and heartwarming at the same time.Thank you op for standing beside your father.
This is so precious because one day, when your dad is gone, you don‚Äôt have to ask yourself if he knew how much you loved him. And that‚Äôs of so much value.
Hug your dad for me. Tell him it will get better.
"When I was in college my mom asked me ""What is one thing that you know for certain and no one could ever convince you it wasn't true?"" She gave me some time to think about it, and my response was that I knew she and my dad loved me. She was over the MOON about it, because apparently it was some thought experiment some other friends got from a professor.  She asked my brother the same thing and he said ""I know I can beat up a baby.""  Honestly.  Edit: For context, he was in his twenties at the time."
Man, I really hope he pulls through it alright. He seems like he‚Äôs a really good guy, and while seeing this was sad it made me smile still. It‚Äôs the little things like this that can make the biggest difference to someone, especially in their time of need. Best of wishes to you guys
You made his day. He needs you now. Keep it up.
My dad sends me the same message every morning.  Keep it up! I‚Äôm serious. Tell him every day. It keeps me going.
He's been the rock of our family for as long as I can remember, so it's honestly such an honor to be able to help him in any way.  Edit: Wow, thank you for the gold!    My dad's not a Reddit guy (I'm working on that) but I told him he's a celebrity on here now and he said he's bummed that he doesn't get to sign autographs. Now I have to explain to him that some people have enjoyed this post so much that they paid actual money to put virtual gold medals on it. He's gonna get a kick out of that!   Edit 2: I've had a really hard time keeping up with this but I just wanted to say THANK YOU to everyone wishing my family well, sharing their wonderful stories, and for being all around really nice human beings.    There are some people who think my dad's comment was a dig at my mom, but I can guarantee you that's not the way he meant it. He's had to ask his kids for a lot of help lately, which he hates doing, and he's had to be extremely vulnerable with us. We've assured him time and time again that we want to help him and that it's good for him to ask. These texts were following a really rough day of figuring out legal paperwork and things he needed to do and all of us kids were there, in person, helping him. I honestly think he's just overwhelmed by our love and support right now and THAT'S where this comment came from.
Thanks for making me cry at work. But you're so right, I will hold onto this forever ‚ù§Ô∏è
I definitely will!
That is so sweet!! She will remember that forever, I'm sure üòä   Aaaaaand then there's your brother. Hopefully she at let got a laugh out of that one!
Thank you. There are definitely times where it seems like I'm talking to a brick wall because he's so numb and overwhelmed, but I will never stop reminding him that I love him!
He's one of the best people I've ever known. Not without flaws of course, but he's unfailingly kind and loving. Basically the polar opposite of my mom. My brothers and I are doing everything we can to help and support him!
My mom has always been a pretty terrible person. I've tried many times to... Help her, but she's in her own world where she's never wrong and always the victim and her favorite pastime is belittling people. My brothers and I tried to do a conference call with her a while ago to try to figure out what on earth she was thinking and try to get her to see any kind of reason, but it only lasted for a few minutes before she hung up. We've all given up hope that we'll have a healthy relationship with her ever again, not that we really did before...
Sounds like you were raised right :)
I have been through a divorce with a young child and I give you a lot of props because every divorce is hellish and (depending on your age) child custody is the next level of hellish times. You post a gem during such a hard time and I know that during these hard times it is so very very difficult to stay positive and keep your head above water. Good on you kid, good on you
i‚Äôm coming up on seven years without my old man, and i still constantly go back and read emails/texts/correspondence. hold onto this one. might be a cool thing to print and keep in your wallet.
Seriously. Hug him more. Not allowed to let go. I'm not crying. You are.
Thanks to him, yes ‚ù§Ô∏è
Fortunately my brothers and I are all in our mid-late twenties so he doesn't have to worry about that. Thank you!
I don't want to think about him ever being gone, but I know I will have so many wonderful memories to keep him alive in my heart!
Yes I am crying!!! Doing my best to not think about him dying someday. I'm in hardcore denial.
Now about your username....
"My dad made a lot of mistakes in my life, but if there is one thing he never never messed up was telling me how proud he was of me and how much he loved me on a near constant basis.  My dad has also been gone for a bit (almost 5 years now), and I still have 15-20 voicemails from him right before he died, and each one ends with ""I love you."""
94th time is a charm
Ugh, my heart! I'm so glad you have those memories.
He summoned all his dad strength he had to get that jar open ASAP
I've seen this so many times, but never saw how much she struggled before she handed it off. Makes it even better
That‚Äôs Elisa Fernandes, from the first season of Masterchef Brazil, in 2014  This was the last challenge, and she ended up winning said challenge and thus, the competition.
Whats she doing with that cleaver? She gonna cut a finger off.
Dad's like fuck now I got a messy pasta sauce lid
Super strength came out when needed.
Never seen the full gif of this. That extra 10 seconds really delivers the drama. 
Her trying to use that cleaver makes my butthole pucker. Not safe. The way to use the knife properly is use the butt bottom to jab a hole in the lid. It will depressurize the jar and make it easy to open. 
My nightmare would be me being the dad in that situation only being unable to open the jar. I‚Äôm trying to imagine what I would do then, but I have no idea. Give the jar back to her with an apologetic shudder? Is there any option? The rest of the group would be staring at me wasting my daughter precious seconds. I already failed as a father and I‚Äôm not even one yet
I hope I can be a dad like that who my girl(s) can rely on for anything, one day
I feel you can see the exact moment when she thinks ‚Äúdamnit I wish my dad was here to help‚Äù then she realizes he is and runs over to him. 
Jars. The primary killer of single women everywhere.
I've said this every time this gets reposted.  If his hands tore straight off at the wrist, he was getting that fucking jar open. 
Turn that sucker over and whack it on the counter a few times
That mans a champion 
Precious. I'd be just as urgent in taking the lid off as that dad there.
That thing could have been superglued shut, dad would still open it!
All dads around the world channelled their energy to him in that moment. 
Serious. Did you see him shake his hand afterwards? He straight up probably tore a ligament. But he was damned if he wouldn't get that lid off for his daughter. 
"That look on his face just screams ""there is nothing on Earth that is going to stop me from opening this jar."" "
"""Forgive me master, I'm gonna have to go all out"""
She loosened it though
This is how my buddy did after he and his girlfriend had an argument.  They'd sorta not talk to each other for a bit.  So he would secretly tighten the jars in the kitchen and she would eventually ask him to open one.  Then they would talk again and and usually work through their argument eventually.  
Yeah she only went to dad when she NEEDED him and that‚Äôs like a true ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs girl‚Äù not that pretty princess crap 
My favorite bit is the way the dad holds onto the lid from the jar and briefly looks down at it like fuck guess I'm holding onto this for the rest of the competition. 
I guarantee you she started increasing her grip strength after that show. Never know when you‚Äôll need it. 
Cool. Didn‚Äôt know getting external help was allowed in these kind of stuff.
Hi! I'm stress and I'll make you do terrible things! 
The vacuum seal on the lid is making it very difficult to turn. By wedging the cleaver between the lid and the rim of the jar, the chef can break the seal by essentially using the knife as a lever to separate the two.  Generally, this is an unsafe and stupid thing to do, since you can also thwack the lid a few times with the spine of the knife - Introducing dents in the lid will break the vacuum and allow you to open the jar much more easily. 
All she had to do was use it to make the smallest imaginable hole in the lid to release the vacuum in the jar holding the lid fast. I do this at home for those extraordinary situations where I cannot open a lid with my manly grip.
I bet he's cool with it. He's gonna put it in the drawer where he keeps all the shitty mugs and ashtrays she made for him in elementary school.  That's a proud Dad.
98 str
The look on his face when he looks at his hand.. 'i promised I would never use my powers again'
Yea, before I was like, hey that's pretty cool that she thought to go to her dad.  But now it's like, you can see the fear in her and her parents eyes and the build up to the dad just charging all his dad strength to get that jar open to end his daughters suffering for the moment she decides to runs up.
I always just hit the edge of the lid, with a blunt object, a few times to create a couple dents. It usually breaks the seal or weakens it and then the lid comes right off. 
That's actually not an option in the cosmic rules, even if you tried you would still have had opened that jar for your daughter, maybe not for your wife, but your daughter gives you that jar and if your start struggling you'd black out for a second and then wonder why the Jar is open and your hand doesn't want to move anymore.
I‚Äôm sure you will be. 
Disagree, she probably just thought it was against the rules and then just decided to say fuck it
Saviors of every men¬¥s confidence
I don't think this would be in this subreddit if the dad started whacking it on the counter.
Then, he is not the real dad
Idk why but this sounds so wholesome. 
Better dad than goku 
You know how sometimes your dad will just stop and stretch? It's the father channel ritual. Don't touch the remote during the father channel ritual.
In that moment, I would have ripped my hand off to get that lid off.
I think that was just him realizing he still had the lid. 
The redhead beside him is on a hell of an emotion rollercoaster. 
"""Just this once"""
Don't you dare
Your buddy is a fucking genius.
Honestly I would probably not even eat anything that's in a jar if that happened to me. It would be too embarrassing.
I‚Äôve heard this story before. 
This sounds personal.
"I bet he turned to the mom after that and whispered. ""Hey. Souvenir!"""
Looks like she was trying to do it with that cleaver but it was too big for that.  Poor woman. 
I just tap the lid on the counter - all the way around until it loosens. It hasn't failed me in half a century. 
They have ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù  (for example, on season 1, 2 cooks didn‚Äôt know how to use the pressure cooker, and one contestant had broke her ~~foot~~ toe), they can help by getting ingredients/pans/etc. Only thing they cannot do is cook for them. Elisa could have asked for one of those helpers who were closer, but instead, she asked for her father who was at the other side of the room. Pure love (:
‚ÄúWell, your recipe was amazing and executed perfectly. The taste and look of your dish was far superior to the other competitors‚Äô. HOWEVER... you did not open the jar of pickles on your own, and thus you are disqualified from the competition.‚Äù
Hi stress, I'm dad.
God damn it, dad.
I always feel like a badass pirate when I stab the jar with a knife when my wife can't open it. I don't know why but there is something satisfying in piercing that lid.  I have little kids and they look at me like I'm the strongest man alive, that helps  My wife hates it, that helps too
Did you make an ashtray for your dad??
Half of 99 is 92
Correct. Dads draw energy from other dads in situations like these.
Not gonna lie, it's nice to be asked. 
/r/nocontext
Because it simply is 
I'm not crying, you're crying.
*Vegeta* is a better dad than Goku.
"That's what I was thinking too. Like his thought process is ""The fuck am I supposed to do with this?"""
Demonstrate Value
Ugh you‚Äôre so right 
This guy dads
Also probably didn't want to push too hard and lose a finger.
How did someone break their foot in the kitchen?
That would suck and not really be in the spirit of the show.  Would it really mean she was not the better chef just because she couldn't get a jar open even after wasting a considerable amount of time fighting with what was apparently an over sealed lid?  I'm no chef though, so maybe getting these things open does require some sort of skill they should all possess. 
Uh oh -Stress
Now get this lid off 
It was basically just a bumpy plate because I was 5, but yes.
V...Very (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)
Very much yes it can be proven as such that a man or women of great capabilities in which it is a possibility to cry with such strong emotion. Let it be so.
Piccolo is a better dad than Vegeta 
"Keep it. Then produce it as evidence during arguments.   ""C'mon dad, let me borrow the caaar! You never do anything for me!""    ""Oh yeah? **LID.**""    ""...OK fine, I'll walk."""
Engage Physically
so, hows all that going?
You ok?
Choke me harder
Losing a finger during a cooking competition is generally frowned upon in Chef Culture.
Correction: She actually broke her toe, not foot*   If I recall correctly she broke it outside the show. They‚Äôre allowed to go home after the shooting for the day ends.  
A clay one that started to crumble and that you painted in obnoxious colours yet your dad still said he loved it?  I‚Äôve got one of those too
OwO
Piccolo and gohan are living proof that sometimes beating a child is the best way to teach them
Goku is basically a child who just wants to fight all the time instead of do anything like provide for his family or make sure his children study. He has rich friends and won some money once, if it wasn‚Äôt for that they‚Äôd be destitute.   Piccolo basically raised Gohan and made him the man he is today.   Vegetta on the other hand is an asshole but actually trains his son how to be a noble Saiyan and loves his daughter. He secretly loves his family but is too proud to show it.

"I remember awhile back I was at the grocery store, and this kid was trying to buy some goodies and a teddy bear for his gf. He did not have enough money and was heartbroken. The cashier just told him ""Go ahead, I got the rest"" and his face lit up. He thanked her at least 5 times, and was beaming from ear to ear, while telling his friend how nice the lady was. It is nice to see there are people, no matter what age, who can appreciate a beautiful gesture, and take it to heart."
Once when I was going for a walk I found a kids wallet...fairly young judging by the writing. He had written his address in it, and it had about 80cents in it. So I put $10 in it and stuck it in his mailbox. Makes me smile imagining his surprise when he got it back.  
The kid saying Thank You at the end is the best part :)
Little dude in the back is digging hard in his ass. Still a nice video.
Is... Is the house talking to me? 
You absolutely wonderful human beings. It‚Äôd be easy to just think this is as a small thing... but 3 kids decided to stop playing because they saw something more important they needed to ‚Äúdeal with‚Äù. Their parents deserve praise for raising such good humans.
These kids were raised right
John Connor was a good kid.
Some good in the world. 
I was chaperoning a high school band competition a few years ago (yeah, I‚Äôm old) and I found a quiet restroom to take care of business. While I was in there a couple of band kids come in from a different school than ours. Here‚Äôs the conversation I overheard:    ‚ÄúHey, somebody left their sunglasses here.‚Äù    ‚ÄúWow, those look expensive.‚Äù    ‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs put them here on the counter where the owner can find them. Somebody‚Äôs missing these.‚Äù  Band kids are awesome. 
Whoever raised them, good job. 
This is my family‚Äôs front yard. That wallet the kid‚Äôs returning is my Brother‚Äôs. Crazy to run across this just lurkin around Reddit.
What was extra is that kid with helmet trying to get his pants out off his cheeks.
Fucking wholesome I love it. 
What really sucks is If you work at Walmart as a cashier you can‚Äôt pay for people‚Äôs groceries.  Edit: Wow, didn‚Äôt expect to get this many upvotes. Never happened before.
This happened to me. I was behind a teenage girl who had a small bouquet of flowers. The total came up a few dollars more than she had.   She apologized and turned to walk away. I spoke up and asked her if they were for a special occasion. She replied they were for her mom‚Äôs birthday. I asked the cashier to just ring them up with my order and told the girl to take her mom some flowers.   Her eyes teared up and she ran over and gave me a big hug. That was awkward but I felt good about the situation 
I tried to do that once when I was working at the desert stand at a ballpark. The girls were sad because they couldn‚Äôt afford enough cones for everyone so I just gave them my employee discount.   Then the little shits ran back to their parents and can back with enough money for cones and lemonade all around. I never did it again.
That's nearly as sweet as this video.
I once found 20$ in the snow and got in trouble with my parents because they though I was getting into some illegal activity and making money that way.   Imagine his mother opening his wallet and questioning where he got it from.  Man my parents were crazy.
I know that's what I thought! They did a good deed AND said thank you cause their just so friggin polite. 
That made my heart melt! His parents are good people, raising good kids‚ô°
Common decency... like it‚Äôs 1992 or something 
Smart house
The sooner you learn that doing something nice for someone else without personal gain can be one of the best feelings the better.
I feel people are not appreciating their parents enough. It's a result of some really good and hard work by some parents. 
\*slips $5\* don't tell anyone
Damn, that is awesome! Reminds me of a chopped episode. The winner gets 10k, and blah blah. Anyway one of the girls competing said she needed the money to go see her sick mom in italy, or wherever she lived. She ended up coming in second, which pays no money. The dude who wins tells her to take the money and go see her mom one last time. Fucking righteous display of humanity.
Raised right! 
I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôd call thanking someone for returning *their* wallet common decency so much as it‚Äôs just a young kid frazzled by a weird speaking door video recorder and having a brain fart lol.
Always cut the net out of little boys‚Äô bathing suits
Yea cause I want my house announcing to people I'm not there...
When I worked at Walmart someone was literally 15 cents short and I just said whatever, threw in what they had and closed the drawer. The tills are out or over at the end of the night by a couple bucks here and there anyways so it evens out. Corporate Walmart can afford that. I wasn't going to tell them they couldn't have an item because they were pennies short. 
#fight capitalism#
You are always being watched randomly by asset protection and also if you do it for someone out of your heart, there will always be a a****** who will be like ‚Äú why can‚Äôt you pay for me‚Äù and then complain and make a ruckus. 
What's the ratio of shrute bucks to Stanley nickels?
Possible but they probably would've said sorry too
FBI open up!
One time the waves at the beach were pretty rough, so a bunch of sand and little rocks were getting churned up and getting caught in the net in my suit. I was in the water for a few hours and when I got out my little dick was covered in scratches. Some teeny tiny sand pieces even cut the inside of my dickhole. Ruined my summer. 
I mean it's also announcing that they're on camera, soooo
I owed one cent and the cashier wouldn't let me get the item. But i understood where i was and apologized, went to my car, grabbed a penny, waited in line and got my shit again. It sucked. But it happens. So when i was  behind a box I'd help out when i could. 
43 beets.
You‚Äôll never take me alive!!
People still rob grocery stores though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
That cashier can fuck right off
You can get fired for being short, because it normally means you're not counting change right. I don't like the idea of someone not getting their groceries because of a penny but can't just blame the cashier. If they were a dick about it, yes they can fuck right off.
Man, I am so glad I'm in Canada. We got rid of our penny, so my till will literally never be perfect anyway, but it's much less stress.  That said, long as we're within range by $3, it's fine. My managers keep a jar of change to even it up anyway.
Can we talk about how cozy that looks? Having such a big dog to cuddle 
There are zero monsters under that bed.
I love how the pup takes over majority of the bed and the little girl gets a sliver of it.  What a sweetheart.
I did this to my dog once and she loved it.   She loved it so much she won't sleep any other way. I get woken up every night when she tries to force her big dumb head under my duvet.    I can't stop her though, she's too damn cute. 
I wanna be reincarnated as that kid's next dog
It‚Äôs sweet how much effort she has to put in to do that 
She did a piss poor tucking in job 
I have two dogs and two kids. Neither dog will sleep with them. I thinks it's because they try to play with the dogs and my dogs are lazy.
I approve 
I don‚Äôt know how likely a mauling is but there is a high risk of suffocation. 
"And commence with all the people with their anecdotal bullshit stories about how their pitbulls are ""so sweet."" Yeah, they're super sweet until they maul a child. "
She got her priorities straight
Really cute! But unpopular opinion, that is so unsanitary... 
So. Many. Tucks.
Typical dog takin up the whole bed 
You‚Äôre never too old to tuck your dog into bed. I‚Äôm still in my teens and you better bet I bundle him into a burrito 
Imagine how large that dog seems to her.  That dog is much larger than she is   That‚Äôs so awesome
"I sleep between a great Dane mix (always my little spoon, under the covers with me) and a German shepherd. 5'4"" lady with 185 lbs of dog. Can confirm it is 12/10 cozy. "
Doesn't matter when you got a big boy like that to protect you
Exactly what my dog does when I let her in my bed. I end up getting squeezed and can't move my dog since she goes to sleep, and by dog law, I can't move a dog while they are asleep.
Classic case of blanket addiction. It's worse than couch addiction, lol. 
As long as your cool with getting a doggie makeover too. 
you‚Äôre on waiting list
it's undoubtedly adorable but so frustrating to see how badly she does it
You get what you pay for in child labor. 
It was so frustrating to watch. Adorable though.
This genuinely made me laugh, I‚Äôd give you gold if I could afford it
Thanks, u/DoIApprove
My doctor made me get a dog for my kid because I was sanitizing everything so much. She said if you don‚Äôt want your kid to end up in a bubble get her a dog and throw away your hand sanitizer. She‚Äôs a really healthy kid now. So it is unsanitary but in a helpful way!
I know, kids are so filthy. 
Do you think that, as your older dog did, the current dog might also become crankier or develop less of a tolerance as it grew older?
Now just imagine if her dog was a genuine giant like a Tibetan Mastiff.
Exactly.
I do that with my cat even though he's small enough to easily be moved. I sleep in weird positions so the lazy little shit won't be bothered.    Though it takes a lot to bother him. I've lifted him up with both legs in bed and he either didn't care or didn't wake up
Hopefully dog law isn‚Äôt as complicated as bird law. 
Duh.  That's the best part.  Next you'll be threatening us with sleeping in the sun belly up.
And a watchlist 
She really isn‚Äôt very good at it at all. 
That's how I feel about every single thing my toddler attempts to do by himself. 
Exactly! My dogs are basically like, fuck you guys, we're sleeping on the couch where we won't get distubed.
I didnt even think of that. Im pregnant now and Ive been super anal about sanitizing EVERYTHING. I guess I have to let go a bit! Thanks for the lesson ! 
The canine version of a lion
And now I'm thinking of Mouse from the Dresden Files.
Bird law in this country is not ruled by reason
The worst part is, you get to have fun all day for the rest of your life*!
She's doing her best and that's what counts
Pets and dirt are the best things for (most) kids immune systems. 
You were definitely on the wrong track:  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171106132018.htm  Maintain and teach basic hygiene, but once your kid can crawl, let it play in the dirt, let it touch things that aren't clean, bring it in contact with other kids and with animals.
Kids raised with pets in the home have fewer allergies (according to at least one study).
Well, they were bred to confront tigers after all.
It counts for something but if I really needed to be tucked in I would probably hire someone else

"Just learned his name was Lonnie Johnson so I looked him up on wikipedia.   Found out we have the same birthday, are from the same state, grew up a few hours away from each other, and that he apparently ""almost burned his house down making rocket fuel"" as a child. lol TIL   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Johnson_(inventor)"

He seems like a very nice guy.
Dude has a Masters in Nuclear Engineering, was a rocket scientist for NASA... but makes millions in royalties from creating a squirt gun and then deciding to replace the water with foam darts to create a whole new successful toy... Man is just bad-ass, we need more people like him in this world!

what a hero.  I hope it made him rich.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn he just got hourly wage for creating it though.
I was able to interview him for a robotics tournament in the South East. I can say he truly is an incredible man... he inspired me to push myself further in all my classes as well as on my robotics team. Overall great guy and I am so glad I got to meet him!

Reminds me of a time when my dad told my sister and I ‚Äúwhoever can run and get me a beer the fastest is the kid I‚Äôm keeping‚Äù   I sure do miss my sister sometimes
Poor Mom sitting in the toilet taking a dump would never know what's coming for her üòÇ
We also used to run towards the house but only because our parents were gonna kick our asses for misbehaving at the supermarket.
Ah, the ‚ÄúYOUR turn to parent, wife‚Äù trick!
That's also a good trick to get your kids inside the house or to get them away from traffic on the street etc... My daughter never wants to go inside the house when we get home so I speak from experience haha...üòÇ
Me and my sister would also do that and its fun and everything until you run into your mom at full speed knocking her over. Hit her head pretty bad :(
So did you run towards her too, and seize the moment, for the future?
I'm sure she was fine with your father. How did your life go on the streets? 
Dad probably knew and would find it hilarious 
I see they didn't make you carry all the bags then. Lucky!
Oh 100%. That‚Äôs a ‚ÄúI love you so much but omg I‚Äôm so done with you all‚Äù move
"The ""I Just spent 4 hours running errands with three kids and need a moment to feel like a person again"""
"Yeah. This is wholesome, but the point is just to get the kids inside the house quickly without them dicking around. My daughter will spend half an hour picking rocks in the driveway (which is fine, but not when you have to get inside and start dinner), but just saying ""*I bet you can't beat me inside!*"" really puts a fire under her ass."
You gotta stop once you're in your thirties.
Lmfao  This is funny and I'm gonna do it sometime soon.  I just started not letting my son win things all the time, and omg is he salty as fuck about it. I've created a sore loser for sure.  Nothing was funnier than the look on his face the first time I did it. Basketball, next shot wins. He slowly double dribbles and travels around the corner, his signature move, lines up his shot, and I stuffed the motherfucker back down his throat like it was walk on day and I had something to prove.  He just stood there kinda dumb founded while I grabbed the ball and unnecessarily jumped to dunk the shit out of the 3' hoop and end the game.

I'm sitting here with two shitty brown eyes and this kid gets a green one AND a blue one AND a cat with the same eyes?!
Wow.  These are both fairly rare conditions.  (Cleft lip I think is not rare in some 3rd world countries - but international health is really only a hobby ... so).  Are these conditions connected in some way?

This is how i look when i take off my bra.
Because Reddit is like a pond full of piranhas. One bites you and it's all nom, nom, nom from that moment on. 
I don't think anyone wants to miss the birth of their child..... Sounds like a shit question lol
I love how he was genuinely confused that someone would even ask that question.
It's so refreshing to hear this coach put things into perspective.  Well done!
What a fucking legend. That's the backup you need as a player! Or rather as any person having a friend/trainer/boss/whatever like that is the best.
I‚Äôve seen this before and I always think that the player is going to work so much harder when he gets back. I requested 3 days from work for the birth of my son and saw that I had been approved for a week instead. When I asked, my boss said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre having a kid. You‚Äôre taking a week.‚Äù That‚Äôs how you make people work for you.
His demeanor and facial expressions are amazing and on point, even watching without sound.
"Seen this on another subreddit before. His name is Sarunas Jasikevicius. I took a class with him at Maryland in the 90s called ""Theory of Coaching"". He was less animated back then but you could tell he ""got it""."
Before my dad had me he used to get so pissed off at his friends who'd cancel/say no to plans with the boys just to stay home with their kids instead. He even had a fight with one friend who said the same thing to him: say that again after you've had kids. A few years later he met my mom and had me, and went to that friend and was like yeah... I get it. :)
He's got it straight... kudos to the coach
Link to source video with audio https://youtu.be/-qqDIqlGUFE
I thought it was about to take a turn on ‚Äúhe is now in heaven...‚Äù. Ohhhh, metaphor. Phew.
He leaves his job to be with his wife and child. That should be the norm, not the exception.
Tons of people criticize players for missing games even early in the season.
The journalist considers that the semi-final is more important than that. There are plenty of people like that, by the way. Work and money over family, always.
Reporters are sometimes more interested in the reaction than the answer.
‚ÄúWhat do I think about it? I allowed him to go.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIs it normal for someone to leave during Semi-Finals?‚Äù  **Visible confusion** ‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Äù
Happy cake day !
The JayLenoFly agrees!
Yeah he is a good coach. Any Lithuanians here?
I get what you mean but even a week is so depressingly little.
Same here. My coworkers too. I thought they'd be annoyed about picking up the slack, but they were all just genuinely happy for me and full of great advice.
How the honesty of his emotion just radiates through.
Yeah but missing a game because of the birth of your own child is pretty understandable and if you get mad at a player for that you are human garbage.
Actually seeing a little person who is half of you take their first breath outside the womb is in fact something to behold. If someone is never going to see a vagina the same way because it tore a little at birth then they may not be emotionally prepared to be a parent because that whole idea seems really absurd.
Aka most of the time
Stupid questions are the best questions a reporter can ask, people give the most honest examples of character to stupid questions.
*Ding dong ‚ô¨*    Who's that at the door?!  *Secretariat agrees!*
In the country this coach is from father normally gets a month of the paternity leave. And either of the parents gets 12 months, extendable to 24.
It is.
To be clear we don‚Äôt even have mandated maternity leave. When my wife had our kids her employer offered it, but many employers don‚Äôt and the government does not require it.  It‚Äôs just starting in some states. New York State added up to 8 weeks of maternity or paternity leave last year, but it‚Äôs only partially paid so many people can‚Äôt afford to take it.  The U.S. has a really odd lack of family values.
"I'll bet there are hundreds of Father's on reddit who missed the birth of a child because of work ""commitments""  Not because they wanted to go to work, but because they would have been fired if they hadn't gone in to work, and that's a very sad thought."
Hundreds? I'll bet the number is in the thousands in the United States alone, where maternity leave isn't even a guarantee, and paternity leave is laughed right out of any conversation about labor rights.
I was lucky to get 6 week unpaid leave. My husband got a new job, I now stay home. His new job gives him paid paternity leave for whenever we decide to have baby number 2. We‚Äôre thrilled that that‚Äôs their policy!
This isn‚Äôt true. You are very wrong. You must be full time, have been employed for a year, and the company must have at least 50 employees.   ‚ÄúEmployees are eligible for leave if they have worked for their employer at least 12 months, at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles. Whether an employee has worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined according to FLSA principles for determining compensable hours or work.‚Äù  One of my close friends was let go from her job after giving birth, and it was completely legal. The  company we worked for had 46 employees.
God the US is shit for normal people.
Yep yep you got it, go ahead....
This is the best way to settle it, and I wish more people would do this.
I commend him on his sportsmanship 
That‚Äôs pure cool. 
The smile in his face says it all, it's amazing
He points and nods his head like ‚Äúyup you got me, go ahead‚Äù
Its a modern day duel. That's pretty awesome.
Relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns2ibiuHCiU  Both those players always are the last to leave the ice after the pre-game skate.  Since they both can't be last, they play a little game.
I did this once my freshman year of college. Made my day. 
He must do this often since he has that strap wrapped around his wrist.
I find that doing rock paper scissors for things makes people so much less pissy than forcing someone to make a decision. We often do this at work when there's Charlie work to be done and 3 or 4 of us have to decide who will do it. If you do a vote someone gets mad. If you leave it up to the rpk gods, no one can be upset.   Edit: rps not rpk. Dumb dumb. 
A true Englishman!
Thanks for helping those of us who are blind and could not view the video. 
Yeah he‚Äôs clearly a pro and shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to participate in amateur events smh
 next time you have some Charlie work to do and you really want someone else to do it, spring the game of rock, paper scissors on them out of nowhere, and start counting down quick. Most of the time they'll go along and start the motion of the game and since you caught them off guard, they have no time to think and they keep their fist closed and play rock 8/10 times. That's a completely made up stat but i swear the strategy works . 
Smh my head
*Dude.*  The *entire* fire season of 2014, I went completely undefeated.   **Completely Undefeated**  I never turned down anyone, and everyone wanted to take down the king. It was improbably amazing.   I‚Äôve hardly played since. 
Shake my smhmh head
I know that I read a couple articles about the most used patterns, but I promptly forgot that shit. At least consciously.   I thought I was gonna call it good after the first few, but my subordinates always bragged me up, so I got challenged a lot.   Should have been a CEO.

Hey what's wrong with rimjobs  Edit: Ty for gold friend
there's another video about this guy that I saw here recently. In that video, he goes into parks and talks to homeless people and lets them know that there's food at his restaurant and they should come and have a meal. Truly a great man and I can't wait to eat at his restaurant when I go to DC.
I really, really, really hope people don't take as much advantage of this mans huge heart and kindness than I would expect. Bless his soul 
I‚Äôll definitely be eating here soon!  
My roommate and I order delivery from them, and the food is freaking awesome! The fact that he's a good guy makes it win-win (except for our waistlines).
## I shall pass this way but once; any good that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being; let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.  Edit (credit): Stephen Grellet (November 2, 1773 - November 16, 1855) was a prominent Quaker missionary
Well damn... did not expect morning feels. This dude...
All I gotta say is those are some fortunate homeless people being in that location because middle-eastern food is the bomb
Going to be in DC next week. Thanks for letting me know where I'm going to eat. 
I am trying to figure out how to upvote more than once
Quran says And they give (their own) food, in deep love of Allah, to the needy, the orphan and prisoner (out of sacrifice, despite their own desire and need for it),  (And say:) ‚ÄòWe are feeding you only to please Allah. We do not seek any recompense from you nor (wish for) any thanks.‚ñ∫{Surah Al- Insan Chapter 76: Verse 8-9}   Mentioned in Hadith  Abdullah ibn ‚ÄòAmr(Radiyallahu Anhu) said, ‚ÄúA man asked the Prophet(Peace be upon him), ‚ÄòWhich aspect of Islam is best?‚Äò  He said, ‚ÄòFEEDING PEOPLE and greeting those you know and those you do not know.'‚Äù‚ñ∫{Sahih Bukhari,Kitab Al-Iman,Hadith #12}  In a hadeeth reported by Abu Moosa Ash‚Äôari (Radiyallahu anhu), The Prophet (Peace be upon him) said ,‚ÄúFEED THE HUNGRY, visit the sick and free the captives‚Äù ‚ñ∫{ Narrated by Imam Bukhari }  Ibn ‚ÄòAbbas, may Allah be pleased with him reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,  ‚ÄúHe who eats to satisfaction while his neighbour is hungry is not a mumin.‚Äù ‚ñ∫{Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi,Al-Sunan Al-Kubra,Vol. 10,Pg.3,Hadith #19452}  He says, he is doing as worship to ALLAH May ALLAH bless him... Al·∏•amdulillƒÅh 
Give that man a freakin‚Äô public forum and let him spread the word. Lifting others up is what we should all be doing 
How is this even sustainable? I figured he'd have a line around the block with homeless people by now.  E: Getting a ton of the same responses below, so here:  *  The boxes are small and only cost 1-2 dollars considering he buys wholesale and cooks in bulk, so it's negligible  *  He would have thrown it out at the end of the day anyway, so it's 100% negligible  *  He is making more money than he is losing because of the extra business he gets from people hearing of his philanthropic deeds  *  He is a saint and living like a pauper because of it and just doesn't mind because he loves helping so much  *  ~~There aren't very many homeless people here because it's by the WH~~  *  It's meat and rice, thus dirt cheap and barely affects his costs if at all  E2: Getting a lot of notes that there are plenty of homeless around the WH, which *I fucking thought,* but I'm not from DC so I took other people's word for it. It's off the list!
He‚Äôs been doing this for years, he‚Äôs got it covered.  What a great person (soul).  Anecdote:  Louis IX (Saint Louis) did this every Sunday.  
I believe, as it seems he does and has shown, that the vast majority of people wouldn't abuse this. It's part of the lesson he's trying to impart.
100% me too, and I'll leave the biggest tip I ever have. I don't drive by dc often, maybe once a year.  But  next time I do I'm definitely eating there.  I think he deserves every kind of exposure possible. 
Also 16,000 meals worth of leftovers that don't get thrown out at the end of the day :) 
It's not Middle Eastern food. It's a Pakistani restaurant so South Asian (Pakistani) food.
Depends. If I had a choice between two places, one that charges $9 for a meal and isn't doing this, and one that charges $11 and is doing this, I'd go to the place for $11. If locals are aware of it, they're probably supportive.            Alternatively, the place is doing really well and he's got enough of a profit margin to eat into.             My worry would be that he's got no profit margin because of it, and is spending everything to sustain the business, pay his staff, and forgoing the ability to grow/pay for anything past his base needs. In which case, he should set up a Patreon or something similar. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would be happy to give a few dollars a month to help him continue what he's doing.
During lunch, they have a buffet, I think it‚Äôs like $15 or $20, all you can eat.  Their food is amazing.  Source: I‚Äôve been here twice for company lunches. 
I think it's well within his profit margin. With restaurants not being ~~able~~ *willing* to donate leftover food at the end of the day, this is a good way around it.  My main concern is him being able to sustain the practice once this goes viral. Hopefully he will get more paying business because of it, and I'm sure that he will.  Edit: Restaurants and grocery stores are protected by the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act against being sued if someone gets sick. In my personal experience, a lot of business owners I've talked to are not aware of this or are using ignorance as an excuse for the main reason they don't donate: **It's a logistical issue they don't want to spend time or resources dealing with it when they can just throw it out.** Which is truly unfortunate. 
It also looks like a small portion he's giving away, looks like a small salad box, so it's not like he's giving massive portions.   A lot of food probably goes to waste by the end of the week so I don't think it's eating that much into his margins. 
America's hunger and homeless problems are all artificial. We have so much cheap food wasted. We have more empty houses than we do homeless people. The problem is not being solved because we don't want to solve it.   (and since I came to the states a decade ago, I noticed that the culture tends to hate and look down on homeless people rather than pity them, which was a shock).
That's pretty awesome.  Pros mark their balls so it is basically handing the kid an autograph as well.
That face though. Pure joy right there
I once had a customer-service job in retail store and met a man named John who was in his 90s, and a frequent customer. He was always very kind and stopped to chat when he would see me working.   One day, quite randomly he asked ‚Äúdo you like golf?‚Äù to which I responded ‚Äúyes! I grew up next to a course a have been playing since I was a kid.‚Äù He lit up when I told him that and said ‚ÄúWonderful! I‚Äôll bring you some golf balls. I am to old to play anymore and I have lots of golf balls I don‚Äôt need.‚Äù I chuckled at the gesture and told him I looked forward to that, not really thinking he ever would.   Every day I saw him after that, he would pull a golf ball out of his pocket and hand it to me with a big smile. It always made my day. Mostly from seeing the joy it seemed to give him.   I saw his wife in the store one day without him, so I asked ‚Äúwhere is John today?‚Äù to which she  solemnly replied that he had just passed away only 2 days earlier.   I didn‚Äôt really know him well but I was very sad that he had passed. I went to his funeral visitation and left a golf ball at his casket.   Sometimes small gestures can leave a lasting impact and you don‚Äôt have to be a golf pro to make someone‚Äôs day.   Edit: to the kind stranger who gave me gold: Thank you, that small gesture made my day. 
I really wish I was famous so that the simplest thing I do could bring people the same amount of happiness that that kid had at that moment.
At first, I thought he gave him a tissue haha.
I had a similar experience when I was a kid at the 1996 Senior PGA Open. Arnold Palmer was playing and I really wanted to give him a high five. He walked over and shook my hand, and gave me a ball he was playing with. I was pretty elated, but we had a connection at the golf course and they asked if I wanted to get the ball signed by Arnold after the match.   Unfortunately, Arnold refused to sign the ball. He had signed a few items recently that had ended up on eBay, and he wasn't fond of people profiting off of his signature. Instead, he said I could hold onto the ball, and that he'd send me something special.  A few weeks later, I received a copy of his score-card, and a picture of him with a personal note that included my name (to make it special, and so I couldn't resell it easily) and a note of encouragement.   It was such a thoughtful gesture, and I'll always remember Arnold as a true gentleman, and one of the finest representatives of the sport that ever lived. I still have the picture, ball, and score card hanging on my wall back home.  
He‚Äôs going to have that for life... until some hateful harlot he married wins it in the divorce. It‚Äôs not even that valuable, she just knows how much it means to him. She‚Äôll eventually send it back to him, crushed and burned, with a note saying she‚Äôs moving to Barbados to be the fuck toy of some Arabian Prince. 
It's like watching a kid see a magic trick, he's so surprised/happy. Anybody know who that golf pro is?   Edit: It's Rory McIlroy. That was cool of him.
Took a friend to a baseball game back in like middle school. He didn't even play the game, but out of our entire group, he was the kid that got a bat.  Oh, then he got another one the next time we went.
It's not much for Rory McIlroy, but it's something this kid will remember his entire life  
Seems wrong for a grown man to give his balls to a child. LOL!
Pure happiness.
I wish I would have had one of these moments as a kid before I became so cold and jaded. That was in my teens and 20‚Äôs though.   Now in my 30‚Äôs I think I am coming back around and things like this actually bring me joy.  Edit: The consensus I think is that these moments are rarer than you think.
What a beautiful story. Thank you for sharing! I can only imagine the joy it gave John as well, sharing his passion with you.
"That's so sweet! When I was in grad school I spent some time volunteering at a local nature trail. Just sat in the cabin, greeted people, sold souvenirs, etc. There was a sweet old man who came to walk all the time. His wife was suffering from some kind of dementia in her old age; but he said the one thing she liked to do was read a lot of books. He often saw me reading while I was working and offered to bring me some books his wife was done with. The next time I came in, there was a large paper bag inside the cabin with ""To Snowbank_Lake, From Buster"" written on it (he had come by during someone else's shift and left it with them). The bag was full of romance novels! lol. He had no idea that was what they were. Next time he saw me he said ""Yeah, there's a western in there... "" (referring to a romance novel that takes place in Texas and therefor has a cowboy-looking guy on the cover). I actually did read a few of them. But it warmed my heart to picture this sweet older man with his cane walking to the trail with this bag of books for me."
You can.  Take 2 minutes after consuming content of some sort (YouTube, minor Facebook scrolling, a Reddit comment, whatever) and send the person a private message letting them know you were thinking of them and you appreciate something about their existence.    In the age of digital, communication has become much more easy but for some reason the simple act of saying hello to a random person you haven't talked to in awhile has been thrown away.  A long time ago, I had a pen pal and I'd hear from them every 2-3 months.  For some reason I thought as the internet grew, I'd have dozens of pen pals.  What I ended up having was a series of lives to consume without adding value.  I decided awhile ago to break down the consumption without value and write tiny notes.    Have a great day, stranger and if you'd like, you can start sending little notes of joy to those you encounter in your digital travels.
Right? This is what sports is really about. Making these kind of moments. Some people don't understand that. 
Shit I've been giggling intermittently thinking what if that was actually a wad of tissue.  Thanks!!
Anything you want to get off your chest friend?

"One, sports fans hate ESPN. Which is why it is dying off minus its live games they carry. Two do you even know why sports fans are sports fans? It is rarely for ""macho"" reasons. Some of us like the tracking statics and making predictions (which are always wrong). Some of us like our city and take pride in it. Some of us played the sport and want to see the best of the best plays, similar to why so many people what esports. A lot of us enjoy the shit talk, it is fun to come up with quips, and cut down those who quipped against you after their team loses. See what you are talking about is what you view of sports. "

Nothing more romantic than screeching kids in the background :D   But tbh, this is really cute. Most kids at my former school would have laughed and would have tried to ruin the moment. This is really sth, especially if both of them are teachers. I wish them all the best :)
This reminds me of my teachers back in high school! Our class set up our English teacher and the history teacher / football coach on a date. It started as kind of a joke because they were the only two younger, single teachers in a very small town. But it must have worked, because they are now married with two adorable kids, and when I look back on it, I get all the feels. Wish these two teaching lovebirds the best!
Loved this.  Although you would have to be pretty sure she would say yes.
What an awesome and enthusiastic audience!!!
I usually don‚Äôt like a public proposal, but this was pretty sweet.
This is the cutest thing ever. When these kids graduate high school and are looking back on their best memories at school, witnessing the engagement of their teachers is going to be on the list for many of them.
"My 6th grade math and social studies teachers has a very similar engagement during our 6th grade commencement ceremony. Rumors head been circling for months whether they were dating but the teachers (for obvious reasons) never clarified or addressed them. She didnt even know he had gotten on one knee until we all started ""aww-ing"" (she was sitting in front of the microphone where he spoke). This video is so much like that moment, it's uncanny."
‚ÄúMrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.‚Äù
Big PP Gym Teacher Energy right there homeboy
Seriously. You can actually hear the kids shushing each other right before the proposal. No one in that room was going to be ruining that moment.
This was a great idea for a number of reasons, but I suspect some thought went into showing kids a healthy, happy life moment.   This would have gone a long way in helping me develop had I seen it as a child. The only male-female romantic relationship I really knew consisted of fear and abuse. It's very confusing to be isolated as a child and to only see a corrupt, horrific marriage based on hate, control, and terror. I didn't understand how life was supposed to work at all.   I had nice teachers, but I never saw them in their own lives. I just saw the outer-world presentation.  My family had masks for the outer world too, so I had trouble reconciling real people and their public identities, which I thought were 100% fake.   Why the fuck am I telling you people this? I guess I'm encouraging teachers to let their students see them as real human beings.
I want that McDonald‚Äôs play area hype squad when I get engaged.
Kids at my school would‚Äôve turned Ms. Barker out.
That's probably the most adorable story I've ever heard. Literally everyone walks away from that story feeling good about themselves.
You didn‚Äôt go to a good high school if your history teacher didn‚Äôt coach something.
Most proposals are arranged so that the timing is a surprise, but not the question itself
If she said no.... I feel like theres a comp for this on youtube....
They are screaming from excitement
She can‚Äôt say no, you know... Because of the implication.
[r/kidsaresometimesnotfuckingstupid](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
Except the Science teacher who had a crush on the history teacher and football coach and their getting married was a double blow to his already somber and lonesome life
My US History teacher coached debate and mock UN. Does that count?  He also won NYS teacher of the year like nine times, so I feel like it does.
I don‚Äôt know if most are arranged, but I‚Äôd say at least 99% of the good ones are!
You're waiting for someone to post a link huh? Because you don't wanna open the YouTube app and search, then copy the link and come back to this thread and post the link, only to get like 5 upvotes, huh?  Me too buddy. Me too.
I expected that to be a /r/subsifellfor. Glad I was wrong. Subbed.
But good news! He isn't lonely and sad anymore because he killed himself.
"Maybe ""arranged"" isn't the word. Just that most responsible couples have the marriage discussion at some point, as well as the kids and other discussions."
You sons of bitches!
The guy below is wrong. *You* are the worst kind of person.
Yup, you don't ask to marry your SO unless you have already have got the OK from them at some point
Just when you think you can‚Äôt be got.
It's a tag-team con! Fuck!
Ah. My first victim.
They played us like a damn fiddle
Just a heads up for anyone that cares about checking into the ethics behind something before unabashedly fawning over it: with pituitary dwarfism, this dog is looking at a drastically shortened lifespan (often 5 years tops), and daily medications (primarily attempts at hormone replacement) to help alleviate some of the problematic side effects of their condition. So it‚Äôs not a benign condition in the least.   It‚Äôs caused by a recessive gene, so can pop up unexpectedly. But any responsible breeder needs to spay the dog that produces any pituitary dwarves and ensure the puppies from the litter are speutered as well, because even the normal looking ones can be carriers.   It seems like many breeders haven‚Äôt been willing to take these types of measures though, and dwarves are born more often than one would assume. You don‚Äôt see many out in the world as adults because they are often humanely euthanized due to the immense amount of vet care they require to live somewhat comfortably with their condition.   It goes without saying that breeding them on purpose or wishing that someone would breed them on purpose is not ethical. If someone is dead set on a small fluffy pointy eared creature, then they should just get a Pomsky or some other type of ‚Äúlesser evil.‚Äù  ETA: no shade @ the owner of the dog. Last paragraph is directed at any people who like the look of this dog but wouldn‚Äôt want to support animal suffering by actively seeking out (i.e. creating a demand for) a pituitary dwarf canine.
Do not breed this dog.
Get another German Shepard, name him Dr. Fleevil and call this one Mini Me.
He's very cute but I hope he doesn't have many health problems.
Can you imagine his life among other shepherds? I feel sorry for this cute little boy
ty for the context. also: am using speutered from now on.
No kidding. Healthy GSD already have enough joint problems.
Can I just give it pets and treats?
>Fleavil
My family had a dwarf German Shepard and while he didn't have many health problems initially, he developed them later on and only lived about 5 years. He was an amazing dog though.
What‚Äôs that?
Would the joint problems be better or worse with the smaller size and lesser weight?
Yes. Just don't breed with it.
Combination of spayed + neutered bc I‚Äôm too lazy to type both
Dramatically worse. Dwarfism is brutal on joint development.
definitely dont breed WITH it
The word you're looking for is portmanteau.
Portmanspeuter
Bad genetics, breeding within the same family of the breed like pedigrees...Like the Royal family (excluding Harry and William of course, they decided hooking up with a cousin wasn't cool).
Purebreds are inbred, which causes genetic issues, typically with joints/breathing and the likes.  Dwarfism is another, non-inbred, genetic issue that can cause joint issues.  Coupled together you've got compounding issues.
"this is my girlfriend and me. the video is like 3-4 years old. she gets startled because i lived 2 hours away from her so she was like ""what the fuck!"" when i would arrive. these videos are shot months apart and we were planning on hanging those days anyways, i would just show up earlier while she was still working to mess with her. she got a kick out of it. we‚Äôre still happily together. just got back from a fun trip in LA   thanks again for the share!  edit: [here‚Äôs a recent video of me scaring her a bunch with my old trumpet](https://youtu.be/eEeuygaSsS0) "
Maybe she‚Äôs so surprised because he‚Äôs actually a random stranger. 
I relate to this so hard! Friends/coworkers have started to catch on to how jumpy I am, and will use very soft tones to let me know that they‚Äôre there/approaching me. I still get startled almost every time lol  Edit: It helps to note, I don‚Äôt hear very well. And thank you for the therapy suggestions, but I think I‚Äôll live to jump another day. 
She's jittery... Hmmm maybe too much coffee is being offered to her ? 
She seems startled in all the encounters. I feel like we're missing out on a huge part of it by not having sound. Why not post the video?
She is absolutely gorgeous 
Isn‚Äôt this the same guy that scared his gf in the car by yelling?
Same girl from [this vine](https://youtu.be/HiQCPP5Dhbo)
When she reaches and grabs his hand in that last clip <3 This is adorable
How did you show up like 20 minutes after this video was posted in some random subreddit?  Edit: couple of people have suggested this whole thing is probably a setup to promote dude's twitch account. Since the imgur post doesn't link back here and the chance of him finding it on this sub a few (14!) minutes after it was posted are slim to say the least, the only thing that makes sense is either OP messaged him after he posted it (which really makes no sense), or it was prearranged to get people onto his twitch.  Not that I'm saying there's anything wrong with that. It is what it is.   Edit2: apparently the twitch link has been removed at mods request. 
I like the way she always smiles at you. Hope you're still smiling together üòÄ
hi chris
The best one was when she was looking right at you the whole time.  *toot*  *jumps*
Dude I'm sorry to tell, but I think she might just be really afraid of you
Your girlfriend has the cutest smile.
Or, it could be because [he does this all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejGXQx4NW8k)
"I used to work in a factory on the graveyard shift with only one other guy (his job was to make sure the automated part of the factory kept working and mine was to make sure it didn't burn down, get robbed and do first aid if necessary). Occasionally I'd have to go to his area and check that he's alive and I learned very early that he scares easily. So everytime I'd go and check on him I'd sneak in (which wasn't hard since the machines are loud) and I'd grab him! He'd scream and we'd have a good laugh about it. Even though I always did these ""life checks"" every hour on the hour he never got used to my scare strategy. "
I came here to suggest maybe not so much caffeine too, lol
https://youtu.be/IVhOqwxoJNg  This shit was too cute to not go find the video. Looks like there might be more on the channel too. 
We have the technology for audio and we have the technology for video, we're just not there yet in combing the two, one day maybe 
Honestly, BOTH of them are absolutely gorgeous
Well yeah, but her reactions are so adorable
Dat smile
Idk why but I like this vine a lot. 
OMG, she's the chicken girl?!
it was trending on imgur so i went on reddit to find the original post.  edit: i can see why people would think that but it's 100% not true. this specific video has been shared so many fucking times all over the place. imgur, ifunny, youtube, reddit, instagram on every meme account. i figured everyone had seen it by now. it's gone viral on reddit several times over the past few years. someone reached out to my girlfriend that the gif was trending on imgur. we checked it out and saw it was doing well. i figured there was probably a reddit post since that's how it has always worked out. i've been on reddit for over 8 years so this isn't really new to me. i saw it was on /r/funny and /r/mademesmile (i had no idea made me smile was even a subreddit)  so i tossed a comment on it not expecting much since it didn't really have any upvotes. 30 minutes later i started to see it growing....a lot. that's when i did some edits and added the youtube link to another recent scare video and my twitch because i was going live tonight anyways and figured if anyone wanted to talk live about my videos etc. they could.  i def have no idea who the OP of this post is....as well as the person who turned my video into a gif with subtitles.  
we are!
I think she might be a cat.
She killed him in that last one. He's dead now.
/u/fattehboi   you two are literally the cutest non-animal thing i‚Äôve ever seen.
Your job was to check and see if one other person was alive?
That one with the severely delayed reaction is my favorite. Thanks for the video!
You've been watching, and then later listening, to too much Star Trek my friend. It's science fantasy my dude.
Huh - [the video was posted on imgur](https://imgur.com/rxvW2S0) six hours ago - apparently OP saw it about five hours later and posted it here.  Ah, OP has almost 2 million karma from taking whatever's trending on imgur and reposting it on reddit. Not that I'm calling pitchforks, just thought it was interesting.   Edit: Hold up, you showed up ~~twenty~~ 14 minutes after it got posted here? How would you even find it? Seems unlikely. As a few people have pointed out, seems like this thread was set up for you to promote your twitch account. **Not that there's anything wrong with that**, interesting to see how advertising works on reddit now.
Is she single?
She's soo cute. Her surprised face is adorable. I can see why you keep wanting to surprise her! Very very sweet of you to show up like that.

Are you sure? [Check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOBpJQ2XDrQ)
It was part of it. We'd both have a sheet of paper that we have to give to the Health and Safety Officer in the morning that said we made visual contact every hour and the exact time contact was made. It was a chemical plant that produced highly toxic chemicals, some which could easily burn skin or kill a person if inhaled so the potential of him being seriously injured, incipacitated or killed was very real. 
I read a post from Chris that the delayed reactions are because he lived 2 hours away at the time, so she would initially be startled when someone approached her, and startled again when she realized it was him
The more surprising thing is that an imgur person knew that Reddit exists
Imgur was created by a redditor, the two sites are tied together in several ways. 
I'll ask her boyfriend.
Dude, you can't just ask a Lebanese guy if he's a fatteh.
O
Question about this. How is the interval between checks determined? It seems like some of the things in the factory are deadly enough that if you aren't there pretty much as it happens the guy is a goner. Shouldn't some of the activities that are particularly dangerous run on a buddy system instead? Also was the check more preventative i.e. you see them kind of tired and make sure they don't engage in the more dangerous activities or more reactive i.e. the company doesn't want a dead guy to not be found for a while?  I'm pretty curious about this from a logistical standpoint. If I'm totally off base with my understanding please let me know. Thanks!
"I feel like an employee at a retail store shouldn't be startled when someone approaches saying ""excuse me, but do you know...""  haha seems like something that would be expected in that environment"
Well the guy in this video was also a really popular Viner, so it's not that surprising. 
Imgur was literally created to host images for Reddit but okay 
Hey u/fattehboi, is she single?
X
The interval was more than likely determined so as not to be too inconvenient to us as we both had other duties to perform and an hour seems like enough time to allow me to do my other work and still check on him fairly regularly.  The more dangerous duties are done during the day, the guys that did this are all chemists and during the day there was a staff of about 20-30 depending on orders working in that part of the factory. Before the day guys would go home they'd make sure that all the major work was done and overnight the machines would mix, boil and do whatever else they did mostly automatically. The night guy would sit in the supervisors office and monitor all the computers that were displaying data on the operations of the machines, occasionally they required some service. Some of the 'settings' could be changed on the computer others would require him to go an manually open a depressurizatuon valve or other little nobs that needed adjusting. 90% of his job required no unusual safety procedures as anyone could do it without PPE. The other 10% was the dangerous part and required the mixing and adding of chemicals to facilitate the desired reaction. My office and his both had screens that displayed the cameras in the plant so I'd keep an eye on him and make sure to watch him closely when I saw him putting on a hazmat suit, knowing that's when I might need to help him. He also has a radio of course so he could contact me in an emergency. On nights when things were less busy, I facilitated the trucks and tankers that came to deliver or drop off product, I'd go and sit in their office and when I started working there I peppered them with questions about how everything worked because it was really very interesting.  The checks were certainly reactive. A depressing idea but thankfully none that anyone has ever had to run into. The administration overseeing labour related injuries has never been called for a death and the emergency eye wash and shower systems have only ever been turned on for tests.   The good news there has never been a lost time injury in the chemical processing division of the plant. It sounds unsafe but it really was a very safe place to work. The Health and Safety Officer was known to review overnight camera footage to make sure that everyone was following the rules and requests for additional safety equipment or measures were taken very seriously and acted upon quickly (policy was to take action no more than 30 days from the date the request was filed). 
Well, I work in a library and get approached by users all the time, yet I still startle almost always whenever someone goes and asks me something.   It even happens when I see someone approaching me and getting time to prepare for it, but the second they start to talk I jump, whyyyyy, it's so annoying...   My co-worker loves to scare me because I'm such an easy target :(
Stop whining Chris
Yeah and now Imgur has its own fucked community that hates Reddit. /r/ignorantimgur
Goodbye
And now reddit has its own sub that hates on imgur. The cycle continues. I like and use both. I don't see the problem. People just like to hate on something. 9gag is a cancerous hell hole though :D!
r/askouija is leaking
This guy is a local hero:  When he was a kid he had a major surgery, requiring a big donation of blood. Upon recovery, he made a vow to start donating blood as soon as he could (I think it was from 18 not 14 but doesn't matter).  After the first few donations, Doctors learned that his blood contained unusually strong and persistent antibodies against Rhesus Disease. Harrison has helped prevent thousands (millions?) of children from dying.   He has a world record for giving blood (or plasma), I'm not across the exact difference.  *Source: I wrote an article about him in high-school when trying to organise a school blood drive. This is my memory of the research I did.*
Hey cool, I have the same antibody! I have saved 11 cancer patients so far!
Now that he's no longer giving blood do they have a backup plan for the babies he was saving or has the given enough that they've got stock piles of it now for them?
r/humansbeingbros
So he's like a literal mutant superhero. What a guy. I'd buy this guy a pitcher, or in Australian, one beer.
I was one of them. Thank you kind sir
Damn 2 million babies
Fomer blood banker here. I used to issue the products that saved those babies every day. Here's a Wikipedia article about him for anyone who doesn't know: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harrison_%28blood_donor%29?wprov=sfla1  Definitely a hero!
Alright, now you gotta take his place
Hey random redditors reading this! Just so you know, you don‚Äôt need a rare blood mutation to help cancer patients through blood donations! Most people can donate blood platelets every week (but only up to a total of 26 times a year). They are used to help trauma patients, cancer patients and lots of other people.    Nothing is stopping you from being like these guys!  Edit - also you can totally drink right after donating platelets unlike regular whole blood donations, so feel free to schedule your appointment on weekend nights!   Edit2 - you can also donate whole blood every 8 weeks too. Donating one type of blood does not impact your ability to donate the other, usually.
He isnt the only source available but he is the best. Other donors have it naturally occurring too, but just not in such levels. I believe production can be artificially induced too  https://www.donateblood.com.au/anti-d-program
Rh- people can be deliberately injected with Rh+ red blood cells to induce them to produce that same anti-Rh antibody.  So we won't run out of sources.  The reason James Harrison made an anti-Rh antibody is probably because he was given Rh+ blood back when he needed so much blood when he was a kid.
If memory serves, plasma is able to be donated much more often than blood, and most (or maybe all?) of his donations are actually blood plasma.
The wiki he says he‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe man with the golden arm.‚Äù    Now that is a wicked nickname  Edit:  stupid autocorrect 
I‚Äôll get the chloroform
A real life superhero origin story. So cool.
I‚Äôd like to see a movie based on this!
This comment right here officer.
It would probably be pretty boring lol. 
You've just killed millions of babies, snitch. 
The movie's just a two hour montage of him giving blood.

Maybe one last, wistful look from across the street as the fire consumes the building and then it‚Äôs off to find a new hooman to train.
My cat wakes me up at 6 every morning and doesn't let me go back to sleep. Food and water's full. Box is clean. He just doesn't want me to sleep in
Stop im crying
if i should die before i wake,  i pray that heaven my soul will take  (...but if they don't, my dogs await -  they'll sneak me thru their doggie gate ;)

I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. We had to put our German Shepherd to sleep this past June and she was only four but she had a myriad of heath issues that just kept growing. This post hurt me a lot too. It‚Äôs just not fair, ya know? I wonder how many times I‚Äôve said that these past few months. I‚Äôm really sorry for your loss. üò¢‚ô•Ô∏è hopefully they‚Äôll meet us in some version of heaven/afterlife! 
Dog heaven and human heaven intersect 
Whenever I meet a person who says they've never had a dog, I just imagine the happiness when they finally have their own furry friend.  I've grown up with dogs, but as I've gotten older I've just appreciated the bond so much more.  They really are just balls of love and will never let you down.  They're awesome. 
So the last time I read this, I got to trying to see things from my dog's perspective.  I had an elaborate fantasy where my dog had a talk with the cat and got to say his goodbye so that the cat wouldn't be sad or worried when he didn't come back (spoiler alert, the cat looked for him for weeks). I even imagined the conversation they had and how he told the cat to take care of his humans.   This resulted in me sobbing at work so much that I had to close my office door and leave it closed for the rest of the day so no one would realize I was crying like a baby. Mourning the death of a dog is unlike any other grief I have experienced.  I felt cold for mourning his death harder than family members.  Then I reassure myself into thinking that this little dog was part of my everyday life.  He was completely dependent on me and loved me purely and simply.  A year later and it still stings like it just happened.
No. Oh god no
And never mind that noise you heard. 
100 puppies are waiting for me after death? Where do I sign up for death? 
Losing my dog was the toughest grief I've ever faced.  They are closer to us than we realize sometimes.

Seriously. He was addicted and struggling when he said shit like that. He‚Äôs cleaned up and anyone willing to look into it knows better.  
I follow John Mayer a lot. I have for years and now with all of his IG stuff, I feel it's so easy to see his content.  Having followed him closely for over a decade, its really highlighted **how silly it is to judge people for actions they've done in the past, and label them that forever.**   The dude is 41. He became a known artist in his early 20s and he said some stupid things around that time.  I simply can't imagine being judged for the rest of my life for something's I've said over ten years ago, and having that be my defining factor. 10 years ago, I was an idiot.                 Anyway, my point is, like most of us, the guy has gone through some life changing events in his life (which he's talked about) and he's acknowledged his stupidity and has changed a lot, as far as I can see. Th guy is an **an entirely** different person from 10-15 years ago. His music is a testament of that.  All I'm saying is, it'd be pretty shitty to forever be judged for something I said 10 years ago and nothing else matters.
"I don't like the whole ""have a personality"" type of thinking. I think everyone has a personality and a vast majority of, if not all people once you get to know them have a unique, enjoyable way of expressing themselves. The guy the previous poster mentioned that was incredibly boring and had zero sense of humor? That same guy could be incredibly exciting and intelligent to someone else. Personality is in a sense just as out of your control as your looks are, but being loving, being kind, etc are completely different from ""having a personality"". I think people that say certain others don't have a personality just fail to admit that there can be others that have different life journeys and different interests or ways of expressing themselves. "
TBH I think that's a bit of a misnomer, my BF is super hot (a few friends have mentioned it, it's not just through my love-lens, haha), and has a great personality.  My current housemate is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, she's also the most kind-hearted, empathetic and loveliest people I've ever met.  There's definitely people who are not conventionally attractive who have shit personalities, too. It's almost like there's billions of people all with different faces and personalities...
Man you got downvoted hard... I thought the sarcasm was obvious
So what you‚Äôre saying is sometimes things be like they is and sometimes they don‚Äôt?
You‚Äôre also not him, to be fair. People make mistakes and he owned up to it. I understand your* point of view, but I encourage you to have empathy. You‚Äôre a different person with a different life experience than he has. Y‚Äôall deal with shit differently.   Edit: your*
Whenever he's interviewed, he tends to mention he was a huge douchebag when he was younger. I'll give him a pass for owning up. 
There are plenty of unattractive people with nothing of interest to say, you just don‚Äôt see them on TV
Fantastic answer
It's simple.  It's true.  It's thoughtful.  It's compassionate.  And it doesn't alienate anyone from the discourse.  We need more people like Keanu in the world.

"""What do you think happens when we die?""    >!""I know that the ones who love us will miss us.""!<"
I'm glad I live in the world with this guy.
r/keanubeingawesome
My dad died literally hours ago. This wrecked me.
I honestly wish to model my approach to life, and the world in general, after him.   It's incredible that someone who has suffered as much loss as he has is able to display such authenticity, kindness and empathy for others as he seems to, especially when there aren't any cameras around.
This man is a god damn global treasure...  Edit:please excuse my ignorance
The Matrix taught him to dodge bullets well!
Made me cry.
Fantastic guy
He‚Äôs truly a simple man, with the biggest heart. He‚Äôs very humble. Everyone is equal to him, no one is better, he treats all the same. He will give you the last piece of clothing on his back if needed. Remember that year he was sitting outside having a beer with a homeless man, and they ate and talked for awhile. Just gold this man is! We need more people like him.
How is this guy so perfect?
the best part for me was that it wasn't a canned answer, this wasn't some scripted hallmark moment, this answer was genuinely produced by him on the spot.  this is a man to be emulated.
Well he‚Äôs immortal so he‚Äôll only miss you.
I thought about his late wife Immediately  Edit: late ex wife, my bad everyone
>!And when the dog we gift to them gets killed, they get triggered and go into assassin mode.!<
Thank you guys transcripting the video, love u
Sorry for your loss, man.
Dude, ur so unstable
I am 100% sure he can lift the mjolnir.
Pain. Going through lots of it, either kills you, beats you, or produces something beautiful and powerful, and present. I think he is at peace.
While I really want to believe you, this *is* television. There could have been a rehearsal, a script, or post-production editing. (Still a great answer though.)
I've seen the movies; he doesn't miss.
I'd never before put together how close that is too when he was working on the Matrix movies. I wonder if that's why his performance was a bit muted.
Or those of us somewhere who can‚Äôt listen with sound. I always appreciate these comments.
Did you just reply to your own comment with an insult?
I'm pretty sure he can wield both Thors weapon
For people that don't know:  * Keanu's father was essentially absent his entire childhood * His close/best friend River Phoenix died from an overdose when he was 23 * In 2000, him and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Syme buried their child, who was stillborn at 8 months * This proved to be too much for the couple to handle, and they broke up weeks later  * He remained close friends with the love of his life, but Jennifer died in a car accident 18 months later. They had brunch together the day before.  * His sister battled leukemia for nearly a decade in the 90s (Reeves donated a large sum of his Matrix earnings to children's hospitals and cancer research)
What I do believe is that Keanu had given this thought before and come up with the best response to a difficult question, rehearsed or not. I'll for sure be borrowing it and giving him credit.
Dude Keanu's best friend River Phoenix died when they were 23.  Then 6 years later he and his girlfriend's baby was still born at 8 months. 18 months later she was killed in a car accident.  The guy knows death, and is widely reported to be one of the most genuine and down to earth people in Hollywood.
I bet you a got a boyfriend
And yet I think it worked perfectly for his character.
Just watched The Matrix again for like the 1,000th time yesterday (it's on Netflix US) and it still holds as one of my top five all-time favorite movies. Keanu played the character so well.
Not to downplay that but Stormbreaker doesn't have the worthiness qualifier like Mjolnir does, just fyi.
Quoting from further down in the comments in case you missed it:  > * Keanu's father was essentially absent his entire childhood > * His close/best friend River Phoenix died from an overdose when he was 23 > * In 2000, him and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Syme buried their child, who was stillborn at 8 months > * This proved to be too much for the couple to handle, and they broke up weeks later  > * He remained close friends with the love of his life, but Jennifer died in a car accident 18 months later. They had brunch together the day before.  > * His sister battled leukemia for nearly a decade in the 90s (Reeves donated a large sum of his Matrix earnings to children's hospitals and cancer research)
Regardless if it was rehearsed or not, that was the most personal, thoughtful, nicest thing anyone could have said. The audience was genuinely shocked with how beautiful of an answer it was. It was genuine and nice to me. So I feel like that's all that matters at the end of the day.
I bet he doesn't kiss ya
"To me Keanu played the perfect flat ""everyman"" persona that anyone could insert themselves into. He's essentially in shock. He lived a ""life"" that was as real as a hologram, he was thrusted into a new dystopian world, he learned that humanity is essentially just a highly evolved computer program (""Whoa.""). I'm pretty sure you'd go either totally insane or become insulated and numbed."
It's probably heavy though.
"Thor did tell the guardians that they wouldn't be able to wield weapons like Stormbreaker though.  ""You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies would crumble as your minds collapsed into madness."""
Fair point.
Keanu is strong & worthy.
And sexy.
And the one
When I was a kid, I spilled hot chocolate on the bed at Grandma‚Äôs. Oh, I can still see the mess on the white sheet. I was so scared and ashamed. She wondered why I was crying. I said I thought she‚Äôd yell at me. I remember the sadness in her voice when she asked why in the world would she ever yell about a spilled drink. She helped me clean it up, and then... she made more.  Damn I miss her.
This is how to break the cycle :)
Boomers: ‚Äúkids need discipline!‚Äù  Same boomers: ‚Äúwhy do my adult children hate me?‚Äù  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Clearly shaming children messes them up, as evidenced by the fact that this woman decided to use plus signs every three words.
Took me a long time to stop reading the + symbol as ‚Äúplus‚Äù and realize she‚Äôs using it as ‚Äúand‚Äù.
Don't understand why someone would tell at an innocent child who has an accident, but I guess everyone has there flaws.
+
And win-win, she learns how to clean it up, so next time she can do it herself. It makes it easier on you in the long run.
This is how my parents have been my entire life, and I‚Äôm 17 almost. I‚Äôm insanely glad my parents are amazing, and I feel truly sorry for the people who have bad parents, they seem so common now, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine dealing with that, and the problems I already have.
A kind memory of your grandma. I remember being at a friend‚Äôs house once when I was 8-ish and she spilled an orange soda on her bed. Her mum went berserk, ripped the sheets off, yelled and screamed. I was so shocked and scared, having never seen that behaviour from my own loving, wonderful mother. That was a big eye-opener to different families.
That feeling cold dread running down your spine, your head tingling with anxiety and fear after making a little mess.. Who the fuck thinks shrieking at children for not having adult levels of hand eye coordination is good parenting??
One time I sat on an egg because I thought it would hatch a chicken.  It didn‚Äôt hatch a chicken, it just made a giant ass mess all over my grandma‚Äôs carpet... when I finally told her, in tears, she laughed at what I was trying to do and we cleaned it up together. Then she taught me about how eggs you buy at a store can‚Äôt make chickens.   My mom would have beat the shit out of me.
"My 1 year old just weed on the carpet the other day. My immediate reaction was to go ""OH, NAME!"" But only though instant panic about the carpet and frustration at myself for letting him run around naked for so long!  You could see his little face get immediately upset, so while cleaning it up I had to keep reassuring him that I wasn't angry at him at all. I don't want him to be in a situation like you were feeling like you might be yelled at. Those early experiences are so important for how they deal with events later in life."
I was raised in a house where fists and belts and swearing were discipline. It actually takes some work to disassociate from that and realize how harmful it is. I personally thought that‚Äôs how everyone was raised until my late teens/early 20s.   When my first nieces and nephews were born, my siblings and I had a talk about all the things that happened when we were kids, and we all decided that it would be better to never raise a hand to any of them. And so far they‚Äôve never experienced it. And they are good strong well behaved kids. Seeing that, my parents actually apologized to all of us a few years back saying that‚Äôs just how they knew how to do things. Times change, and cycles are only broken if people do the work.
"My shitty mom: ""I'm your mother, not your friend!""  Also my shitty mom: ""Why won't you hang out with me?"""
She's doing an equation let's be patient and wait for the solution.
This is a tweet, I think she was probably just conserving the character count?
Someone should tell her about the ampersand.
Excuse + pardon me but me + my dog + his toy would like to have a word + conversation of how you + dog have been shitting + on my yard
I had a situation where me and a friend ate some chocolate in the bed of the friend and made a little mess... the mother was not even screaming just at her, but also at me like : are you allowed to make such mess in your own home ?  And i just thought I am not allowed to eat in my bed so this would not happened.  I dunno your rules and its your daughters responsibility not mine.  We were like 8 yo
Sadly a lot of people.  Sheer panic took control whenever I fucked up and how to fix it before my mother found out... no solution? Well time for crying and intense anxiety building until you want to throw up and she discovers it. *Woo.*
Wow, I can‚Äôt believe your parents apologized to you. Mine are the kind to sweep it under the rug and never acknowledge it ever happened.  My oldest is 9 and I don‚Äôt even blink at some of the things he does, that I would have gotten my ass beat and grounded for. He sees my mom and thinks she‚Äôs this gentle old lady that wouldn‚Äôt harm a fly lol
My mother said this all the time. It was such a sweet moment for me when she asked me why we weren't friends on Facebook.
It definitely isn't a parent's job to be their kid's friend. But it also isn't a parent's job to be a tyrant. It's a parent's job to be a guide through life, and a positive role model. Teenagers will almost always hate their parents, but if the parent did a good job, even the teenagers will usually come around eventually.  Edit: In this thread, a ton of teens with very selective memories about how awful they were/are to their parents.
& is only one character though
Dear & God & No
"I sometimes jump and cringe when my neice does things that I would have been destroyed for. When she spills something I *still* freeze in terror for a second or so before I remember that *I* am the one who is expected to react now...not to be the recipient of a reaction. I never get angry about it, or even the least bit emotional...because it's not something which deserves such a response.   I often feel annoyed with my Mom if we're both watching the kid. I told the kiddo to chew with her mouth closed and my Mom said, ""just leave her to eat in peace!"" I was dumbfounded. I reminded my mother that if it were me, I would have already had a backhand to the teeth for chewing with my mouth open. She accused me of exaggerating."
"""You're my mother, not my friend."""
That's the worse right there--when they outright deny the abuse they inflicted.  My mom has done the same thing.  For awhile I was doubting my memories until my sister confirmed it happened.
"Not op, but I've denied my mother's friend requests on numerous occasions. She was always very critical of me when I was young and I have worked hard my whole adult life to remove her words of criticism and self doubt that I have been repeating in my own head for years.  So to get this far and then let her into my socials? No.  When she asked why, I told her exactly this. She responded by saying ""I can't believe you're that insecure that your own mother's words can effect you so much. Grow up."""
Honestly parental gaslighting is the fucking worst because you were so young that you genuinely think maybe you're remembering wrong. It's worse when they'll try to make it into a cutesy story that they tell everyone and it's like no the main part of that story was the fact that you went absolutely crazy over a normal thing a kid did.
The thing I notice the most, picture wise, is how white his teeth are. Google meth mouth--this guy was probably scared shitless of ending up with teeth like that and must take REALLY good care of them
Dr. MacDreamy 
  UAMS is where I went after having a car accident...the doctors there were amazing and the fact that they are teaching on the job a lot of the time means that you get doctors that want to find any and every possible answer!     I will say though, that one of my most embarrassing moments in life was laying on that table with a fractured back, tailbone, and various other injuries while a room full of beautiful women of our futures medical field watched as I had a finger shoved up my ass to ‚Äúcheck for internal bleeding‚Äù....at least that‚Äôs all he told me...and then didn‚Äôt even give me a three count or anything as if I was supposed to know that‚Äôs what the process consisted of...but yeah, great place!
‚ÄúNot everyone turns out like their parents. I mean look at me my parents were honest hard working people‚Äù  But seriously great job 
Straight male here...  ...he cute
Indeed, this made me smile.  
Well done! You have done what a lot can't, you broke the cycle. It takes a lot of strength and courage.   If you decide to have children, you have already given them the best chance of succeeding in life.   Your strength and courage will see you graduate in the future and become an integral part of society.   From a random internet stranger, I'm very proud of you. Keep fighting the good fight. 
My dad was a doctor, now I do meth .
My mom‚Äôs a violent alcoholic and I have no dad. I literally felt the same shame my whole life and probably will always feel less than. Like a broken toy.   I‚Äôm almost done with my masters at Harvard.  The feeling of inadequacy and fighting your way out of the proverbial dark place will probably never go away. I still feel like a stupid piece of shit.  I was also accepted to my top choice of medical school.   Good luck, my dude. You deserve all the good things in life.  You will kick ass. You don‚Äôt have to become your genetics and obvi you haven‚Äôt.   
Congrats to him for overcoming major adversity
Damn that‚Äôs a handsome dude
Some beginning meth-heads actually have amazing teeth because they will brush like 10 times a day out of fear that they will get meth-mouth. I worked with a dude who had done shit loads of meth in his life and you would never be able to tell, especially not based on his teeth which were amazingly white.   Not saying that‚Äôs the case here, I‚Äôm just pointing out that meth is fucking crazy, and sometimes meth heads are hiding in plain sight. Those ‚Äúfaces of meth‚Äù are usually extreme results and not every meth head looks that fucked up. 
This guy will have many good things coming to him in life
Uams is also where my mom fought and beat cancer. Twice.
Don‚Äôt forget the ‚Äúno homo‚Äù
I'm going to accept the downvotes that come with this and say that I think those sentiments are dangerous ones. Love certainly does not conquer all and its been my experience that blood relation can quickly lose all meaning in the face of neglect. No neglected child should feel obligated to love their parents. Forgiveness is nice and can help people heal, but OP does not have to forgive or love his dad to do right in this world. Love is earned and love is a choice. Even familial love.
>I'm probably talking bullshit, but who knows?  I'm sorry but you are talking bullshit. Both of my parents were addicts up until the time they died. Both deaths directly due to alcohol and drugs.   While I love them both, it's pretty irritating to see someone lecture someone else how they should feel about their parents. You are giving over the top bullshit cliches for a very complex emotional situation.
Thanks
If he gets his license, he'll be Dr. Pantymelter.
UAMS is where I go currently for cancer. 
My mom passed there in ‚Äò08 when I was 15, she had lung cancer and lymphoma which caused her to eventually develop extreme pneumonia...the doctors at her regular hospital (St.Michaels in Texarkana) kept turning her away at the ER for weeks when she would go in complaining of abnormal pain....they told her it was just the side effects of chemo and radiation...long story short my oldest brother intervened and took took her to UAMS, within hours they knew exactly what the problem was and tried everything in their power to help her, as well as make her and us comfortable...the way those nurses on the ICU floor took care of me during a time like that is making my grown ass tear up right now lol   Edit: I was actually 16 when she passed, 15 when diagnosed 
you're welcome
I hate to say it but whenever I see guys that good looking I always assume he‚Äôs gay. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an insult or a compliment to gays. 
Stay strong! I can assure you they will find you every possible answer! üí™üèºüí™üèº
Hey wait a minute, you aren't the guy I thanked!
"""He's so perfect, he must be gay"" said like every woman ever"
That was his dad, was proud of his son‚Äôs achievements. :‚Äô)
I care! That's awesome.
Oh wow! How did you do it? I needs to know. Lol Over the past 7 years I‚Äôve gained 150 pounds pretty much because I got sober and divorced at the same time. I‚Äôve been sober 7 years and it was well worth it but it‚Äôs time to do something about it. Help! I miss being average weight.
Amazing, he lost a me.
I went to a strict 1200 calorie diet and walk 4 miles a day, 7 days a week and while I don‚Äôt have a scale (can be discouraging to see fluctuations) I went from 3XL/44 waist jeans to now fitting into XL/40 waist jeans with ease and still falling within a month
We all care about his amazing progress of losing weight.I think we can get great inspiration and motivation from him to lose weight.
Joining a gym and seeing a dietician at least once is a good place to start. The hardest part is sticking to a schedule.
There are a lot of memories in the smile in the background.
This is one of the most beautiful things I‚Äôve ever seen. 
My child arrived just the other day.  He came to the world in the usual way
I was so confused by the title until I saw the guy in the background. So wholesome. 
I call these time machine moments.   This one moment is in all three people‚Äôs present, but also in the older dad‚Äôs past, the younger dad‚Äôs past and future, and the baby‚Äôs future - twice!
This is a Redditor‚Äôs picture from a previous post months ago.  I‚Äôm trying to figure out his info to tag him.    Thanks for the gilding, u/BlackKnightsTunic.  Appreciate ya!
It is gorgeous- I am leaning towards the r/childfree side but seeing this makes me want to give my dad grandchildren. 
I sometimes wish there was a camera capturing the mundane humdrum interactions of me with my kids.  When my oldest and I are in a really good conversation while driving to the grocery store; when the middle is making a joke about farts or poop or penis and I'm simply loving his silliness; when the youngest is snuggled up and sniffly with his blankie against my chest...  the moments that are simultaneously nothing and *everything*.     From a biological standpoint, these kids are *my* sole reason for existing.  But there are so many tiny little moments of such immense love and *joy* I feel that *they exist!*  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  He learned to walk while I was away 
Like this, I think. u/siredwardh  Here's [the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6k1s41/my_dad_loving_the_sight_of_his_son_being_a_dad/)  ETA: people gave this comment love and I appreciate it. u/mric124 deserves some love for identifying this as a repost and whoever created [Karma Decay](http://karmadecay.com/) deserve a lot of love for giving us a simple, effectively tool for doing reverse image searches of Reddit.

You‚Äôre the best.  I‚Äôd give you gold if I weren‚Äôt broke bc I always want to give credit to OC and you found him.    Edit:  Thank you, anonymous gilder!

"I also like the way the post is written, not to push any agendas but just to share the wholesomeness of that anecdote.  Sometimes people who intend well will say things like ""Glad to see there are still some good cops around..."" or ""Much thanks to XX police department for actually being trained to respect the people they serve... "", which may come across as very negative and hostile.   "
I remember right after 9/11, when tensions were really high. My city in TN had a place called 'Ali-Baba's Time Out Deli' that had been there for twenty years and it started getting death threats.   Over a hundred people who would be close to borderline /r/trashy went there and told him not to worry. They were all going to set up around the block and stay there for as long as they needed to. He should just go about business as usual and know that he had nothing to worry about.  So, yeah, we got the first kind of people here, the kind making the calls, but we got way more of the second kind.   
I'm not surprised that you're surprised. I was born and raised in southern Ga and brought up to with manners and to respect every one. It really blows my mind the people think residents of the South are all racist, backwards rednecks.
Just goes to show that negativity makes the news more often. People are better than we give then credit for. We just more frequently hear about the bad ones.
I grew up in Gwinnett! Love this. üíô
Turns out most people aren't assholes. 
For some reason, gwinnett cops are really good about not being racist ducks. The closer to the perimiter you get, the worse their racism gets.  Edit: ducks
Not as many racists in the south as theyd lead you to believe. 
I've lived in NW GA my whole life and it does my heart good to see the Deep South accurately represented like this instead of the cartoonish racist stereotypical rednecks we're often portrayed as
Started reading that before checking the subreddit, could‚Äôve sworn this was going to go the other way. Big smiles!
Muslim-Americans are generally really wholesome people, most of the ones you meet are your friends forever.
‚ÄúI was pleasantly surprised people in the Deep South weren‚Äôt racist, backwards, sister fucking retards.‚Äù
99% of the people making the phone calls were too pussy to even do anything, just anonymous threats. That‚Äôs how they always are.
Jon Stewart had a great line about that one the first Daily Show episode after 9/11:  >The reason I don‚Äôt worry about society is, nineteen people knocked down two buildings and killed thousands. Hundreds of people ran into those buildings to save them. I‚Äôll take those odds every f*cking day.
I did a big USA trip a few years back and coming from Australia I found people in the south much nicer.   Places like Mass, New York, New Jersey people tend to assume your an asshole or going to ruin their day and come around to you being nice. Like you have to earn their being nice.  Down south it was like everyone assumes your a nice person and you have to earn them thinking you are an asshole by being rude. I enjoyed all the places I went, but if your a respectful person, the south is very hospitable back.  
This has nothing to do with the post but does have to do with people thinking residents of the south are all racist..  I‚Äôm interested in moving there from progressive Oregon and my mom is throwing a fit that she can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd want to live with a bunch of racist people and that I‚Äôll hate it. While I understand part of her saying things like that is due to not wanting me to leave, it does make me hesitate and try to figure out a way to see if I can spend enough time there before buying a house there (cause for move, buying a house).  With that said, can you expand a bit more on the general lack of racism if at all possible? I‚Äôve been led to believe that segregation is still illegal but that poc and whites don‚Äôt really socialize, poc are looked down on by whites, that sort of thing. I‚Äôm white and not racist, if that helps.   Edit: in between posting this comment and just now getting all these replies that I haven‚Äôt even begun to read yet, I received some tough life talk and really needed a smile on my face. Thankfully I‚Äôm already in this sub and the number of people who‚Äôve already replied have already given it to me. Thanks folks. I‚Äôll read every one of them.   Edit 2: I love you all, everyone gets an updoot and has given warmth to my heart, thank you all so much for responding. You all make me want to move so much more üòÅ
Unfortunately, it only takes 1 rotten apple to ruin the whole pie. 
Hopefully you're not a peachtree ridge bastard
There's this ridiculous notion that if you aren't white anywhere rural in the south that you'll get harassed within 30 seconds of getting out of your car to get gas en route to a large city traveling from another large city.  Personally I've never encountered such thing to enforce this stereotype in any type of way in real life. 
Honestly, every day I hear stories about the ducks, they‚Äôre getting worse and worse every day. 
In my experience, most ethnic groups are generally good people, you just have a few assholes from each that ruin it for everyone and create some stereotype (Muslim - Terrorist, White Male - School Shooter, Black Male - Gangbanger, etc)  Edit: My highest rated comment is a vague summary about how people are generally good. I think I‚Äôm okay with that lol
Long before I was born, but one of my mother‚Äôs favorite stories is how she was spending Christmas alone one time and was really depressed about it, so her Shiite neighbors took her out to buy a Christmas tree and spent the entire day with her to cheer her up. It‚Äôs always a heartwarming story to hear.
I took a couple courses in Arabic language and culture in college, the professor was a very well known man in the local Muslim community here (Western NY). He is legitimately, in every way, one of the best people I‚Äôve ever met in my life.  This is reminding me that I should call him and just say hello.
I‚Äôve lived in the ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù south, and I‚Äôve lived in bustling DC. If I needed help, even as a black man, I would rather need it in ‚Äúthe south‚Äù than DC. Some of the nicest people I ever met come from the south. 
It‚Äôs good they don‚Äôt go through with it. 
[As Mr Rogers said, always look for the helpers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LGHtc_D328) 
The South is the best part of America, culturally, without a doubt 
In Mass, everyone thinks everyone is an asshole.  All races are equal assholes in the land of Massholes
I‚Äôm originally from New York and now living in small-town Alabama, and I can genuinely say Ive witnessed LESS racism down here than I ever did up there. It just goes against the modern southern mentality to be rude to another person deliberately - they‚Äôre a welcoming people! When a Spanish-speaking woman came into our clinic, the nurses and desk staff worked so hard to find somebody who could communicate with her. They sat her in the lobby and used Google translate to tell her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry sweetie, we‚Äôll find someone!‚Äù and called in an off-duty staff member to come translate. Up North, they treat immigrants with disdain. I was so impressed!   I will say, though, that sexism is alive and well down here. You learn to bear it, but if you‚Äôre a woman expect to be asked a million times when you‚Äôre going to have babies and settle down. Social life in small town South also revolves almost entirely around church-sponsored events (Christian, of course) and if you‚Äôre not religious, you‚Äôll find it a little harder to make friends.   Good luck with your move! 
I‚Äôve lived in the south almost all my life and it‚Äôs definitely not fair to say that there is a lack of racism, but it‚Äôs far more understated that stereotypes would have you believe. Also, in public, politeness is highly valued in the south, whether it‚Äôs genuine or superficial. This means a lot of people keep their racist opinions to themselves until they are around people they know well.
Alright so you went to Collins Hill when did you graduate 
Just gotta watch out for those melting pot half black Muslim school shooting terrorist gangbangers. They do make a great kebab though.  /s
Well, they don't sound shite at all.
I took Arabic in undergrad and we went to a Mosque as a sort of cultural field trip.  Easily the most inviting people I've ever met.  Food was good too.
As long as a majority of our society continues to look down upon such nasty behavior. It's when society accepts or becomes complacent of such behavior that people will go through with such hate and violence.   So, keep em it up folks, don't let the big bad wolf blow you down. They're nothing without a pack.
Uhhhhh that's a stretch. 
The settle down and have babies thing is true of anyone in those areas. Once you reach about 25 or so people will ask you when you plan on meeting a girl and getting married. can be very frustrating I know. But that's just the culture.  
/r/surprisecannibalism  
Why did I expect this reply?
Man I grew up two doors down from a mosque. Skinny white kid with no religion but always got invites for great food and hanging out. Same guys that called the police on the Manchester bomber over twenty times cause he was shifty and kicked him out. Cops didn‚Äôt bloody listen then you get this backlash from idiots that hate all mosques.  
I live in the south and I'm a hijabi. You do get treated rather rudely, actual double takes stares, worse service, ect.
Hands down experienced more racism in the northeast than I ever have in the south. 
"It's because they think they can get away with it, because at least they ""aren't the south""."
Congratulations!! That's a hard life to escape from, kudos to you sir and NEVER let anyone downplay your strength!
Well done in so many ways, most of all for beating that devil.
I just started working as a prosecutor. I'm really glad to see someone reach the other side and turn it around!  Is there anything you might recommend a prosecutor to do in those situations which would make that transition easier for a user?  Edit: I just wanted to know how this person was prosecuted and how it impacted their transition to law-abiding behavior. I'm not gonna set my prosecution practice based on one person from the internet.  Also, thanks for the gold!
I hope it‚Äôs not offensive to say so but you look really healthy for someone with such a long history of heavy drug use. Congratulations on getting clean and I wish you all the luck moving forward.
There's no better feeling than teaching enthusiastic young people, especially in an ever-growing technological world. This is a feel good story all around!
"Whew. Meth = Main Entrance To Hell  Edit: this is a bulk thank you from the bottom of my heart, to all those that commented positively. I had an idea that this post would be popular, but geez, I'm glad it's helping so many of you see the brighter side of life. Take this with you as you end your day today; never give up hope for yourself. I made it from the ABSOLUTE bottom, so wherever you are in life, you will make it too.  Edit: By. The. Way. These are my meth mugshots. I was able to petition the court for them since I own a substance abuse prevention nonprofit as well:  https://i.imgur.com/UsguXN1.jpg  Final Edit: I need to clarify something badly. I started using crack when I was 18. I did not mean to say crack and meth only. I totally meant to add ""drugs"" in there too. I started smoking cigarettes when I was 13, pot at 16, alcohol at 16, cocaine at 18, crack at 18, pills at 18, meth at 29. 20 years of DRUG addiction."

I'm about to do the only thing that can be done; Tell my entire life story. Be as brutally honest as I can be and give them information that is being kept from them. No more scare tactics. They already know more than we want them to know because of technology, and we need to embrace it. 8 is the new 18. Things are not like they were when I was a kid...
Seriously overcoming addiction to both meth and crack is an incredible display of self control and inner strength. You should be fucking proud of yourself. You did what most cannot do. Stay safe and good luck mate.
I‚Äôm so happy for you that you got clean!   I‚Äôve never done it and I‚Äôm so glad.
Hey man, I recently began working as a police officer and the damage that meth does to people and their lives is heartbreaking. I'm so glad to see that you survived it and managed to break your addiction. I'm also a car guy, so it's nice to see you teaching the new generation! I have a lot of respect for you, and I hope you all the best.

My buddy just told me that instead of sending them to prison, send them as far away from their comforts as possible. And not to a halfway house or anything like that. Make them start fresh in a new place and tell them they will go to prison if they try to contact anyone from their past.
Man, these unattainable beauty standards are getting worse and worse.
The whole top half of her head - amputated.  Good on her for persevering.  Edit: Thanks for the Ag
It is cool but it would be absolutely badass if she had cool bionic arm.
Pretty sure I've seen disabled models used by River Island too. What I find great is that a lot of children's TV shows have started doing this too (shout-out Cbeebies). My kids look at it, ask why, and then never bat an eyelid at it again whether on screen or in person.
Is someone born without a limb considered an amputee or is there another word for it? I think she was born without it based [on a page someone linked here](http://www.thealternativelimbproject.com/kelly-knox/) (or maybe something happened during birth, unsure.
That is one smooth nub
Which store? Very cool!
That must of cost her an arm and a leg     I'm sorry 
That's quite attainable, but there is a reason fireworke come with a warning label
Part of her legs too. What a soldier.
[http://www.thealternativelimbproject.com/kelly-knox/](http://www.thealternativelimbproject.com/kelly-knox/)   ENJOY! =) Thanks for inspiring me to find out if she has one. Kelly Knox rocks!
My favorite thing about using more amputee actors and models is that it normalizes the lack of limbs and those with prosthetics, thus making cyborgs more commonplace in the public perception and revealing that *the future is now bitches, and it's cool as hell!*
"Yes they are but they are referred to as a congenital amputee:  *""Congenital¬†amputation¬†is birth¬†without a limb¬†or¬†limbs, or without¬†a part of a limb¬†or¬†limbs.""*      https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_amputation?wprov=sfla1"
Looks like primark. Matalan also have a lot of models with various disabilities. I love that they don't make it the selling point of the add
"> This is strange. A vast majority of people are not disabled.  Ok so point 1. A vast majority of people are also not 6ft size 4 blondes with perfect hair and flawless proportions, which is what is usually on these posters so the ""doesn't represent the target audience"" thing doesn't really make any sense.  And point 2. This woman is clearly conventionally attractive, it's not like she's there solely to appeal to the handless."
She‚Äôs modelling a jumper, not gloves. 
Dude did you see that stump? Small, perfectly round, no visible scar, its like the perfect numb in existance. This is gold standard.  Most most limbless peasants have a stump that looks like mister potato head if a child cut him open and tried to stitch him back together... 
Still a 10

If it was a birth defect instead of surgical amputation the stub is typically much smoother
Yeah it was Primark!
The media perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards once again...
Keep describing the stump I‚Äôm almost there. 
It's easy to be a 10 when you're 2/3 of a 15. 
Ok she‚Äôs beautiful, but that‚Äôs actually kind of unsettling. 
Soo uhhh, you think she ever gets freaky with that thing??
I mean if she hasn‚Äôt tried then what‚Äôs the point of having it really. 
If I have received unusually good customer service, I sometimes go out of my way to tell management. It takes extra effort and time, but it‚Äôs good for everyone. Good on that person who sent the email!

Looks like whoever designed that print out is in kahootz with the toner supplier.

It‚Äôs so sad that so many positive comments never get passed on to the employee. Well... in all the retail jobs I worked, anyway. I do the same. I make it my mission to make sure someone knows a person did a good job. But I know that more often than not, it won‚Äôt get back to the employee.
He's not my kid, I just stumbled across this on Twitter but well done that kid huh? Not many of his age would have the patience and compassion to act like he did.

This is one of the best wedding ideas I have ever seen, completely awesome!
This is so beautiful. Makes me miss my Nana so much.
Goodness, they're stunning! Those dresses!  What a brilliant idea.  (I'm amazed how much they look alike!)
My cousin did this at her wedding too! The grandmothers had so much fun and everyone was laughing with joy. :)
They look beautiful, like wise goddesses in a greek myth.
https://www.today.com/style/these-grandmothers-are-world-s-most-adorable-flower-girls-t100785
Grandmas proved, unknowingly, flowergirl kids are over-rated! JK!! Grandmas, you two are beautiful!
"It really is.     Traditionally flower girls have historically represented either the innocence of the bride or wishes of fertility for the bride and groom, but it almost makes more sense for the grandmothers to be the ""golden"" flower girls to represent where they came from.   They (others wanting to do something similar) could each have  different color flowers  representing each side of the family and dropping them represents the mingling of the two families, fertility, etc."
I came here to say this so have my ditto. What a beautiful photo.
My grandma died this morning, and this has me in a mess
We had 2 of my now-ex wife's friends. Both very pretty late teenage girls who both loved being the flower girls.  Of course, a suspiciously large proportion of all photos taken by guests were of those two. Because we can't have nice things.
I love this idea so much!! Too bad I'm already married, lol.
This pic alone has brightened my day. Thank you, OP.
"Lol did u really just use the phrase ""tried and true"" as if it were a car u needed to get to work?  Its a celebration. They can do whatever the fuck they want if thats how they wana remember the day."
I'm really sorry for your loss. Not long after my grandma passed, I found a poem that I'll attach below. It helped me view her passing more positively and provided the same sort of comfort when other members of my family passed as well. I hope that it can provide some comfort for you, too.   >Do not stand at my grave and weep >I am not there; I do not sleep. >I am a thousand winds that blow, >I am the diamond glints on snow, >I am the sun on ripened grain, >I am the gentle autumn rain. >When you awaken in the morning's hush >I am the swift uplifting rush >Of quiet birds in circled flight. >I am the soft stars that shine at night. >Do not stand at my grave and cry, >I am not there; I did not die.  -Mary Elizabeth Frye
There is always divorce. Shoot for the stars
My grandma passed last month and I chose that exact poem for her funeral program. I miss her so much.
Over the top vow renewal?
Love it. Took me a while to get off my butt and into the gym. But now that i go at least a few times a week, i see how it makes you feel better. Wish i had learned when i was younger,  trying to get back in shape has been rough and caused some injuries while i learn the limits of my older body,  but i love it so much.
I don‚Äôt enjoy celebrating 
"I used to say "" running is a celebration"" ""Of what?"" People would ask.  ""Of being able ro run"" was my answer."
I think I get to decide what I'm exercising for. Most of the time it's to burn off excess pizza and beer calories.
The worst part is getting started ... I‚Äôm there 
"When your focus changes from ""need to look like a fitness model"" to ""just want to wake up feeling fresh in the morning"" the gym becomes a much nicer experience."
Absolutely this. Many humans have no idea how fast the body reacts to just a little bit of consistent physical challenge. Training a 90+ year old and seeing them make improvements is mind-blowing. It is truly never too late. 
 i enjoy being miserable, that's why I work out and eat raw vegetables 
In the academy we would say we were running for those who can't, fallen officers who made the ultimate sacrifice. No way you can feel sorry for yourself with that thought in your mind.
Positively this. There was a time an hour's workout just wasn't worth the time to me, but now I see it as trading an hour of my time so the other 15 waking ones aren't filled with fatigue, depression, low self-esteem, list goes on.
Bruh. Forreal. But actually it‚Äôs super relatable. I just recently started and I‚Äôm hoping that I can make it habitual. 
"I've found just starting is the hardest part. If necessary when I don't want to I just shut off my brain, toss on my workout clothes and get to it. After you've taken the first step, done the first lift or push up, momentum takes over and your mindset changes to ""well, I'm already here, might as well do this."" Notice how good you feel the day after a workout, and if you miss a few use that shitty feeling as fuel under your ass. Most of all, make it a good experience for yourself, just like the quote says. :)"

When did they start adding decimals to license plates?
I had a 2.0 GPA in college. Absolute lowest that I could have gotten and still graduate. I finished dead last in my class.  However, almost half the kids that I started college with didn't graduate from my school, so I finished ahead of all of them. After I got my first job, no one ever asked about my GPA until I applied to grad school, and even then, my professional experience made a much bigger difference.  I fucked around in college, and wasted a lot of time, but I learned a lot (even if my grades didn't reflect it), and while I didn't take the path to climb the same corporate ladder that my friends did, I've got a family, a house, a good job, I'm back in school, and this time, my GPA is 3.5.  If you've failed at things before, don't let those failures define who you are. Decide what it is that you want to do, and just get out there and do it.

Does the 2.7 GPA mean something in the US?  EDIT: Thank you for your answers. No need to answer anymore.
Actually i've met several very successful business-persons in NYC that either left college or did mediocre work there.  School is just a tool to train your mind and gather information. It's really about what value you bring to the table in the real world (unless its a highly specialized field like Neuroscience, etc)
This is so much better than the r/iamverysmart post with the 4.0 GPA plate.
This is mostly motivational for those with a 2.7 GPA and lower... like me for example 
"Read on here just yesterday, after a post with a small Nissan boasting a license plate saying ""4.0 GPA"", that the average millionaires GPA was/is 2.9, so that's a majority of the backstory of this picture.   Good new is: my GPA was 2.8ish... So it's just a matter of time before all that good money finds my pockets (nothing yet worth bragging of), right?.."

There are lots of reasons I think successful people get mediocre grades. One thing that always occurred to me as an investor is it takes 20% more effort to get a B but it takes 100% more effort to get an A. So I go for the bargain grade. B is for bargain.

Do you know what they call the person who graduates last in Medical School?  Doctor
Does GPA really matter in masters? By that time you usually have tons of career experience that far outweighs some arbitrary number
I have a friend who went to Harvard as a C student for undergrad, he outperformed most students in his core classes by a huge margin because anything he wasn‚Äôt interested in he would calculate the minimum grade and effort he needed to pass. The guy came in within 1% of not having a diploma before graduation, and turned in his last final with a third of the questions blank. He got the diploma and all the time he saved avoiding things he didn‚Äôt care about let him spend enough time in the lab to start a communications company right after graduating.  The point is breaking down an entire person to some number tends to miss what‚Äôs actually going on and your guess is as good as any.
Better start sucking one
Yeah, you can even get a heart put onto your license plate in Texas. 
I see your point. 
You're welcome! I'm about 10 years out from school now, and just started back at school getting an MBA to try to change careers. Everyone I talk to tells me how tough it will be to make a big change when I'm in my 30s, but just because that's not how they did it, doesn't mean that it can't be how I did it, and if I do it now, in five years, no one will care, and if I don't do it now, in five years, it won't be any easier.
Stress isn't the worst thing in the world! I bet if I had been more stressed in college, I would have gotten better grades. Just remember that the only person who you'll have to spend your entire life with is yourself, so make sure  you like yourself before worrying about anyone else's plans for you.  Internships are important, but worry less about which internship you get, and more about making the best out of whichever one you get. Grades are also important, and if you're dead set on medical school, or getting some big corporate job in a shiny office building downtown, they matter, but there are a lot of people in the world who aren't as smart, or as hardworking as you are, and they've done just fine.  You'll be alright.
I grew up dirt poor and struggled working while in college and had a 2.7 gpa and I‚Äôm getting my Tesla next year!  
I graduated valedictorian in high school and with honors in college. IQ tested as a kid several times with results ranging from 140 to 160. Currently make 14k a year as a TV photographer.  A random kid on a shoot called me a failure today. I think I probably agree with her.
"A lot of self-made people, at least for me, got 4.0's not to be ""the 4.0 person"" but to prove to themselves they would pursue their goals and actually work hard. In the end gpa is just a number, but it can also illustrate a person's dedication, not just book smarts."

Dude still owns a Ferrari which is the point.
The point is he has a very average GPA but owns a really nice car
A 2.7 would put him at a mid C or 75/100. 59/100 is considered failing and 69/100 or lower means your proably going to be retaking the class. This would mean that hes barely passing all of his classes or failing some and doing really well in others.

He also held a private meeting with [war widows](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53070-2005Apr14.html) and let them straight blast him. He just took it.   There was also this incident at Walter Reed:  > In her book ‚ÄúAnd The Good News Is,‚Äù Dana Perino, who was Bush‚Äôs press secretary, recounted a 2005 visit to Walter Reed. It was marked by a tense moment with the mother of a gravely wounded service member. The mother wanted to know why her child, and not Bush‚Äôs, was clinging to life, Perino wrote. The president tried unsuccessfully to comfort her. So rather than continue to speak, he simply listened, absorbing her anger and grief. Departing the hospital aboard Marine One, Bush allowed a single tear to roll down his cheek, Perino noted in her book. ‚ÄúThat mama sure was mad at me,‚Äù the president said. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt blame her a bit.‚Äù  Also, since leaving office he's worked on [advocacy for the wounded,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/10/21/were-not-just-random-people-how-george-w-bush-connected-with-those-he-sent-to-war/?utm_term=.af570b9a0a20) participated in [children's charities,](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/21/george-w-bush-dressed-as-santa-hands-out-toys-at-c/) and worked to establish the [Clinton Bush Haiti Fund](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/01/16/clinton-bush-haiti-fund) among many other things.  Had it not been for 9/11 he likely would have had one of the more boring presidencies and in all likelihood wouldn't have been reelected. He really was a decent dude who got stuck with a raw deal and royally fucked it up after getting terrible advice. 
Dude also gets along with the Obamas. Pretty sure the current GOP would be calling for his head if he was buddies with O after his presidency lol. Dude seems genuine although misguided but I feel as though that was more of Cheney‚Äôs work. 
You realize that Congress declared war, not the President, and it was at the time nearly unanimous? There was a vote to take military action and Congress approved it. If the President made the decision without Congress the process would‚Äôve been much more similar to Vietnam, and would have been illegal for us to still be in the Middle East at this point.

"I was listening to report on NPR the other day examining hyper-intelligent people in similar situations. They had this one kid who offered a quote I identified with big time. His voice quivering, he said, ""Ignorance is bliss, and, man, do I wish I had some.""  Probably the most idenfiable book I've read on this is Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament. I find it remarkable that even 3,500 years ago, writers were saying things like, ""For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.""   The struggle is as old as time."

That's an easy fallacy to make. Just because someone is bad, doesn't mean they put in less effort. In my experience, the people who are in the bottom 10 put in more effort than some people who are average or even good.    TL;DR There is not really a strong correlation between low effort and bad grades.  Edit: Added strong because sometimes but far from always it is correlated.

I'm speechless and overwhelmed by all your positive replies. I wrote this from the heart and I really wanted to make an impact. I never thought so many would care about this.  I have tears in my eyes now, but these are tears of happiness. The funny thing about this situation is that I don't think I have ever cried because of happiness before.

I have decided to save your post and I want to let you know that I plan on reading it from time to time for years to come, to remind me of the importance of giving all I got and to appreciate the time I have.

Hey man, don't give up. I had cancer twice - the first time stage 3 and the second time stage 4. I had a 0% chance of survival both times - with or without treatment. My parents chose to go with treatment in hopes that it would pay off. I'm now 18 years in remission and still kicking!!! STAY POSITIVE!!! Anything is possible.
Hey man, are there any last wishes we can help you with? Have you seen the Grand Canyon? Would you like to meet Elon Musk? Do you want to take a look at the stars through the most badass telescopes? This is the internet man, we can make almost anything happen.  Edit: hey guys, OP says he doesnt want us to do anything at all towards him, he'd rather spend time with his family. So lets respect his wishes. As much as I'd like OP to at least name his cancer or a charity he'd like us to donate to, this was not his intention. I suppose just live a good life and stay motivated.
Some times is coincidence, sometimes not. I just read this while waiting to talk with the coordinator of my Masters. I'm doing part of my dream, I'm doing a masters in 3 countries about mathematics and on the very first semester I manage to fail 2 of 5 subjects while I'm allowed only to fail one. I'm feeling awful about throwing one life time opportunity away due laziness. I know that I'm capable but I simple didn't studied. I'm destroyed by inside. But after reading your text I realised that there are worst things that can happen to me. And that even if that happen, I need to find my way to pursue my happiness and do something amazing from my life. I would like you to know that you really did something important in my life. You, a complete stranger. We never met, we never talked, we never see each other. But you changed my life. At least in this moment or maybe all my future. Thank you. I will do my best to honor your words. I love you my friend. And I will miss you.
Fantastic post. Best post I've read in a while.   Excellent tie choice, by the way. 
I'm 23 currently fighting cancer. Thank you for this. I'm in a time where I have to be a man but underneath it all I'm so scared. Your words gave me a different look on all this for the better. Thank you friend. 
I'd buy you gold, but I can only assume you're not going to be wasting any more time on Reddit...  In fact, I'm taking a few days off of Reddit to reassess how I'm spending my time.  Thank you.   Also wicked tie, bro.
This is honestly the most motivating piece of work i've seen on this sub. Thank you. 
"/u/mylasttie Thank you for unselfishly sharing your thoughts and inspirational advice all while remaining in a positive mindset despite such unsettling circumstances. My heart goes out to you and your family. And for the record, your tie is absolutely perfect.  I wanted to share something with you and others here as well:  [""You want a physicist to speak at your funeral."" - by Aaron Freeman](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4675953) You may listen to him read aloud his essay at that link and here is a transcript:  > AARON FREEMAN:  >You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the [conservation of energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy), so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.  >And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.  >And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.  >And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly.   >Amen. "

Thank you and only goodwill to you and your family.  http://i.imgur.com/ZmCffbp.jpg  Edit: just found out my stepfather may have lung/liver cancer. Your words mean even more now. **tears**
Loving you mate. Believe me, sharing this with us is something that really count.  I tried to create something to hang of my wall, just to remind of your wise words.  http://imgur.com/a/56Br2  I am not a designer (yet) so I used a service to do it and I am quite hapy of the result. Hopefully other guys here will find those useful. I'm definitely going to print those and hang them in my house, in Krakow, Poland.  Much love for you and your close ones. You are amazing.
I'm a cancer patient too. I was diagnosed with leukaemia 3 years ago and told I had a 10-20% chance of surviving. I relapsed after my first bone marrow transplant, and prior to receiving my second, my chances of a cure were nearly 0. But I'm still here - 2 years after my second today. Recently, I've lost vision in my left eye. Permanently. I'm still not sure what the cause is... and I recorded this when I found out it was gone forever.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEAQ6HjuF5s One thing I've always urged, in my blogs, in my talks, whether it be directed at medical students, doctors, or just regular people is exactly what this unfortunate man is saying.... Don't wait for something bad to happen to change yourself and the world around you for the better.   But I also want you all to know that no matter who you are, no matter what challenges you face, or goals you wanna achieve, that you CAN do what you really want to.  It may not happen straight away, it will take time and effort to get there, but if you take a step back, look at what's happened objectively and just ask why of all your obstacles, over and over again, you give yourself the best chance of succeeding.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgo8Q0etQrg  It's what I did to stay as happy and healthy as possible through my journey with cancer. It's what I'm doing to become the best doctor I can be, while also supporting others, starting up a new platform for charities to secure funds, and writing a book on how to make pharmaceuticals more efficient; so patients like us, all around the world, in 20 years from now never have to suffer as much as we do now.
You wear that duckie tie proudly, dammit. 
Someday, I'll see you on the other side and tell you that you have indeed left a mark on this world.  Edit: Nice tie btw
May your journey to the light be peaceful. A fantastic insight for all readers. Thank you for sharing.
Just shed a few tears at work, this is by far the best post I have read on here and I have saved it. For the past few months I have been struggling to motivate myself but after reading this I am motivated again to do the things I want. Your first bullet point hit home as I fucking detest my job...I will now enroll in a college course to become a PT, something I have always wanted to do but didn't because of other people opinion which is your second point, I have found my sport that makes me happy and your final point about family is perfect, my mum and dad are fucking mega stars and I don't tell them enough and my GF is the single greatest thing in my life, so much so on our 10 year anniversary(13th March) I will ask her to marry me! I'm not letting her go.  You are a fucking great human being and you have put everything into perspective for me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  p.s. your tie fucking rocks :) 
None of us are facing death any less square in the eyes than you, it's just that for a lot of us, it's a little further away. Life is a straight line segment, and nothing any of us can do can change or reverse that. Your advice is sound, and I hope everyone can see that you don't need a terminal diagnosis to accept that advice with complete passion. Thank you so much for this post. It served me as an excellent reminder.
  >The way I‚Äôve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.  Sharing your realizations and thoughts as you prepare for the end of your life = one extremely impactful thing you have done in your existence.    Your courage is admirable. I love the tie. Thank you for this amazing motivation.   I wish there was something I could do in return. 
You have certainly made an impact in my life, even though 10 minutes ago you weren't a part of it. We thank you!
I've written your username on my desk so you will not be forgotten, man. Thanks for all of this, and I'll seeya up there in a couple of decades. Godspeed you magnificent being.
You seem to be an incredibly lovely human being. I don't think you quite realise how many lives you are going to change with this post.  Thank you.  EDIT: Also that tie is bitchin', where can I get one?
I'm sure you realise this, but you've had a huge effect on a large number of people with this post alone. I'm certainly one of those people, and from the bottom of my heart - thank you. You've made me question a lot of things in my life, and I can't begin to explain how much this post has helped me.  I cannot thank you enough for this. You've most definitely left your mark, and to do so it in such an inspiring way, especially in your situation, is breathtaking. Your outlook and bravery are a testament to you, and will remain that way for a very long time.
That makes two of us.
"That sounds badass beyond anything I've heard in a while.   ""I had 0% chance of survival both times"" yet here you are.   Rock on, dude"
Wow, that's amazing :) Made me happy to read.
Just tweeted Elon @elonmusk about this. Everyone else do the same and gain some visibility. We can make it happen.
"Guys, I think your missing the point of his post. Obviously its a nice sentiment to suggest him meeting Elon Musk, and it would be unbelievable if that happned- but it's not the point he's trying to convey at all.  He's encouraging us to form relationships, and find your passions and most importantly do/make something that will have an impact on the world.   >""It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful.""   To be clear I'm not undermining this idea in any way, I'm all for it. I just think this isn't us seeing the bigger picture he was trying to portray. It is devastating that he has cancer, but his message is a powerful and exciting one. Great post man:) "
For real. The first thing I thought after reading this is he should try to meet Musk. Just need to get this in front of him.
Upvoted for visibility. 
You're not alone.
I'd just like to wish you some luck on your master's, if you decide to continue.  I graduated with mine about a year ago, but let me tell you, there were plenty of times I didn't think I had it in me.  My first thesis, due in part to some issues with my first adviser, was rejected.  I fell into a bottomless pit and it took me a really long time to crawl out.  I thought about just giving up.  I didn't and went on to pen something that I could at least graduate with and even received a pretty decent mark.  If it's what you want, I'm sure you can push through and accomplish.  I've moved on to a new struggle, finding a job, but I know if I could make it through my thesis, I can find some way to put it to good use.  I'm sure you can accomplish whatever you want, also.  Best of luck.
Instead of making me sadder this post just made me happier. It brightened up my day!
Being a man doesn't mean you can't be scared. Keep fighting. I am rooting for you! :)
Judging by that tie, OP has all his ducks in a row.   May we all be so well prepared when it's our time.
"I like that the world ""LIFE"" is a lot bigger than ""cancer""."
That's awesome. Quitting is an excellent decision and when you have trouble try to remember that no one ever regrets doing it. 
Way to go, man. 
Three of us.
Technically we all have a 0% chance of survival.....
Thank you all for doing this!!! It's so amazing! It's not about my last wish, however. It's not about me at all. Although I think Elon Musk is one of the men who has the capacity to change the world, I don't want this to be about me. Knowing that I have touched your lives is enough. Truthfully, I would like to spend what time I have left quietly with my loved ones. That's all that matters. But again, thank you all from the bottom of my heart!   P.S. To the guys who said they'd quit smoking, you have my full support! I'd be grateful to you if you really quit. 
Is there a #? 
I know what he is encouraging us to do, and he's done it - he's made a lot of people's day and motivated a lot of people. He's only got a little time left in the world though, and honestly, I'd love nothing more than to see him do what so few others have been able to before he goes, whether it be talk with one of the greats, see some of the worlds best sights, experience that one experience he's always wanted to.  It isn't game over just yet.
Just realize that every upvote this guy gets is another person who read your post and felt the same way. Hang in there, friend!
"When I was 9 years old I made my dad quit cold turkey. We were in the truck just him and I and I said ""do you want to see me graduate?"" he said ""of course!"" ""Then why do you keep smoking?"" I didn't mean to make such a huge impact, I think it was a genuine question after being in DARE that day or something like that, but he quit that day. Threw an entire pack out and never touched them again."
My doctor told me that if I don't quit, I will lose my leg (broke it and severed the aortal).    It amazes me to think that I knew smoking would cause cancer (both grandfathers died of it from smoking),  but that seemed so far fetched. 
Four of us.
There's a slim chance we develop immortality.
"I'm just starting opiate withdrawal/detox, and while it wasn't your words that got me to start, it's your words that will help me to finish. I want more from my life.  Edit: I've planned it all out. I gave the car to my mom. I gave my debit card to my brother. I'm out in the middle of nowhere, with my puppy and enough food and water for two weeks. I only bought off of one guy, and when I told him not to contact me and that I was done, he said ""I know you're better than this shit. Good luck."".  My own dealer wants me clean lol.  Anyways, this is the last time I go through this. I'm very lucky to have a supportive family and a place to stay for 3 weeks. I won't squander this opportunity. Thanks to everyone that responded and messaged me. You all are special people. I hope to join your rank soon."
You have a platform man. Seriously, name anything at all. Even a charity and we will donate to it. Or something for your family. Anything.  Edit: even if you don't have any last wishes that we can give to you, at least let us know what kind of cancer is taking someone as wise as you out of this world, because fuck that cancer, I'll drop a hundred on research against it right now.
Five of us
I'm a year clean from opiates in one week man. You can pull through.  
Opiate withdrawal is a bitch, but life is so much better clean. There is so much more that the world has to offer than drugs. I know how hard it can be, I have gone through this a few times. You will have some bad days (and that is okay, we all do), but you also have so many amazing days to come. Your life will be richer than you could have ever dreamed. I can tell you this honestly: life is better without opiates.   When I'm having a hard time, I try to remember how much withdrawal sucks, and that it always comes if I am using. Fuck being a slave to opiates, or anything at all. Fuck having drugs be the only thing that matters in your life. You deserve more than that, you deserve better. Good luck, I am rooting for you :). Kick addiction in it's stupid shitty fucking ass!! Tell addiction to go fuck itself ;). You will be a free man or woman, and you will be so grateful to yourself in the end.
Let's take him at his word. He wants us to hear him. Let's all do something meaningful today that we would not have done without reading his words.  I'm going to go have dinner with my mom.
PERFECT.
Let's stick to this one and stop suggesting others.
that isnt true.   your father loves you more than you know. cigs are the toughest addiction to break.  i guarantee your father loves you more than his own life...but u cannot compare love/vs addiction.

Every job is important. No matter how insignificant it feels, or how little credit you get, every job is important.     Because at the end of the day, the most important job is the one not being done.
I wonder did Homer think he was just writing silly little stories that wouldn‚Äôt contribute as much as the great philosophers?   Stan Lee helped create the modern notion for what a hero is. What a hero should be.   His contribution to our culture cannot he overstated. And will undoubtedly outlive us all. Only time will tell just how much impact they have made. 
I love me some John Adams, guy was brilliant, crazy, arrogant and humble, a dick and a great friend. 
"Posted this in the other thread, but I think it's relevant here too.      ---      Comic books helped me learn to read well enough to get me out of special ed.    Back when I was in elementary school I was years behind my class in reading, which is actually really impressive for a 1st grader when you take the time to think about it. Worse still was the fact that my school, having been built 40 years earlier, was at full capacity long before special ed 'classrooms' could be assigned, so I and my six fellow special students (who ranged in specialness from ""I have difficulty with verbs"" to ""I have difficulty getting the paste stick out of my nose"") took our classes in a free broom closet. Our teacher, Mrs. Lewis, did the best that she could with us, but since her students were so diverse she really couldn't tend to all of us the way that we needed.  Second and third grade came and went with little improvement in me, it was becoming clear to everybody that I'd peaked at six years old, I was a one star boy, relegated forever to remedial reading.  Like any boy of the 90's though, there were two things that I loved: Video games and the X-Men animated TV show. (Saturday morning was for ballers, back then.) You may or may not remember, but comic books and everything related to them were a big flippin' deal there for a while, new cartoons coming out all the time, games, trading cards, anything to turn a property into a profit, and we were happy to give over our parents' money for it.  Then came the two part animated special X-Men: Days of Future Past, and it was awesome. In fact it was so awesome that I actually bought a book (gasp!) at the next Scholastic book fair (It was the 'novelization' of the episode) and I loved it! Who knew reading could be so much fun? Nobody had to shoot their dog!  Of course comic book fans know that ""Days of Future Past"" was originally a story arc from the comics, so after I'd plowed through the thirty pages of novel in an afternoon (a big deal for me at the time) I went out and bought the comic books, which were even better! I'd read and reread the graphic novels over and over again. When presented with a word I didn't know (which were quite a lot, at first) I'd reach for the dictionary and figure it out. These were everything I needed: Compelling bite-sized stories to entertain the mind, beautiful artwork for the eyes, and writing that neither spoke down to its audience nor spoke over it. Comic books didn't intimidate the way a novel did (and if I'm being honest still does to this day), they weren't something that anybody said to me ""Don't bother reading that, Max, you won't get it."" X-Men opened a door, they made words fascinating where before they had been frustrating, they were everything I didn't know I needed. I thought I was in love with X-Men, but then I discovered Spider-Man: A hero with an unerring moral compass and chronic depression. He was just like me but with super powers and an unerring moral compass! Talk about exciting! Optic blasts and adamantium claws were awesome but difficult to relate to, but a 30-something photographer struggling to reconcile his heroic and humanistic nature was, like, way more awesome than claws! (As an adult I realized that adamantium claws are both cooler and more useful than chronic clinical depression, but we all learn as we get older.) Both Spider-Man and Peter Parker were characters that I could care about, relate to, and most importantly, invest my time and attention into.  Over the next decade or so I read comics by the pound, old stuff, new stuff, boring stuff, exciting stuff, smart stuff, stupid stuff, whatever I could get my eyes on, and right in step with that reading was an improvement in my grades. I'd started school years behind my classmates, but by middle school I'd been moved up to ""Merit"" (read: grade level) classes, then in high school I moved up again to Honors and AP. Comic books really opened the world up for me, they were a most necessary stepping stone without which I don't think I'd ever have cleared the ledge. Some of us are neither Anakin nor Obi Wan, we need middle ground to get where we're going; comic books were my middle ground.  Without Stan Lee and Spider-Man I wouldn't be the man I am today, that's no exaggeration.   In the context of get motivated if make this point: Never underestimate the significance of your contribution. Stan Lee thought he was an entertainer, but for me he was a teacher, a counselor, and a philosopher. A poem can change a life, a smile can save one, and only the person saved will know it. "
Telling stories is part of human nature.  What is in every hospital room? A TV.  You are part of an integral component of being alive, sir.  Never doubt your worth.
When I was paralized last year and stuck in a hospital bed, the doctors didn't do shit for my spirit. Watching Dr. Strange and his journey on repeat had a direct effect on me using my arms (and legs, but his struggle with his hands is what I identified with so much) again so soon. RIP Stan love you 
Not quite! I'm a radio, TV, film guy. Mostly film.
It's not just getting out, staying out is the real hard part. There is always something lurking around the corner waiting to drag you back down and even if you can see it coming, you can't always stop it.
Managed to shower, brush my teeth and put on clean clothes this morning for the first time in almost a week. Still feel terrible but on days like these even small steps are an accomplishment.

The priest writes out a prayer, throws it down in the hole and moves on ""Then a friend walks by, 'Hey, Joe, it's me can you help me out?' And the friend jumps in the hole.

Why doesn‚Äôt this have upvotes. This is the basis of stating to improve your life. Small victories. Be happy one day. Then another. Then another. Coming from someone that had a gun in his mouth six weeks ago; this is important.
Just last night, as I fell asleep, I hoped and prayed that I wouldn't wake up. That somehow I would pass quietly in my sleep. I felt so unworthy of love and affection.    Keep on truckin' guys.
True, I find looking for small things to be happy and excited about help me, like waiting for the next big game or film coming out or trips to new places.

While I feel you, I think one of the big things about depression that gets overlooked is a lot of people *can't* get pleasure out of those things anymore. A lot of people think about depression as being sad, and for many that is part of the equation. But for a great many, it's not feeling sad. It's feeling nothing.  When I'm in my bad place, I try to focus on good things, things I think are fun normally. The kicker is, they're not fun anymore. Like, the motivation to put any effort toward making myself happy is completely sapped. Every positive bit of encouragement I receive comes off as trying to prove how I *should* be happy by this, but I don't feel anything. Then later, when I come out of my funk, I can feel happy again, but it's accompanied by intense guilt for not having been able to be happy about it then.  I don't mean to sound like a negative Nancy, especially in a thread about pulling yourself out of dark places, but I just think there's a fundamental misunderstanding for many about what depression is and why thinking about the good things usually doesn't actually help in a good number of cases. It's not just being sad. It's being unable to control how you feel, and sometimes it's not feeling anything at all.  Edit: Omg thank you so much to all of you who replied to ask questions or share your stories/experiences or offer your advice/techniques. I'm glad beyond words that I could vocalize this experience for so many of you, because it's something that's haunted me for so long, and reading this conversation has made me *feel something*! For that I'm more grateful than I could say.
Hey Reddit!   Jared was overwhelmed with the support for [yesterday‚Äôs post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/85nzj1/image_some_people_just_dont_make_excuses/?st=JF0DIHSA&sh=ec554e0e), and since hundreds of you asked for it, he figured he would start an IG page so people can be a part of his journey. He‚Äôs not on Reddit so comment there!  His: Wellsy351  Mine: ficksndinner  I finally was able to talk to him and he couldn‚Äôt believe how amazing GetMotivated was in the comments and replies!   Thank you everyone!   Edit: it IS ‚ÄòJared‚Äô, not ‚ÄòJarod‚Äô and no, its not 0% body fat, Bob got a little carried away in his post and yes I was cleared by doctors to begin lifting. 
Now there is a look of determination! Good luck buddy
I did, actually. Slept til 11. Got some ice cream, watched Dr. Phil. Spanked it a couple times. And took a sweet ass nap with the thermostat cranked to 75¬∞. I'ma get up pretty quick, tho.   And stir a batch of margaritas.
And now I'm doing burpees on my vacation. Thanks Jared.
His face reminds me a lot of Kylo Ren.   Stab obstacles in the stomach, Jared!
Go Jared! A true inspiration. Keep us posed on your progress.
Jared‚Äôs gonna get swole af
WE ARE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU JARED!!! ‚ù§
Stories like this is why i get on reddit 
Tell Jared he could do a great Kylo Ren cosplay if he wanted to.
That's the look of a man who's stared death in the face and won.
sleep big
Your biggest waste of time was easily Dr. Phil
I liked Jared yesterday when he motivated me to work out. I like him a little less now that my whole  body is sore af today. Thanks Jared 
**This is before his Swolo legacy.**
I do believe he beat it. :)   But look at him, I don‚Äôt think even if he had cancer still that it would ever beat him! ;) 
Just remember what happened with the last Jared that got in shape. He went to high schools showing off his weight loss. 
GET IT MOTIVATOR
If he keeps it up he can be Ben Swolo
That's the look of a man who wants to follow in the steps of his grandfather and kill all Jedi.
He also kinda looks like Kylo ren 
Do everything big 
He is on reddit.
So much better than subway Jared 
Jared from Subway...his career ended as it started: trying to get into smaller pants
Not just all the Jedi  But the sand men, sand women & sand children too  
There's the look of a man.
I heard Kylo Ren has an eight-pack

my issue is I like to always try new hobbies so i never get good at anything. I always get super into a new hobby or idea then i get tired of it and do something else.
I practiced for years writing different styles of electronic compositions and I just can‚Äôt get good at it. It always sounds broken but then I met a guy who picked it up as a hobby and in less than a year, he was making professional sounding songs. Practice makes perfect but some people just see it differently. Not trying to sound like a cynic, just a bummer to see people be so good at something when my hundreds of hours of practice didn‚Äôt achieve much and now I‚Äôve lost that passion. 
I keep telling people that complement me on my ability to play multiple instruments that I was terrible for such a long time... and if you aren't okay with being terrible for 20 minutes every day for at least 2 years than you'll never stop sucking. I really had very little talent, I just loved it.
From my earliest memories, I drew.  I made comics and joined every art class my school had.  I got into college and kept myself in many art classes.  I was terrible at art.  My ability to stay motivated got me a science degree.  
So you‚Äôre telling me, instead of spending hours complaining how much I suck at certain tasks I could just practice those tasks and be pretty decent one day? That makes too much sense to make any sense.
"""Hardwork beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.""   One of my fav quotes."
I agree with this to an extent but there are kids who have a knack for drawing or singing or dancing or any number of other things.  I'm not saying that someone who practices can't be as good but it's absurd to deny that some people are gifted.
I feel thaf you must first have a real interest and a passion for the craft before you get down practicing. 
The problem is taking the first step.  Also, maintaining.
"Whenever I draw or talk about it I sometimes get the response ""oh, I can't draw"" or ""all I can draw is stick figures haha"". Like, same for me, but then I doodled over the years and developed an art style. No one unable to do it, it just takes practice.  It's the same thing for Smash Bros. Most of the time the winner is simply the most experienced player."
It's like a conversation with my 4 year old... That I've also had with co-workers. 
Maybe your actual hobby is starting hobbies and your badass at it.
"I get just good enough at my various crafty hobbies so that people who know nothing about them will be like ""Wow! You are so skilled!"" but anyone who has any experience with it would see that I have very basic skills."
I have the same problem. I get defeated when I‚Äôm not automatically good at something, so I give up. 
"the trick is to endure the pain and misery and suffering of failure at that point.  when you've reached a hump, you have to work to get over it tirelessly, sometimes locking yourself in a basement and not eating for days solely obsessed with your goal.  anyone can get over these humps, the question is time, desire, passion, drive...  if you say 'I'm not good at this' you'll give up playing an instrument, doing art, programming or any other hobby within a year or so -- as it becomes obvious your nowhere near at the level to actually compete...  but this is the thing -- you have to do it for the love of it. whatever it is. you have to want to get better JUST so you can do it. not so you can prove anything.  it has to be like beating a boss in a hard game like dark souls-- just 1000x more crushing.  because often times, the things you must learn to practice are the boring things far before you can have 'fun' (and eventually, fun becomes work when you CAN get there)  things like extreme small fine motor control, timing, logic, manipulation of math or data structures intuitively.  it becomes grind work. of sitting at a piano, listening to notes for 18 hours saying ""this is A"" ""this is b"", ""this is do, this is di"", and progressing to chords, etc.  it becomes hours of playing a guitar when you know you suck - redoing every measure over and over again until you nail it perfect 100% run no mistakes with a recording, analyzing every pick stroke, every attack, every single motion made.  the key is to say ""I suck, but EVERYONE sucked at this point"" and suck it up yourself and keep going.  I think being able, and willing to do that is what separates truly great people, and people who will succeed from those who dont.  some are able, but not willing and forced and find no passion in things -- no ingenuity, just cold, complacent interpretations of the work of others  not everyone has advantages early in life though, so its not always fair.  but if you really want to get at least to an intermediate level of most things -- all you have to do is not give up when that hump comes, give it your all without a break 18 hours a day until you win.   unfortunately the walls are just going to keep growing higher as you gain more skill. so your ability to continuously adapt decides if you will actually 'make it' in that area."
As a math tutor, I really try to drive this point home.
While there's some truth to this, let's also not pretend that differences in average intelligence don't exist, or that there aren't *effectively* minimums of varying levels for succeeding in many occupations.
Slow down there Einstein. Try English this time. Eli5 
There are two types of genius, the 'young savant' and the 'old master'.  Don't give up, become the old master.
"Reminds me of the old story about how someone goes up to a concert pianist and says, ""That was beautiful!  I'd give my life to be able to play like that!"" and the pianist goes, ""I did."" "
I use to hate that quote because I went from the smart kid to being close to failing classes. The quote just hit close to home and made me feel bad. Anyway, happy cakeday! 
There are also tons of naturally talented people not doing a thing with their talent because they don't practice.  There's always a limit to natural talent.  Which is what i try to remind myself when i suck lol everyone has to practice eventually
People disregard hard work as innate talent, and others confuse their innate talent with hard work.
"Oh hell yes. ""I wish I could draw like you, I can barely draw a stick figure"" but...do you really...do you really wish you could draw? If you enjoyed it. You'd do it. If you actually wanted it, you'd do it. You don't really wish you could do it. You just wish you possessed the magical ability to instantly create, like a 3D printer. And really you can draw. You just move your pencil on paper and draw what you see or imagine. It's just not well. Just like dancing. Dancing is just movement. Just move. Or don't. But don't pretend. They always have someone I wish I could posses an ability or skill or passion for too, but I don't go around saying I can only strum a few chords or only can tell when my sisters lying.  It's such a pet peeve of mine. Along with the ""why don't you sell those for money? What are you doing working here?"" ""Oh how much do you want this one for? $15? $25?"" ""Oh that's not really my style"""

You just broke my brain.  If he starts a hobby of starting hobbies, then, since he's good at starting hobbies, his hobby is starting hobbies of hobbies.... but then...  I'm too tired for this.
I‚Äôm like that but as soon as the topic is brought up, all the information is forgotten and I can‚Äôt contribute. Not very good at vocalizing opinions. 
"Ditto. People always say, ""You're so talented"". Nope. Mostly just interested and patient. My 'talent' is mostly their lack of perspective."
Sounds like perfectionism. I used to get so frustrated trying to learn guitar because I wasn‚Äôt getting things as fast as I thought I should. One day I just said, fuck it, I‚Äôm not gonna try to be the best, I‚Äôm just going to play for the sake of playing. It took the stress out of it, playing was fun again, and eventually [I got pretty okay at it.](https://i.imgur.com/3QYVuPn.jpg)

Well I'm halfway there.

"This reminds me of a parable my tai chi instructor told me:   Long ago in ancient China, a rich nobleman's son wanted to learn Shaolin kung fu. With great pomp and ceremony, he left his home and went to the temple. He met with the head monk, who agreed to let him study kung fu at the temple. The rich man shaved his head and donned the robes and was led to a room containing a well and a barrel of water. The monk told him to slap the surface of the water with his palm until no water remained in the barrel. The rich man didn't understand, but did as he was told. He slapped the water with his palm and a little water splashed onto the floor. He repeated the slapping for what seemed like hours until no water remained. He found the monk and told him he had finished. The monk instructed him to fill the barrel again and repeat the task. This scene repeated for days. Eventually, the rich son stopped going to the monk and just refilled the barrel without being told. He grew angry. He suspected he was the butt of a cruel joke, and that the monks would never teach him kung fu but he knew that if he returned to his family having only slapped water he would be a laughingstock. Eventually, the seasons changed and the rich son returned home for the holiday feast. His family was so proud of him for studying kung fu, even though he was secretly ashamed that he had not received even one day's instruction. ""What kung fu did you learn? What did they teach you?"" his family asked, eagerly. ""They didn't teach me anything,"" he mumbled. ""Oh, you are so modest, tell us what they taught you!"" they urged. The man grew enraged. ""They didn't teach me anything!"" he shouted, as he slammed his palm on the table, breaking it in half. "
Don't practice until you get it right. Practice until you can't get it wrong.
I mean, I‚Äôm not good at writing essays. I also choose to not get better because I hate writing essays lol
"No, most math teachers have NO IDEA how to teach math to average and below average kids. Thats why why we tend to say ""I'm not good at math"" when we grow up. When I matured I taught myself math, because my teachers, from k-12 only taught to the kids that had a natural inclination for it, the other 75% of us barely scraped by, at best.  Teaching is about communicating through engagement, not just forcing children to mindlessly do math problems. That has been my experience, ymmv."
"It's like the thing in karate kid. ""Wax on, wax off."""
I... I think I'm supposed to be practicing. I'll see you guys later... 
I hate writing essays too but I'm good enough at them now that people will pay me to teach them how. The secret is you can get a bunch of the skills you need for essay writing by doing other more enjoyable things like writing stories or reading books.

Ah yes but by the same token, my 2 sausage McMuffins this morning stand as a testement to A) the hard-earned money I pissed away and B) the beating my intestines can take on a friday afternoon.
Find a form of exercise that you enjoy and make it a habit. Having the mindset of exercise as punishment won't result in long term success.
Or it can be a celebration of what you‚Äôre about to eat.
One of the biggest things I have learned in life is to take great joy in movement. Wish I had caught on sooner and realized how lucky I was with my younger physique. 
Oh no. It is definitely punishment and I have been a baaaad boi

I spend 10 hours a day in an office so it's hard to find the motivation to go to the gym after a day at the office. It's also hard to wake up early because I like having free time after work to unwind.  I got a VR headset (Vive) back in February with my tax return because I was really hyped to try out VR games like Gorn, Pavlov, Onward, and H3VR. This last month, though, I've managed to regulate my diet once again and I've been doing my best to put in 30 minutes to an hour of Expert Beat Saber with No Fail mode on to keep moving. It really is more of a cardio workout than you'd expect, same deal with Gorn. I found what works for me by fusing my favorite hobby with exercise, and I've lost 8 pounds since the end of June, with no plan to stop soon. 
Yep. If I do my workout, I get to eat the sluttiest cheeseburger ever.   It's worth it. 
Switch to anywhere but McDonald's. I'm not even talking about the health reasons, be unhealthy all you like. I just strongly dislike the MCD as a restaurant. Feel the same way about Walmart. Also, why are fkn McDonald's and Walmart always right next to one another? Conspiracy or not, it makes it easier to avoid both of them. There. I'm done now.   Edited for clarity.
I used to think this then wondered why I wasn‚Äôt losing weight, my little four mile run could never burn off a big mac 
I used to live near a Walmart that had a McDonald's INSIDE, the conspiracy is definitely real
Those slow runners are out there for FAR LONGER than the fast runners. Six, seven hours of running. That‚Äôs a hard day.  Respect.
They were the last two **finishers**. Anybody that gave up came in behind them.
Better to finish last than to not try at all. Good for them!
Could have credited the original post OP  https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bli1os/the_last_two_runners_in_the_pittsburgh_marathon/
"I volunteered at one of the medical aid tents roughly halfway through the course and followed their progress over the radio net.   **The max time limit should have been enforced and they should have been swept by the bus (seen behind them) halfway through the race.** Nearly every med aid tent had to check on them. They hobbled past us looking very tired and we went to check. They held up the sweep bus, who carried all the *medical drop-outs* behind them. To be clear, all those people who left the race because of medical reasons were being stifled from follow-up care by these two.   They were *very* far back beyond all others. When we thought we were done for the day (started out there setting up/orienting at at 5:30am), we waited around an extra 40 minutes or so but checked on them and cheered them on as they passed.   Problem is...most of the roads were shut down in Pittsburgh well after they were done (which was like halfway into the afternooon). You could simply not get home if you lived even remotely close to any part of the marathon course or required roads close to it.   Downvotes incoming, but this is not ""perseverance,"" this is medical stupidity.  Edit 1: Thank you for my first silver ever, kind stranger!  Edit 2: Thank you for my *second* silver, kind stranger! And thank you everyone for having an open and honest conversation about this.  I'm all for pushing yourself, but when your stubborn sense of accomplishment becomes more important than not only your health but the well-being of others, it becomes a problem for everyone."
The lady in blue finished in 7 hours, 24mins, and change. I want see the last digit of the other's bib to verify it she finished. Considering the course was only supposed to be open for 7hrs  (I think), I find it awesome they have an official time. They must have kept the finish line mat set up longer.
Vote me down all you want but these women don't belong out there.  They are obese and not ready for a marathon.  They need to slim down, eat/drink clean, and train.  There is no way they ran a complete marathon.  There is no fucking way.
They say running a marathon is easier than walking it.
If they came in they are still finishers? What am I missing?
They‚Äôre still miles ahead of everyone on the couch.
Have run a marathon and then walked the last few km. Running is way easier. It‚Äôs just that your body sometimes is like ‚Äúhey, no more, ok?‚Äù And decides to stop working.
But still not as hard as scoring 5 touchdowns in 1 game in a high school football game, including the game-winning touchdown. It's true that some things can only be done once in human history.  **COMMENT ALTERATION #‚òùÔ∏è:** Tank you for your appreciation of my wisdom.

That said Pittsburgh also had a time limit so if these people are being acknowledged as the last they're probably the last ones going at a good enough pace to finish before that time
Title says last runners, but they surely past people who didnt finish.
Except for those who already finished the marathon and then sat down on a couch.
Running is definitely not easier.  There's a reason it burns more calories.
That may have been because you wore out your body over most of the race and then switching to a walk broke your rhythm long enough for the endorphins to thin out and the fatigue to fully set in. I‚Äôve hiked longer than a marathon distance in one go myself, but based on how the occasional 2-3 mile runs I go on feel I definitely can‚Äôt run a full marathon as I am.
This one hurt quite a bit
I've been there with hiking, fuck that. I thought I couldn't reach the summit, I just wanna sit down forever. Good thing my SO kept encouraging me that we were close.

I hadn't seen a single episode of The Simpsons, but this image made me watch it. Enjoying it so far.
I made this for my husband with pictures of our daughter. He has it in his office. It got some pretty good reactions from the co-workers.
Homer might be a dunce, but that man loves his family.  Nothing more noble than that
Doesn‚Äôt he have 2 other kids?
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs company policy to give you the Plague!‚Äù
Think this episode made me cry. That and the one with their wedding day. When comedy gets serious. 
Well... this comment shot up to the top and I saw it...
My grandmother thinks (and regularly comments on how) it‚Äôs a really clever show because of how many demographics it connects to. Also because it was the first adult-oriented cartoon series I think. 
golden age simpsons is truly a godsend
A great edit would be all the Maggie photos replaced with photos of your daughter!
Well you‚Äôve got a several hundred to go...it‚Äôs a great series 
https://imgur.com/a/biwvo
If I recall correctly, the episode this scene features in is where Homer explains to Bart and Lisa why they don‚Äôt have baby pictures of Maggie. As it turns out, before Maggie was born, Homer worked at the power plant (which he hated) but really wanted to quit and pursue his dream of working for the bowling alley. He eventually does quit but later finds out Marge is pregnant with Maggie. Due to financial problems, Homer has to let his bowling dream go and beg for his job back at the power plant to make ends meet (Mr Burns puts the plaque there to remind him that that‚Äôs his life now). When Lisa and Bart ask what the story has to do with the lack of photos of Maggie, Homer just says that the photos are where he needs them most, which turns out to be his workstation. So whilst he does have two other kids, Maggie is the thing that keeps him going when he goes to the place he hates most.
How about when his mom leaves again and hes just sitting on the hood of his car?
I know people hate on new episodes. But there‚Äôs one that allows the kids to grow so we see them succeed and act as adolescents and grown ups. I won‚Äôt give the ending or all the premise but I sobbed watching it when it first aired, immediately bought the digital copy, and cried again.   SPRINGFIELD FOREVER  Edit: episode is Barthood s27 e.9
For those who barely watch the simpsons, explain? Are the images here just a spoiler, or am I being wooshed?
The episode's older than half the people posting here. You still wondering whether those small folk managed to get that ring to the fires of Mordor?

It's heartwarming and at the same time funny when you think on those episodes homer forgets about maggie.
Awh the tune is so haunting too in the end credits!! That and the last day on earth for homer! Where he sits in the chair and listens to his tape recorder. 
"SPOILER: The image is from the end of a really sweet episode about homer deciding he has more life ambitions then power plant guy. he goes on a soul search and finds some thing he likes more but doesnt pay as well, he is happy but not rich. He finds out marge is pregnant and decides to give up on his happy easy job to go back to the plant and it really depressed until he meets his daughter. he then finds happiness in working at the plant because every day he gets to come in and see the smiling face of his daughet covering the sign that says ""dont forget youre here forever"" changing it to ""do it for her"""

I dont watch the Simpsons but have vague memory of this for some reason. Was it due to ingesting fish toxins by any chance? 
I think it‚Äôs the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen on The Simpsons. Definitely by Homer. 
His life ambition was to work as a pin jockey in a bowling alley, BTW.  (He was great at it.)  He made just enough to make it with two kids, but not three.  His quitting scene early in the episode was epic (he actually burned a bridge on his way out of Springfield Nuclear.)
...in a double episode where the first ended with Burns being shot, and the second one was about finding the shooter. To make it even more unbearable, the first episode was the season 6 finale while the second one was the season 7 premiere.

As an Airbnb user, I've always thought it was just fine. What were your issues?
Having spent eight years at 25+ year old companies and just now joining a start up, I can see why. It's been amazing (so far)
Wow look at this comment I noticed!
Also curious what the issues are.  I use Airbnb almost exclusively and love it.  Compared to the traditional hotel setup it's a joy.
There were no issues. Just an average Joe who wants to jump on the ‚Äúhate big company‚Äù band wagon 
I've not had any issues either.  Used it twice domestically and once internationally.  All were great. 
Wrong. The best episode is all of them back to back in one long run.
Lol same. It's literally just other peoples houses all over the world. Considering how fucking expensive hotels are it's my first resort.
They had us in the first half, not gon lie
It‚Äôs literally just a hotel chain at this point. Where I live, it‚Äôs been destroying rental stock and everyone who has to live in buildings with AirBnB suites all hate it.  The majority of the suites aren‚Äôt even other people‚Äôs homes. Many of them are owned by management groups. People have been evicted from rentals under the guise of the homeowners needing it back, only to see it reposted on AirBnB illegally.   Apartments are being exposed to more thefts now that Airbnb owners are just mass cloning keys and fobs, and handing them out like candy.  And the vast majority of them probably aren‚Äôt even reporting their incomes.  
"""Why are you on pornhub?""  ""For the articles."""
This may be true, but I'll be damned if I tell my crush years down the road when we're married with kids, that a pornhub comment is what finally gave me the courage to ask her out. 
Its a strange thing type after you have just fapped off but it is very true none the less.
If she says yes what the fuck do i do then i did not plan that far.
When I was in college 9 years ago I always saw this beautiful girl in cafeteria. I always would plan on talking to her but always pussied out. In the spring semester I was going through a shitty time....failing all my classes, no job, post break up with another girl. I said fuck it thinking I had nothing to lose, and decided to talk to her.  We've been together now for 9 years, married for three, and have a baby girl on the way.  It always gives me a stomach ache thinking what if I didn't have the balls to talk to her that one day. I don't know where I'd be today without her.
Ok what if she says no, the depression is crippling, you drink to forget about her. But you're too drunk you've lost your phone and all reason has left you, just like her. Sitting at the bar you're forced to leave. You stumble to your car in drunken stupor. You fumble with the keys, she liked keys. She probably had a car too but it's too late now you can't change her mind. You finally creak open the car door. Your phone was in it the entire time. You pick it up it's a photo of her. The one that'll never be. In a drunken rage you through it. Anger overcomes you, you get into the car crank the engine and peel out of the parking lot. You swerve across the road narrowly missing trash cans and street lights. Until bam you hit another car. You crawl out of the wreckage to see if the other driver's ok. Feelings of drunken regret wash over you. You get closer. It's her, she was the other driver. You scream in horror. What have i done you shout. Then you get closer try to pull her out and and, her mask falls off. It was john cena.
Why are you making me feel things inside? I'm trying to jerk off here!
Ah, Pornhub. First teaching me acting and now teaching me life lessons.
I had my first date last month. I'm 20 years old and I never had a first date until just this year. I was in a long distance relationship for four years and never had a real date honestly. My friend hooked me up with her and I went to New York by train to meet her. I hung out with her, we went to a park, I paid for lunch for the both of us, she showed me around her college campus, we did all of that while walking in 90+ degree weather. We had a nice time. But then right before we departed and I went home, she told me she couldn't see me anymore and she doesn't want to date me. It took everything it had in me to not cry on the train.  There's nothing I want more than to feel loved by someone, and in return, make someone feel like they're loved. I hate being alone. I hate being single. I'm not really an attractive guy, and I don't even think I'll get a girl anytime soon. But I think one day, I'll get someone. One day. I don't know when. I don't know how. And I don't know why they would choose me. But I'm sure that one day, hopefully, I'll finally land the right person for me.

You know it's the right one when you're comfortable with sharing Pornhub wisdom
There's a japanese term called Kenja Taimu, meaning wiseman's time (or philosopher's time). It's right after a man orgasms when he's truly free of involuntary sexual desires and can rise above to become a being of deep wisdom and meditation. Sometime accompanied by guilt of having given into such lowly of desires.  Tragically this time lasts only minute or two, and a man is doomed to walk the same path over and over. 
Seriously tho can you guys help me brainstorm second date ideas and teach me how to be charming
There's a girl at work I've wanted to talk to for a few months but have been too afraid for some reason, I'm finally gonna do it tomorrow, thanks man.  Edit: So I wake up today with confidence (which isn't the norm) and one thing on my mind, talking to this girl. I got to work and realized she wasn't scheduled to work today. I did check to confirm that she is working tomorrow. The wind was let out of my sails slightly but I did decide to talk to some other girls just for the hell of it.
And then John Cena turns his big beautiful eyes to look at you. One last time.

Hey you chose to open the comment section, dont put that on him!
I saw a comment the other day where a guy asked if anyone wanted to make a castle in mine craft with him, he got a lot of replies.
Lol are you me?  Met this cool girl recently. She'd ask me to go to lunch and walk to the park with her and stuff. We'd talk a lot, and when we depart she'd text me a lot too. Silly me interpreted this as her being interested in me so I asked her out, and got rejected.  Things were awkward for a while but it didn't last long. We're still friends, but things are definitely different now compared to before I asked her out. It just sucks that I have to get over a girl I wasn't even in a relationship with.
It's what we all really get off to when we go to the site. Pornhub comment section is golden... I mean i've never been there before.... 
can we get r/pornhubwisdom?
It makes sense. When do men have the most clarity of thought? After rubbing one out.
As the squirting milf soaked my face sodden, I felt my sorrow too, dripping from my hair and my eyes, staining my shirt. I did not reach for an umbrella, for to block the stream shooting my face would be to deny my sorrow. The squirting milf was there, squirting me with her vagina, an endless stream of doubts and questions... who was I to question her purpose?
At first I thought you were playing with me, then i just looked it up. Thats a damn interesting thing you just shared there bro, thanks for sharing that one man
Just imitate pierce brosnan, not in James Bond, but the pierce from mrs. doubtfire
Get to know her. Personally, although food can be fun and a simple ice breaker, I prefer to get to know someone through an activity so you don't awkwardly stare at each other. One of my best dates, I was taken to one of those indoor trampoline parks and had a blast being goofy. It can bring out a natural, fun personality. 
Please update us!
But you can't see him. You never could.
Be the change
/r/writingprompts? Are you leaking again?

No, but the squirting milf is.

What was your position at Apple?
"""Sharing information is a good thing""  Apple seems to have changed quite a bit. From what I understand, the company is extremely silo-ed. I have friends who tell me employees aren't allowed to discuss their work with colleagues outside of their project groups and even access to buildings is highly restricted.  "
OMG when I joined Apple they gave me one of these as well. One year at our national sales conference I had my badge on and the stupid lanyard broke and I lost the card, and JB had already left the company. Been looking for this for AGES but no one ever knows what I‚Äôm talking abut. Thank you for this!! 
"honestly for some reason the first line really hit me. I think too much about the things I do wrong and I torture myself trying to criticize all of the mistakes I made when it's stupid for me to be concerned about stuff in the past. It's smarter to just say ""oh well"" and move on rather than grinding your teeth at your past failures."
Everyone sweeps the floor can't be more on point. I work in the restaurant industry and I can't tell you the number of times I've seen a sous chef have to wash dishes because the porter decided not to show up.
"[John ""JB"" Brandon](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2001/06/06John-Brandon-Joins-Apple-as-Vice-President-of-the-Americas-and-Asia-Pacific/)   He was a great guy in my interactions with him, despite his lofty position relative to my total-noob status back then. He really seemed to live by these rules and made the whole organization feel like something really special, even when Apple was still climbing out of ""beleaguered"" status. "

No kidding. Removing the socket to make the phone thinner. No one is asking for a thinner phone. They're asking for a phone with a battery that lasts more than a fucking day.
Duh. They removed the headphone jack because headphones are distracting so it's harder to listen to the customer. 
"I took it as a little more than its literal meaning. You aren't ""too good"" for any task that you're given or that needs to be done for the business - be it sweeping the floors, taking notes, cleaning up spreadsheets, etc."
I spent ~7 years as an Apple Solutions Consultant, aka the full-time Apple corporate employee stationed inside the Mac area at CompUSA (and later Best Buy). It was a largely forgotten role that faded out as the Apple Stores blew up, but for the first few years I loved it. I had all the perks of being an Apple employee (prestige, experience, discounts, trips to HQ, etc.), while also being largely autonomous in how I ran my business. I made some lifelong friends, learned a TON about retail operations and general business practices, and I miss it quite often. I make more money and have way more stability in my current non-Apple office job, but there was a thrill that came with the ASC role that was hard to explain. 
"Something I learned my first day working in a call center for a company whom works with car dealers; there is a giant difference between the ""customer"" and the ""consumer"". "
They just share all our information instead...
I like his win/win pointer with partners.  As an Apple partner that rule seems to have slipped a bit over the years.  
"*""People don't know what they want until you show it to them.""*  ‚Ä¢ Jteve Bobs"
Yeah, nothing to do with the wireless headphone company they acquired shortly beforehand.   And it wasn't possible to have *both* Bluetooth *and* a headphone jack. They would have been asking for the moon.   And everyone knows customers want a thinner phone. It's not like the number one complaint has always been battery life. 
As it happens, the phone didn't get any thinner when the headphone jack was removed but did get a bigger battery. Do you ever stop to consider the things you are thinking before you say them?
So you were the Genius forefather - nice. 
Nah, that's Google's job.
They also force ridicule price on 3rd party seller. I was working as a student in a mall in belgium and they showed me the price apple was selling iphones to them : to sell at msrp they made less than 1‚Ç¨ by iPhone ( around 700‚Ç¨) and they said it was more of a calling product because usually people buy a case alongside the phone. Moreover, they couldn't choose when and what to be delivered by apple, apple won't sell iPhone if you don't agree. So sometimes they were out of iPhone for 5 month, sometimes they received a shitload of old iPhone they had trouble selling. The management were hesitating about completely selling them.  Edit: Calling product == Loss leader
I sense a meme abrewin'.
I took it somewhere completely different; I don't think Snape redeemed himself when he died, and he was still a monster of a human being that made life hell for pretty much everyone he came in contact with. 
No I don't mind at all, that's totally fine. 
> calling product  Is that like what we call a 'loss leader' over here in the states?
[Chinese factories making apple products have installed nets in and outside the building to catch people who throw themselves off the building to commit suicide.](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2010/11/tl201009-foxconn56.jpg)  EDIT: Apple is not evil. The point of this was to illustrate one way in which they have slipped from their goal of *furthering positive relationships* with its partners. They have since taken action to better address the needs of their foreign workforce.
Anone who has sold phones knows you get essentially nothing out of the phone deal, sometimes even selling at a loss. The money is in additional purchases like a new operator or a case.
To be fair, Foxconn doesn't just make Apple stuff, it makes just about everyone's electronics stuff.
Meh, sometimes people like it when you're funny on Reddit, sometimes they don't. It's not always easy to see how the winds are blowing.
That's mental 
A lot of tech sales are like this honestly. I work at a store that sells office supplies and our computers are literally sold at a loss. If we don't get the protection plan, or some kind of software, accessory, bag, router, you name it attached, we lose money on the sale
So if I don't buy the protection plan, then I really fucked your company over...but thanks!
This is me at the moment. After a year of convalescence and putting on 25kg in that year, I started exercising 2 weeks ago. Walk, jog, walk, jog and so on. The improvement has been rapid. I Did 7km in 40 minutes today. 
Thank you for this. I've been in rough shape for almost two weeks due to some back pain and some days my only extra movement is pacing the kitchen in 5 to 10 minute increments throughout to keep from sitting or laying down all day.  It's frustrating but remembering that some effort is better than no effort is both physically and emotionally rewarding.
This has been circulating the internet for so long, I wouldn't be surprised if that guy is down to his ideal weight already.
"I love these pictures, I wish I had saved the first one from Nike where they had the overweight guy jogging and the saying ""One day or Day One"".   Posts like these are what helped me get to where I am at today losing over 40lbs. In just under 3 months and working towards losing 50 more.  I now sometimes catch myself chuckling when I do my daily runs. "
Damn straight! Ignore everyone else and just stay consistent and get after it ....good things will happen.
Awesome work dude! Keep it up!
Good job. Keep it up. Do it for you. I dropped 40 lbs and got hooked on just the general good mood I was in on days that I exercised versus the stretches where I skipped them. Focus on that good feeling rather than the number on the scale or anything else really.
You're absolutely right, I've been there last month myself.
AMA, this guy? Where are you?
This is me too, first day came home on my knees after 3 miles, 2 weeks later I'm crawling home on my knees after 5 miles.  Now i'm laying on the floor [watching this on the net&chill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4V_6-D3L40)
Yep, I know exactly what you mean. I am not a morning person, never have been.  But one day, I pushed myself to wake up at 7am to go to the gym.  That whole rest of the day, I felt like I did some sort of drug like ecstasy. I felt fucking incredible. 
in their kitchen ?!
He's too busy lapping us
And in a 6 months, if you keep it up, you'll be running 5 miles and be wondering if you should add another few just to pass the time before dinner
And you'll think marathoners are insane to want to be out there running for 4+ hours but in another year you're hitting the mile 20 wall and realizing that yup, you were right, marathoners are insane, but now you're one of them. 
"""Some motherfuckers are always trying to ice skate uphill""   -Wesley Snipes "
Yes!!!! This is why I call social media the 'highlight reel' no one is posting their failures but everyone is comparing themselves to everyone's best moments which is a great way to get down on yourself. Definitely a dangerous path. Spot on Wesley Snipes.
I don't know. Some failures are more taxing than others...
Not true, my mom posts pictures of me on Facebook sometimes. 
its very motivating to click on a youtube channel, see how terrible quality their videos are and how low their view count is  then click on their latest video and see how much they improved. so sometimes i look for failure on the internet, cause you get to see how they improved and thats inspiring
Should we start FailBook where it's just the ultimate dystopia of social media?

Try HateBook, the anti-social media where, instead of getting friends, you get enemies. I suppose you can also post your failures too.

I would like to share his instagram where I took the photo from but not sure if its agains the rules. This dude is truly an inspiration to me and hopefully he'll be to you too
I remembered when he was first posted about on here. Been following his Instagram ever since. Seeing his growth is amazing!
I'm glad he's alive but as someone who has been at very low body fat before, I can only assume the struggle is still real. 
0% bodyfat would mean he's dead. 
He still looks incredibly thin. I don't know much about lung cancer, and obviously he didn't have a lot of meat on his bones to start with, but does he look unhealthy? Not knocking his progress at all, this is great for him, I am just curious
If you crack wise about anybody at the gym, you are trash.
Very impressive. But it's physically impossible for anyone to be at zero percent body fat lol. I wonder who told them that
Did anyone else think that one bar of scaffolding or whatever was coming out of his chest when you first saw the right picture.
Fuck the rules, just share it. Tell this guy others are proud of him, too.
He has cystic fibrosis not lung cancer... 
You should listen to his endless thread interview. Not bad. 
I m a skinny guy too and struggling a lot with weight-gain. I can only imagine how difficult it would have been for him with his illness.
It really is man but this is just the start for him!
Was about to ask is 0% even physically possible? I understand like 1.5-2% or some shit
His IG says he has CF. Not sure if he also had lung cancer or if they confused diseases?
In middle school this kid marked himself on the face with a marker and then raised his hand , when called upon he told the teacher I did it and I got reprimanded. It caught me off guard, the betrayal, the injustice I've never let it go. 10 years later I see him at the gym a few days a week and I scorn him inwardly but show no outward disdain. What are your thoughts on this hellraiser, Am I a bad guy? Should I let it go? 
You are right. His ig is Wellsy351, his name is Jared show him some love guys he deserves it

Ice cream after dinner every night. Whipped cream on everything, even cereal. It's hard, I hate sweets and dairy, but it works. Just make sure if you don't process dairy that well, that you also eat a lot of yogurt. That zing taste in yogurt is lactase, which helps break down lactic acid before it ferments into sugars in your gut and causes all that pain and acid shits. It helps, a lot. I go through a gallon of icecream every 4 days. But I've gotten to see the far side of 180 twice despite my autoimmune disease and my digestive tract damage. 
> I understand like 1.5-2% or some shit  Even that is going to be fatal. Guys like Andreas Munzer dont make it to 40 for a reason and theyre usually hovering around 3-4% for just a few years before they die.
Just over emphasis but it doesn‚Äôt change the fantastic transformation 
Well, CF would make sense for the leanness...
Bruh it‚Äôs middle school, and it was 10 years ago. Are you really gonna let that bother you? 
No, no he wasn't. If he was, he wouldn't have given such specific measurements for his arms, ect.  The pattern of speech used was <specific>, <specific>, <specific>. Not <specific>, <specific>, <hyperbole>.
I've been following him since that first post. It's been incredible to not only see the physical change but to even be able to see the mental change in him through his posts. He has been a huge inspiration to me these past months üôÇ Thank you for helping him! 
"Just looked up Andreas Munzer.  >""Some of the specific autopsy findings were an extremely muscular physique with an almost complete absence of subcutaneous fat, a liver that contained numerous table tennis ball-sized tumors (with half the liver consisting simply of a crumbly mass that was similar to polystyrene), shriveled testes, and cardiac hypertrophy (M√ºnzer's heart weighed 636g; a normal man's heart usually weighs 300‚Äì350g).""  Good God."
This is so embarrassing....but um...whats CF?
Yes, next question.
Hey man Im not the person who has been helping him. I just saw a post about him a year ago and Ive been following his progress which really is a motivation for me so I wanted to share üòÅ
Think about that liver for a second. Its an organ, it's almost always wet and has fluid in it. Imagine it *crumbling* like styrofoam. Good lord.
Oh. My body hurt reading that. I can literally feel my organs rejecting those ideas...
Cystic fibrosis affects the lungs, and causes a lot of systemic body issues. If this kid has c.f. and looks like that he must be incredibly driven. The life expectancy is pretty low, but most folks make the best of it. Edit for spelling
I believe they‚Äôre talking about Cystic Fibrosis
One of symptoms of CF is pancreas dysfunction, which can lead to malabsorption. Being underweight due to that can actually make it a lot harder for them to breathe as well as giving them less of a reserve in times of illness (which happen more often) so CF experts often recommend very high calorie diets to try to maintain the weight.   Like, a cystic fibrosis patient might be recommended to eat double what someone else of their gender/height is recommended. Otherwise, if they're underweight, it has been shown to reduce what lung function they do have.  Looking at the guy in the OP, if he's not underweight he's still not in the high normal/low overweight range where he should really try to be.  TLDR: Brother is still probably too skinny and really should probably eat more.
Since it wasn't mentioned, the monkey is shown jogging ~~with a partner in the opening credits for the first season~~ alone in many of the establishing shots for BoJack's house. He is never named, and does not appear in any other scenes.   During ~~the second season (when this occurs)~~ a flashback he is shown running with a partner in the background. It's speculated that she was his wife and that she died.  Show is BoJack Horseman.  Edits: My memory was slightly off - credit to /u/St_Veloth for the correction. Hopefully I haven't misled too many!
This show is a roller-coaster of laughter, tears, and motivation. 
This whole show is fantastic 
Turns out, the monkey is right.  I've never seen the show, but this was posted back in Sept '17 and it resonated with me. Joined a gym and lost 30lbs since. When people ask me how I lost the weight, I repeat this quote.  
"This scene answers the question from earlier that Bojack can't seem to figure out:  > ""I don't understand how people live. It's amazing to me that people wake up every morning and say 'Yeah, another day, let's do it'. How do people do it? I don't know how.""      That's how. You do it every day, and it gets a little easier."
I started watching BoJack Horseman for a good laugh, but after a while everything just got so deep! There are plenty of episodes that had me in tears. I love this show so much.
One day i sat on the bench and started thinking about, how i need to change my job, my life and my habits, start working out eating healthy. And you know what i am never sitting on this bench again. Fuck this bench. 
As someone who‚Äôs training for an 8K charity run coming up, this is completely true. Every day I run, my time gets better. It sucks, but it does get easier. Before losing 80 lbs, I could barely run 300 feet (no joke.) Now, my 5k is around 28 minutes. It gets easier. 
r/bojackhorseman and r/getmotivated in the same post? What is this a crossover episode?!
"""I'm gonna take a shower so I can't tell whether or not I'm crying"""
This quote is quite literally one of the main things that helped me beat my anxiety and mental illness, and it's absolutely true.  I plan to have it tattooed on me once I get the money.  Living is difficult, but getting started is the hardest part; every day it gets easier to do it the next.
That little detail made me more sad than it should have when I noticed
"I love this show and I love his scene with a particular passion. The monkey is something that appears in establishing shots of the outside of the main character's - Bojack, the horse- house in almost every episode. I like little things like that and when my wife and I were binging I took the time to look for him and point him out every time he turned up. Then, in this episode, which is a season finale, Bojack starts to jog I was like, ""oh will he meet Monkey Friend??"" And then not only does Monkey Friend turn up, but he drops THIS giant truth bomb on us? Coming at a particularly difficult time in my life as well, this scene hit me very hard. "
Jesus.... I never knew/realized that.    Holy shit, that just got a lot darker, and waaaaaay more real than I wanted.
"Almost.   He‚Äôs not in the opening credits, and he‚Äôs not shown with a running partner.  He often runs by during establishing shots of Bojacks house, before we cut to see what‚Äôs happening inside.   He‚Äôs always shown running outside up the hill outside Bojacks house alone. One episode takes place during a flashback and the establishing shot in the flashback is when he runs by with his assumed wife.   edit: And no worries I just didn't want it to turn it another 80% correct reddit fact like scrubs ""Janitor doesn't exist the first season"". That stuff irks me!"
"Here is another wonderful quote from the show.      ""It‚Äôs not about being happy, that is the thing. I‚Äôm just trying to get through each day. I can‚Äôt keep asking myself ‚ÄòAm I happy? ‚Äò It just makes me more miserable. I don‚Äôt know If I believe in it, real lasting happiness, All those perky, well-adjusted people you see in movies and TV shows ? I don‚Äôt think they exist.""       "
I always wanna rewatch but I'm terrified watching all four seasons in one go will destory me emotionally
I have had my own struggles with clinical depression.  This show is probably the best representation of the struggle I've seen on TV.  ************SPOILERS**************  Princess Caroline having the miscarriage hit my wife and I especially hard because that had happened to us two years ago.  But don't be sad for us.  We have a beautiful and healthy baby girl.  So happy ending finally.  We just got there the hard way.  EDIT:  This seems to have attracted some attention.  [So look at my beautiful daughter and feel happy.](https://i.imgur.com/WvMwehs.jpg)  EDIT2:  I've received some PMs about giving me gold.  Don't give me gold. Pay it forward. Donate to your local volunteer Fire Department or EMS. Buy a stranger lunch. Do something nice for someone else. You never know who it really needs a helping hand.  Find someone in your life who needs help and give it to them.
"For dieting and exercise this is 100% it.  I used to tell myself out loud while getting ready for the gym ""I don't want to do this"" ""I am tired"" ""I want to watch TV"" ""i want to eat pizza"" ""i want to lay down"" ""I don't want to go to the gym"" and then i would go to the gym.  Every statement was true but i knew that going to the gym is what i needed to do not what i wanted to do."
"> but after a while everything just got so deep!      Here is a quote from the show.      ""I spend a lot of time with the real me and believe me, nobody‚Äôs gonna love that guy.""      Damn you are right. "
‚ÄúWhen you look at someone through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags‚Äù
Horsin' Around
Bojack Horseman
Oh great so the show is even more depressing. 
"Bojack Horseman is one of the best shows i've ever seen.  I was suggesting stuff to watch to ""buddies"" during a dinner and this particular douche started laughing when i was explaining how fucking awesome the show is. He genuinely thought bojack was some kind of family guy bullshit and wouldn't change his mind. What can i do, live in your ignorance i guess my dude?"
"What I also love about this scene is BoJack's matter of fact ""okay"" in response to this.  We see that maybe BoJack is kinda beginning to get ""it,"" which is a pretty huge departure from the BoJack we've seen for most of the show.  This point hits particularly hard because it is also quite literally the last scene in Season 2.  "
> that just got a lot darker  This is Bojack we're talking about. It's all dark.
"Another gem from the show, ""The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning, its just to keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually you'll be dead."""
Thanks a lot for this. Can you please share the episode and season?
Man I love so many of Diane‚Äôs lines. I know it‚Äôs stupid but this show really helped turn around my depression. 
No! Sometimes snippets of certain sad shows have uplifting moments. This happens to be one of them.  Embrace it üëç
Season 3, Episode 3. Great episode for quotes. Here‚Äôs another from the same episode:  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to tell you. I‚Äôm happy for the first time in my life and I‚Äôm not gonna feel bad about it. It takes a long time to realize how truly miserable you are and even longer to see it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy‚Äù
It‚Äôs not stupid. This entire show is largely about dealing with depression and just the ugly side of life in general. The escapist environment with all the anthropomorphic animals and off-the-wall humor is meant to contrast with the rest of the show‚Äôs cynical and depressingly dark material.
> Sometimes snippets of certain sad shows have uplifting moments.  Ie life
"It's a show I struggle with personally. I love it, I really do, but as the seasons pass I find my love for it fading.   I used to suffer from depression. Now I manage it, and I'm in a very good place. I can honestly say, I'm happy, but more than that I'm joyful.  Bojack does absolutely nothing to bring joy into his own life. And he does EVERYTHING wrong that someone with depression can do wrong.  Then I come on Reddit and see how people, tons of people, make the claim that you can't just ""get over"" depression. They act like it's hopeless and there's nothing you can do. Shows like bojack show a hero who feels that way, and I think in those people's minds he just further reinforces that very wrong concept that you can't do anything to deal with depression besides hope medication works.  As I see more and more people around me fall into a cycle of depression, laziness, and apathy, each one feeding each other like some twisted Cerberus, it makes me cynical of shows like bojack. Shows that just perpetuate the idea that when you fall into that cycle you can't get out."
Btw Vincent adultman and Kevin have different freckle patterns 
But isn't that what the show is saying? As a viewer, I can see all the bad decisions he's making, and it's because of those decisions he's depressed.

Just watch TNG if you want to get motivated. Picard is the finest man who ever lived.

Now that‚Äôs some spicy motivation. 
Yeah I think it was called Peak Performance
Some people think Picard some kind of square but he's just a class act all over, I think.   It's why I love the episode where we learn about his artificial heart and how his flaws when he was younger make him the man he is in the present.   Such a good show.

People's passion for Star Trek makes me wish I liked Star Trek. I remember catching a couple of the movies on TV as a kid and there's some fuzzy memories of sitting in the living room watching some episodes of The Next Generation, but it didn't hook me as a little kid and I never went back to watch it when I might've been more inclined to actually absorb some of the themes of the show.  I feel like it's too late now, I dunno how well it holds up. 
"That was a fun episode. I started downloading and listening to Star Trek TNG from Netflix while I drive for work, I'm about to clear out seasons 6 and seven next week and roll on into Voyager. I have to say, I dig Trek much more than I thought I would. Shame, as I loved Futurama and Firefly and other ensemble ""tackle the theme of the week and learn a lesson"" shows but I just never got a start on watching Trek until a few weeks ago."

I would say Next Generation is definitely worth watching. It is a great show and if you like quotes in this thread, that‚Äôs a majority of what the show is. If you need an episode to see if it‚Äôs for you, one of my favorites is ‚ÄúMeasure of A Man‚Äù from I think the second season. You don‚Äôt need a lot of background info, and it‚Äôs not too far in that you lose much. 
If you go back to watch TNG don't be thrown off by the camera quality in the first season. You can tell that they're a bit under funded and still trying to find their rhythm but you shouldn't skip it by any means.  Star Trek was a very political show and still holds up, surprisingly a lot of their topics are even more applicable than some previous years.   Some of the effects will look a bit dated as well but it was never a big space action show like the newer movies are so its not as in your face. 
Skipping DS9?  That's a shame.  Either way, check out The Orville... TNG feel, just with parody (mostly for copyright reasons it seems)
Hnnnnng yeah
I... need an adult? 
I am an adult 
What the fuck are you doing here then. 
Yes! Love this. Sometimes I feel awkward being a first time college student in my 30‚Äôs. Intending on going on to law school. Assuming all goes as planned, I‚Äôll be 39 when I get my degree. Whenever I have those moments of insecurity about my age I just remind myself I‚Äôm going to be 39 regardless so I may as well enjoy the age AND have the degree.   Edit: so great to read everyone‚Äôs personal stories that are so similar to mine! Thanks for the conversation and motivation today. You‚Äôve all made my day! 
My grandmother went back to school at 62 and earned her bachelors in.... something.  I forget, she‚Äôs dead, but she always believed education as our saving grace and I‚Äôm inspired by her motivation.
I got a degree in 7 years!  It's not a race, glad it's done.  Edit: 7 years to get my BA  Undignosed arhd made it take 5 years to get my AA.   Diagnosed, therapy, and medication it took me 2 years to finish my BA and I was student of the year and won a couple awards.
My 60 year old wife graduated from high school this year,she is so proud.She is the only member of her family to graduate.
I just finished my study at age 26. I started 3 years ago. Everyone around me was already done or studying more difficult things.  I always felt behind, a failure. However finally I feel like it is ok. Yes I started later and am did a study that is not difficult learning wise for me.   But I managed to get a grip on my anxiety disorder. I managed to actually attend school and I have grown so much since the days I was locked up in my student dorm to scared to come out. To scared to get food incase anything might happen.  I got a job where I am doing good. It may take longer, but I have learned so much more.   Thank you for this post it is spot on.   Edit: thank you all for the kind respondses! 
"I still don't understand what an overpriced car has to do with personal success. Regardless of how much money I have, just give me a reliable Honda or even better, a reliable bus route that runs every 10-15 minutes so I don't have to deal with parking, traffic, and paying attention to the road, and I'm happy. The car companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year to make people think that spending too much on a metal box on wheels is what ""success"" looks like, and it's all quite silly."
i didn't get my high school credits the traditional way, as i had quit at 16. got the ged at 30 and didn't graduate junior college til i was 53, so it is very easily done no matter when it's begun
But I want to be rich, while I‚Äôm still beautiful.
A virgin at 40 is still a virgin!
I'm currently at a stage where I feel well behind most others my age (22). I haven't studied, don't have experience in any field other than hospitality, and I really can't see myself getting far.  I've been debating going back to uni, I know I can get in and I know what I want to do. But I'm just so scared of failing. What happens if I spend 4-6 years at uni, being a broke uni student, taking on a large debt; just to fail/not get a job in my field?  So unsure of what to do. 
Graduated with a bachelors degree last year age 55! First in my family to graduate from college.  You are awesome for doing it! Best of luck to you. 
I finished my undergrad degree from UC San Diego in my 30s!  It‚Äôs strange being in a classroom with 18-21 year olds, but challenging and rewarding for the ‚Äúold‚Äù brain :).  Keep up the strong work!
I find it weird that it‚Äôs a common belief that you should be done with college at 22 or around that age. If you go to college for wisdom/knowledge shouldn‚Äôt it be common to go throughout your life? I think we need to change the stigma around that kind of thinking. 
"""in...something. I forget, she's dead"". What a sudden twist of feels."
8 years for me on and off but I'm free now! 
It's about goals. Some people just have a dream car that they'd like to own some day. There's nothing wrong with that.
People who actually try in college rarely fail. 99% of droppouts dont go to class or actually put in the effort 
I‚Äôm one of the first in my family with a degree! I‚Äôve just gotten the associates and transferred into Penn State to finish the rest :) majority of my family members have GED‚Äôs. I‚Äôm really stoked that I finally managed to get over the hurdle of thinking I couldn‚Äôt. College is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love it! 
Not only that, but a lot of people who go to college at age 17 or 18 aren‚Äôt sure what they want to major in or aren‚Äôt ready to jump into something that will impact the rest of their life. College is a huge decision and we also need to change this stigma for that reason.

"Flunked out of uni the first time, tried to do it by distance education and discovered marijuana at the same time, not a great combination. Still remember opening a crap assignment I'd mailed in that the faculty head had scrawled ""I'M NOT MARKING THIS RUBBISH"" across in red pen.  Went back aged 30, won the third year scholarship, won first class honours, opened a returned assignment from the hardest marker in the faculty to find that he'd given me a 95, then obviously had second doubts that a student could even score this high with him, and got it reduced to a 90 with a crossmarker. There I was, 33 years old, holding and envelope and doing a happy dance in my loungeroom.  You guys can do it too."

‚ÄúSuch a fine sunny day, but I have to go...‚Äù   Love that line. 
We won, Sophie.
I think the unfortunate thing about this is her voice really was one of very few.  There really wasn't much meaningful resistance within Germany, even if plenty didn't like what was happening.  Had there been, it wouldn't have ended up as a 'world war.'
How do these people come up with such eloquent and thought provoking speeches with death at their door?
Someone just warned me against protesting the Nazis if they show up in my town. They can fucking shove it. You show up with Swastikas, and you better believe I'm going to have something to say.  Edit:  This is the article I was referring to. The way it showed up on Facebook which I can't show for obvious reasons made it not really clear where the event was going to take place. Until of course you clicked on the article.  https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2018/07/23/white-nationalists-alt-right-rally-washington-charlottesville/796998002/
The more i read about this Hitler guy, the less i like him. 
I had no idea....  https://timeline.com/sophie-scholl-white-rose-guillotine-6b3901042c98?gi=26cce6550ed6   Such a strong woman at such a young age. And her brother too. She is a martyr
Bill and Ted got it right. Party on dudes! Be excellent to each other!
We have the same haircut. I'm glad I can share that with this badass 
But probs in German  
That haircut is so 2018. Was she a time traveler?  Did someone actually go back and stop the Holocaust otherwise we would all be slaves today?
What a fine example of someone‚Äôs life which did truly matter. What a fine and extraordinary human being. 
Her sacrifice was made in the spirit that you might realize you are capable of exactly as much bravery. 
I üíì love your comment. And I love Sophie.   My family is from Poland. Only my greatgrandfather, gradnfather, and grandfather's sister survived. Fled to Argentina after my great grandfather received a tip of the impending trouble. Great grandma and rest of the fam didnt beleive him. They were sent to aushwitz and never heard from again. Before the nazis came, he took his two kids and fled Poland. We've never been back. They settled in Buenos Aires only to find out that it was nazi occupied and they hated jews there also. So he changed our last name from a very jewish one to a german sounding one. I still have the fake German last name. And all our family history has been pretty much erased other than the story that is passed down from my grandpa. My grandpa is 90 now and the nicest man i ever met. He does not like to talk about losing his mom and the rest of his family. Ive tried but he seemed to not want to discuss anything. The younger generations are the ones to pass the story along. He just smiles and loves food.   Anyway, Thank God for Sophie. And all like Sophie who couldve stayed out of it and comfortably lived their lives, instead they sacrificed their own peace and lives to fight for thr millions of people who did nothing wrong yet were seperated from their families, robbed of their lives, starved, tortured, murdered, and had no voice. She was one of many who fought for us. I will never lose hope in humans knowing there are always Sophies around.  
This is one of the core reasons why freedom of speech is so important and must be protected 
Because they know it's thenlast thing they'll ever say. She probably sat in her cell or wherever thinking of what she herself would want to hear. She probably shed her tears and let the fear overtake her for a short time, then shoved it away to make an example of herself.  She knew what was at stake, and she gave it her all.
> Someone just warned me against protesting the Nazis if they show up in my town.  And then everyone clapped.
‚ÄûSo ein herrlicher Tag, und ich soll gehen. Aber was liegt an unserem Leben, wenn wir es damit schaffen, Tausende von Menschen aufzur√ºtteln und wachzur√ºtteln.‚Äú  - https://gutezitate.com/autor/sophie-scholl
"Not a doubt in my mind I'll be downvoted for pointing this out, but the thing is...did it matter? Her doing this didn't cause the people to rise up and overthrow Hitler. It's a wonderful expression of defiance, yes, but ultimately an impotent one.  EDIT: I'm getting a lot of replies to this, so before I get any more straw-man comments to the effect of ""you're saying nobody should do the right thing if it won't change the ultimate outcome,"" let me direct you to two replies I made that spell out how I *actually* feel about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/91w483/image_sophie_scholls_last_words/e31ktfh/ https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/91w483/image_sophie_scholls_last_words/e31kw2i/ Please give those comments a read before you try to tell me what I think and why I'm wrong for thinking it, when I don't actually think that. The least you can do is give me the courtesy of listening to my actual stance before you argue with it. There is a big difference between ""it didn't matter"" (what I'm saying) and ""it shouldn't have been done"" (what I'm very much NOT saying but a lot of people seem to think I am)."
AND freedom of assembly......very important also.
"Did it matter? Certainly she felt it did. [Henning von Tresckow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_von_Tresckow), who was the principal leader of resistance against Hitler in the German armed forces, said something similar about *needing* to resist regardless of ultimate success:  ""The assassination must be attempted at all costs. Even if it should not succeed, an attempt to seize power in Berlin must be made. What matters now is no longer the practical purpose of the coup, but to prove to the world and for the records of history that the men of the resistance dared to take the decisive step. Compared to this objective, nothing else is of consequence. It is almost certain that we will fail. But how will future history judge the German people if not even a handful of men had the courage to put an end to that criminal?""  I think that just considering people 70 years later can look to her as an inspiration showed that her actions did matter"
Even if she didn't have an impact then, her words mean something to us now.
You are missing the whole point. It does not matter if her defiance aroused either awareness or defiance in others; she had no control over that. She did what was right. All she could do was hope. What is more noble? Sacrificing your life knowing it will stir positive change or not knowing? *crying* Not knowing‚Äîby God‚Äîis the bravest state under which anyone could take action.
That quote is extraordinary. Von Tresckow persisted in the face of almost certain failure and death, personally accepting the burden of representing the good in Germans, and in humanity, to all future generations.  I'd like to think that I could do the right thing in a similar situation. But reading about von Tresckow's life story and his resistance against Hitler has convinced me that I very likely would or could not. The actions of heroes like him are so incredibly far removed from all the challenges I've faced in my life.  Whenever I read about the noble sacrifices of people like von Tresckow, I appreciate even more that there's very little chance that I could ever convince myself to make that kind of sacrifice, let alone even find myself in a position where I have to choose. The best I can do is respect and remember the sacrifices of others, and to feel fortunate and a bit guilty for being randomly assigned an easier life than most.
Don‚Äôt worry mate, come the moment, come the man or woman. Just practice everyday like your character and civility is the last defense against the barbarians at the gate and then if the moment comes... act.   It doesn‚Äôt always come down to life or death, if we‚Äôre lucky it never does, you can still fight the good fight everyday in everything you do

Stop giving away gold god dammit.  For $3.99, you can buy yourself 0.002175 ounces of real gold instead of giving internet strangers pixels.

You seem to be good with spelling. That might do it.
That's not even enough. I know a ton of musicians who are downright the best, but you have to have the look, style, team, marketing, friends and THEN get lucky somehow. 
They‚Äôre trying to make up for the fact they gave Macklemore best rap album over Kendrick a few years back lol

Wrong one 
"When I was a kid, I wanted to play in a band and, of course, the dream was to become famous.   I told my mom, and she said that for every one of my favorite musicians that are rich and famous, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of others that are equally or vastly more talented that never make it anywhere.  So I dropped it, and as I kid my thought process was mom said it was pointless, I trust mom. Never tried anything more than singing to myself.  About a year ago, I showed her some of my personal recording stuff, since she does sing in some local choir groups and similar, and testing out the recording for her I sang something and she just had this flabbergasted look on her face as she never heard me sing before. ""You're incredibly talented,"" she said, ""Why the hell aren't you doing anything with it?""  Gee whiz, I wonder why..."
Wow I did it
That would take away half the charm.
I want you to be gilded one day!  Edit: dreams do come true!
And all the gold.   Edited for clarity. 
So whose dick do I have to suck around here to get gold?
Wow I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen gold given to someone with so few upvotes   Edit:why 
I feel like you came up with your username in a similar way to how I did
Unless your insecurity is about your art
tbh this is true. the influencers weren't affecting me in a negative way but it all felt really pointless. like i took nothing away from the time i wasted scrolling through social media. but when i see people creating things, being productive (whatever that means to you), and learning etc, it really motivates me to start doing the same...
Let‚Äôs put together a list of people to follow, shall we?

Came here for this comment, I just feel bad about my own creative endeavors.
"as someone involved in the fitness community (probably where people started calling themselves ""influencers"" although i could be wrong), it depends. Seeing a bunch of fitness models flexing and posing with bible quotes or whatever is inspiring and cool in small doses, but when I see one of my favorite athletes squatting 500 pounds or benching and constantly bettering themselves, it really really helps me. Not to mention just because someone is an ""influencer"" doesn't mean ALL their content is the same. Some people on instagram have some great informative content reagardless of if they look ridiculously good/strong/ripped"
Don't worry if you think you are no good.  Most of my own art is pretty lame.  But nowadays when I make something, I display it on some random part of my property so I can see it when I walk around my place.    Because I stopped trying to do art for others, and instead just do it for me.  If someone visits me and  genuinely likes something, I give it to them if they want it.  That way even though I am not talented or creative enough to make a living at art, at least the people who like it get to see it, and I get to know it's being appreciated.
This is actually hilarious
The real r/getmotivated is in the comments.
And that's far from all existing NSFW subs on this site. So much more to discover.
Right on man. I was in special ed for 9 years and in high school my special ed teacher told me I was gonna work the line building Cars so don't take college prep. I'm now a graduate 2 times over from college, had a gap of 3.53 when I graduated with my IT security degree. I do IT now for a University. Never stop working hard even when someone says you're not good enough. 
The reverse - where Mensa-talented students who graduate with 4.0 and 5.0s end up doing nothing with their lives - also happens frequently. Just goes to show that people should shut up and get on board with the supporting.
Nice. I like it when people show other people they're wrong.
Sometimes disabilities do hold you back. As someone with Parkinson's disease, I can tell you that most people (educators, employers, businesses) can't be bothered to deal with someone with physical limitations. These days people claim to be inclusive and accepting, but most rarely practice what they preach.   EDIT: Thanks for the comments. I used to be more social and clever. I used to play pinball and video games. I used to teach in a classroom. When my body started deteriorating, I tried to shift my life toward activities that were less physical. People don't understand the depression and guilt that comes with that. They see me as another handicapped person who needs the door held open for them. You don't think I'd give anything to overcome that?
Teachers should never say anything to a student wanting to learn or pursue his dream. In high school, my friend told his teacher he wanted to be a rock star, the teacher just said that no one that graduated from this school became famous. So basically he was calling my friend an idiot.
This country has education ass backward.  150 years ago if you weren't good with your hands, you had hope for a good education.    We need more vocation schools, and to stop thinking a trade is a consolation prize.  Congrats to the OP.
I can't agree more. I am diagnosed with tourettes syndrome.  Due to the co-morbid learning disabilities related I was told I would never graduate highschool. I'm now graduating honors in full AP. I am now a published co-author. A green activist, who meets with government officials on a frequent basis. A accomplished athlete. More importantly an example just like this amazing man that just cause somebody says you're not normal does not mean you cant be extraordinary.

Congrats, dude!
As a teacher, it's disgusting that was said to you. Good for fucking you dude. Don't let anybody tell you what you can't do. Keep it going my man.
Man, I had a 3.5 GPA in HS, CP Classes across the board, somewhat impressive SAT... Everyone thought I was going to make millions.  Turns out - I'm lazy AF. I'm hardly getting by. And now, at 35, I'm not even sure how I would go about turning things around. Good for you. I'm envious.
"I think a lot of the time they are making a smart decision. The standard definitions of success and failure aren't going to work for everyone. I'd argue that they don't work for the majority of people. It's incredibly common for people to spend their lives fighting an uphill battle and on reaching the very top to realize that it's never brought them any real happiness.   Not saying it's always the case with the people you're describing. But often times intelligence is being able to look at what other people say is going to be satisfying to you and realizing that it's their dream instead of your own. It's especially true when what's being held out is essentially martyrdom. ""Done nothing with their lives"" is often shorthand for ""Lived life for themselves rather than for me and the rest of society""  One of the harder puzzles in early life is just figuring out what path is going to actually provide a happy and satisfying life. If the smartest person in the room isn't making the same choice as everyone else it probably shouldn't be assumed that they're being dumb about it. Rather, that there's a chance that they're looking at it in a different way than the average person. "
Tis the sweetest revenge
Amen! This needs to be higher. I hate it when people think that disability is just something you're choosing to succumb to because you feel sorry for yourself. Bitch, no. I used to be a competitive pole dancer until my immune system started fucking up my joints to the point I couldn't walk. Some goals are just out of reach full stop, no matter how much I'd like them not to be. Stop telling me I'm not back on the pole because I don't 'want it bad enough' or something. Gah!
"Amen. My disabilities mean there are LITERALLY things I cannot do. Don't tell me not to ""let"" it hold me back-- I have nerve damage in my arms so, no, I LITERALLY CANNOT rock climb or do martials etc etc anymore. It's not a moral failing. It is not a character flaw. It is simply the state of my body. "
"100%, thank you for saying this. As disabled people, we need our limitations acknowledged and accepted, not belittled or disbelieved, even if the intention is good. When someone tells me not to let my ""disability"" (or as I like to call it, my disability) hold me back, they're saying it like I have a choice in the matter, implicitly blaming me for my own condition. That kind of attitude spills over into people not making accommodation for me (because if I just tried harder I could overcome it). Sometimes there are things that I am simply not able to do.  Motivation and positive thinking won't make my muscles and nerves start magically working again (though you do find the occasional person who genuinely believes that they will), so this kind of motivational post, while well-intentioned, can imply some really shitty things about those disabled people who *can't* achieve everything they wanted or hoped."
Well... don't keep us waiting, who is your famous friend?
Pretty much the case in Switzerland. Only 10% graduate from college, the rest only goes to school for 9 years. Afterwards they start an apprenticeship and go to professional school twice a week and work three times a week. You can become a nurse or banker doing an apprenticeship.
Because I'm a girl they told me that I was never going to be good at math. I'm doing a double degree in pure math and computer science now with a GPA of 17/20. 
"We are on the same boat. I graduated high school with a 2.3. Business Admin teacher told me ""You won't last a semester in college if you do end up going"" She gave me a 60.4(barely passing me) in the class from having a 46 after I went to the principal because I didnt turn in assignments on time, because I was helping kids that couldn't speak English finish their assignments. After she asked me to help them.  Well I did go to college, and lasted more than one semester.   I graduated with a computer engineering degree. It sucked, but it was so worth it. Trust God and work hard. "
My teacher used to say my handwriting looked like a spider crapping ink all over the pages  Jokes on him!  It still does
Some people shouldn't be teachers, but it seems they care more about the paycheck than the impact they have on their students' futures.
humble brag, I was elite student at my country, then I found out I had never done anything but studying, which led to depression.
I think there's also a problem with kids who knew they were the smartest or one of the smartest in high school going on to prestigious colleges and realizing they aren't shit. Going from constant praise and recognition for your intelligence to being average doesn't do a lot for your motivation to become something. 
Yeah my parents are so getting burnt once they realize I'm actually a pathetic loser and not the amazing child they thought I was. Gonna feel so good.
He's the fry cook at the local McDonald's.
Woh they said that because you were a girl? Where're you from? (Or when did you do schooling)
2.4 GPA when I graduated highschool. Not a soul ever talked to me about college.   Didn't even really know what it was when I finished HS. Didn't start college until I was 23.  I'm a dentist.   
If they care about the paycheck why are they teachers? I don't know about private schools but aren't most public teachers pay pretty bad in comparison to most jobs? 
Happened to a friend of mine too. Worked his fucking ass off throughout high school and college to get a computer science degree, realized once he got into the field that he hated what he did and hated that he spent so much time and effort he could have put into other things, quit and now works at Domino's  He's actually happier making near minimum wage and chilling out than making a shitload doing computer shit.
This was me. Was one of the smarter kids from a statistically shit high school, spent a year at UCLA and dropped out over the summer because I was completely lost and thought I was headed for a worthless degree. Now I'm working an ok retail job and I'm still pretty lost. I've been told all my life that I can do great things, but I still have no clue what those things are.

"Skyrim was a fine RPG, but man did they water down the skill system.  I played Daggerfall when Bethesda released that for free on their website a few years back and was surprised to see climbing skills, language skills, streetsmarts, tons of stuff.  The first Elder Scrolls game I played was Morrowind, which I feel was a pretty good balance. There were a lot of interesting spells and skill (spears, throwing stars, levitation, unlock and teleportation spells, waterwalking, burden and feather) without getting crazy granular like Daggerfall did, although I think climbing and medical would have been nice to leave in.  Oblivion just trashed the entire weapon system with blade and blunt, then Skyrim even removed that distinction. ""Why yes, I hold this mace in one hand, just like a dagger, that's totally the same skill set!""  Also, even though there's a literal college of mages, nobody remembers how to craft spells? "

Diagnosed with ADHD while in elementary school, Ronnie Sidney II, spent seven years in special education in the Essex County Public School system in Tappahannock, Virginia. Sidney hated the stigmatization of special education and began to lose interest in school all together.  Nevertheless, he graduated from Essex High School in 2001, but with a 1.8 GPA. With limited options regarding four-year colleges, he enrolled in J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College in Richmond, Virginia, where he did so well that he was able to transfer to a four-year university the following year. Sidney received a bachelor‚Äôs degree in human services in 2006. He went on earn his Master of Social Work at Virginia Commonwealth University.  He  authored the series *Nelson Beats The Odds* to share his experience and inspire others in similar situations.
As a teacher, I can‚Äôt imagine telling any child they‚Äôre not going to college. Congratulations!! Don‚Äôt let the negativity of some people hold you back.
I thought that said 'NELSON BEATS THE DOGS' at first. I hate my eyesight.
Things are getting fucking real with Rest In Peace RaShawn, jesus.
">Never let a ""disability"" hold you back  wow thanks i'm cured  loving the quotation marks around the word disability btw"
Go Rams!
This is a much better and in-depth story than a tweet could ever summarize. Focus shouldn't be on the teacher's negativity, it should be on his amazing transformation at a point where others would have given up. 
ADHD was the disability?  Wtf?  Doesn‚Äôt like a ridiculous % of kids get diagnosed with that? That‚Äôs super common, and tons of people do fine with it using adderal or Ritalin.   In other words, the odds are pretty good already, w today‚Äôs medicine. Beats the odds‚Äù is a bit misleading... I for some reason expected something a lot more severe   EDIT: wow this got way more comments than I expected. To be clear, not knocking ADHD, or the guy. Purely talking about the numbers of it 
My 7th grade study hall teacher told a kid that he was destined to end up in jail.  Because he was drawing instead of doing homework. We're not even in a bad neighborhood. 
On the other hand, it‚Äôs nice to see an author putting death as a concept into a format that kids will be able to understand and their parents will feel comfortable with using as a teaching tool. Better than pretending it doesn‚Äôt happen and leaving kids in the dark about how to cope healthily
He's probably just trying to raise awareness about how learning disabilities aren't often handled well by our school system and also encourage kids who are struggling in a similar situation and remind them that it's possible to be successful despite the circumstances.
Sometimes kids with ADHD are tagged as 504 and some are tagged to special ed. The reason they're tagged special ed is because they've gotten so far behind that the only way we're going to be able to catch them up is to put them in special ed. They're tagged OHI, which is Other Health Impaired. Sometimes we have kids who are ADHD and they're not on medication and they get so far behind that sitting in a regular classroom with Section 504 accommodations is not going to help. We do the best we can and let me tell you-- we special ed teachers can work miracles :) I got a second grader with learning disabilities 3 years ago who couldn't even spell his own name and by fourth grade he scored higher than his general education peers on the state READING test. 
One of my friends is one of the most well informed people I know when it comes to things he‚Äôs passionate about - comics, art, music (drumming and guitar) etc. it goes being just knowing the medium, he understands the theory behind it, the psychology behind how we see art and identify non-real characters as real. Just a crazy amount of depth with it, but he was in special education too.   I think you are right about our school systems - if you‚Äôre not naturally good at math or science you get put into a class where you‚Äôre made to feel stupid, when i reality you just don‚Äôt care about math and science. 
you always overestimate what you can achieve in 1 year, but underestimate what you can do in 5

As a manager, I try to instill this into every employee that works for me. It‚Äôs better to admit that you don‚Äôt know something upfront, rather than trying to fix a major error later down the road because you told someone you knew what you were doing.   I‚Äôd rather take the time to do something right instead of struggling to fix something over the course of months!
"One of the most respectable things you can say about something is ""I don't know enough to have an opinion on that."" "
This is one of the things my college courses in education taught me. Admit when you don‚Äôt know something and then model the correct researching to find the answer. Now that I‚Äôm a teacher, when my kids ask me something I don‚Äôt know I get excited to learn something new myself.   We use the smart board, so that kids can see how to select information, discriminate between valid and invalid sources, and talk about the process of research. It always opens up a great conversation and even though it screws up my lesson plans (I don‚Äôt get to what I had planned sometimes) it‚Äôs worth it because properly researching something you don‚Äôt understand is probably the most valuable skill you can have as an adult, IMO, and should be given more credit in the classroom. 
"Exactly. I tell my staff the same and I tell customers ""I don't know."" On a daily basis.   Don't ever try to wing it. The results can be disastrous.   Edit: I can't stress this enough for my peeps that work in customer service. Even if you're 99% sure of your answer, take the time to get 100. Your customers will appreciate that. "
I would agree with your comment, but I don't know enough to have an opinion on that.
"Your confident answer is ""I don't know, but I will find an answer for you soon.""  If someone doesn't respect that response then slap 'em with a trout, I say"

Ah, a reminder of how much I hate myself. Thanks! 
I decided to drop out of grad school in 2014 because I decided I would be miserable working for 50 years in that field. I had to take a $10/hour part time job for a while. In summer 2015 I got into a big company, but in an area I didn't like. I applied for over a dozen positions within the company's department I wanted, but couldn't even get an interview. Stuck with it. In early 2018, someone offered to take a chance e on me. I'm working as a manager and doing really well. It's not the Olympics, but I was ready to give up on my goal many times. Glad I didn't.
I actually use an email service that can sent back what I wrote about myself after a period of time.    So 6 years ago, I wrote myself about what my career will be, my dream and the relationship I will have. After 6 years, I received it and it not even close to any of it! If anything, my life is regressing.   I envy this person, she got everything before 22 yo. I wish I was her :)  Edit - I used [FutureMe](http://futureme.org/) for the curious
Fuck yeah.  That made this 10x better.

The best time to plant a tree was ten years ago. The second best time is now. 
‚ÄúWhat is a legacy? It‚Äôs planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.‚Äù
What does that mean about our society that is destroying the world for short term profits. 
Despite what the name may suggest,¬†New College¬†is one of Oxford‚Äôs oldest. Founded in 1379, at its heart lies a dining hall that features expansive oak beams across its ceiling. About a century ago, an entomologist discovered that the beams were infested with beetles and would need replacing. The College agonized over where they might find oaks of sufficient size and quality to make new beams. Then, as Stewart Brand recounts,  One of the Junior Fellows stuck his neck out and suggested that there might be some worthy oaks on the College lands. These colleges are endowed with pieces of land scattered across the country which are run by a college Forester. They called in the College Forester, who of course had not been near the college itself for some years, and asked him if there were any oaks for possible use.  He pulled his forelock and said, ‚ÄúWell sirs, we was wonderin‚Äô when you‚Äôd be askin‚Äô.‚Äù  Upon further inquiry it was discovered that when the College was founded, a grove of oaks had been planted to replace the beams in the dining hall when they became beetly, because oak beams always become beetly in the end. This plan had been passed down from one Forester to the next for over five hundred years saying ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt cut them oaks. Them‚Äôs for the College Hall.‚Äù  
Man that guy had has son in his 60s, good on him he still got it
I planted around 10-15 trees in an orchard with my Grandpa about 15 years ago. At the time, I remember my parents having to convince me to do it, reminding me that he wouldn‚Äôt be around forever and that I should savour those moments while I could. He died 7 years ago and of course I very fondly look back on that memory now and every time I visit the orchard - once a year probably. The trees have grown from tiny shrubs to quite substantial things in the intervening period. When I‚Äôm there, I sit under a tree at the top of the orchard and think about my Grandpa; he was quite the character - an eccentric man, a surgeon and also a Captain in the Royal Artillery, who fought right though the War on various fronts, including being present at the evacuation of Dunkirk. A great man and a great memory!
The little girl is about to face plant that tree
Don‚Äôt procrastinate the tree planting. I‚Äôm looking at you, me
r/expectedhamilton  EDIT: Didn't realize that's a real sub lol
It reminds me of the boomer generations. Reaping the benefits of a post war society with trees in abundance, failing to plant more in a vain attempt at replacing trees with branded pay-to-use umbrellas.

This isn‚Äôt even his final form 
No matter how brave that is, no opponent will ever be comfortable enough to hit hard. 
Everyone's talking about this like a sparring match is about to start, completely ignoring the fact that breaking and forms competitions exist.  EDIT: Not that that detracts from the /r/GetMotivated element, just sick of reading everyone's comments on how the person fighting this kid feels.
Sweep the oxygen machine!
The look in this kids eyes. I'm not giving up
Local boy literally too angry to die
Would turning the oxygen off count as a choke hold?      Edit: My first gold?! I was expecting to be down voted into oblivion, thank you stranger!
Any kid who doesn‚Äôt let this kid win is just going to be seen as a dick
This kid could be 21 or 10 now not sure how old the image is. All I know is I got mad respect for him based on this one picture. 
This looks like beginning of a super villain. 
Turns out he has one of the sports obsessed parents and they still force him to go to the tournament
Ooo im sorry little johnny but this is your final form
Most likely he has no opponent and is going to perform a kata, a series of choreographed movements to be done by an individual
I would. You underestimate me.
Just pinch the tubes off.
This is 100% Kata but really incredible none the less. 
Sweep the tank!
The look in this kids eyes. He is about to fuck some shit up.
I don't think he's going to fight anyone, he's probably going to perform a kata, a set of choreographed movements to be done by an individual
>This kid could be 21 or 10 now  Or, you know.... There's also a third possibility.
r/jesuschristreddit
...To sign then we can discharge you? Right doc?
I do hope so even though he has a red belt so... I'm not sure
And I would recommend you not to. because if you win, you will be hated for beating a sick kid. There's no win in this fight for you. 
"I'm not trying to be ""that guy"" but it looks like Tae Kwon Do in which case it is forms or poomse. "
r/imgoingtohellforthis
Cause he might...not be around much longer? Idk man im not used to using dark humor i guess
That's probably just his level 
Hated, but karate tournament champion. Easy decision.
Dunno what I expected tbh, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt that
Can you please convert that level into numbers please Im colourblind
It used to be dark jokes. Now it's just political shite
There's no real standard. Sometimes it's the first coloured belt you get (above white), and sometimes it's pretty close to black. It varies with form and club. 
Even more reason for it to not be BJJ. It looks just like karate. But red/blue can be assigned even when you're not sparring. I'd go with the latter since his belt isn't worn in or an appropriate size, meaning he was probably given it for this event, and it isn't the one he trains in. Otherwise it'd be well-worn where the knot is tied. Belts only sit like his when they're new. 
This is honestly so helpful to me that I could cry right now.
"Great advice. I haven't had a day off since July, so every morning when I wake up, my first thought is ""FUUUUCK I WANT TO QUIT""  Then I catch that shit and tell myself ""it'll be alright, the new job is great, the paycheck will be phat, the cute waitress might work tonight, might trade some cool tips with the other chef, hang in there"""
"""What if everything works out!""  ""It won't""  ""What if your hard work pays off!?""  ""You should have worked harder""   That's usually how the thought process goes."
What if fear of success is the problem?
Good!! I read this and stopped cold. I rarely realize how anxious I actually am and just joke about being a sassy pessimist.   This really resonated as something I could genuinely do, and that‚Äôs an awesome feeling.   Of course, I had to share. 
No waitress is cute enough to work every day for months on end.
"Same!   ""Im going to study and be prepared"" ""Why you bomb evey test""  ""It will work out this time!"" ""You said that the last 6 times""  Then you realise you are just fighting yourself and you think... should probably call a professional... nah I'm good."
There is another tip:  Ideally you don't replace on thought with another, they are all nonsense.    Instead, focus on the present.  Get out of your head and do what's in front of you.
My problem is that I tend to think more about negative outcomes, in an effort to prevent a letdown if such an outcome occurs.   I always expect the worst to happen, so that I'm pleasantly surprised when things go fine.  Although, because of the anxiety, I do spend way too much time dwelling on the ways various things could go wrong in my life.
My daughter is though :]  If I don't work 70 hours a week, my income would be below median wages, and we could be homeless if I broke my arm and couldn't work for two months. 
Brene brown has covered some interesting research on this. It has a name, but I forget. Basically, it‚Äôs a common coping strategy but people who have actually had the worst happen say it did not prepare them at all. It only stopped them from enjoying the good things they did have, while they had them.  She suggests a better strategy is to acknowledge what you‚Äôre fearful of, recognize that this is scary because you care about it and try to also appreciate the thing you care about instead of focusing on fear of the loss.
One of the reasons I'm hesitant about parenthood. I'm not ready to handle that level of work and responsibility. I have so much respect for you.
Parenthood is hard in this economy unless your daddy gives you a small loan of 1 million dollars.   Wait until you have a full career, and already have a mortgage for owning a 3 bedroom house.  Get the full effect of the fun you can have while you're single in your 20's. I'm already partied out, so that lifestyle is no longer appealing to me.  Honestly I'm still not ready for this level of responsibility lol.   Much love fam.
As a 35 year old, this starting to feel like my career choice.
You're right sign! I'm going to abandon my husband and daughter immediately.

"My motto this year was: ""put the extra quarter in."" I realized that my brain was tricking me to take the risk of spending only one quarter on a parking meter rather than two and rush to complete whatever errand it was in the 8 or 10 minutes I had, risking a $75 parking ticket rather than spend another 25 cents. Predictably this behavior eventually resulted in said pricey parking ticket. At that point I decided to examine where else in my life I should put the extra quarter in rather than try to avoid a minor discomfort at a hefty price."
What did you use to do and what do you do now? I like to hear those stories.
"My stepdad was a shitstain who's ""career"" was early 2000s version of herbalife. He dragged my mom through bankruptcy and by the time they finally divorced my mom's sole income was a $13/hr job in a warehouse office with no real education to back her up.  At 55 she decided ""actually, fuck this"" and went to a community college for a few years, and is now making $33/hr doing vascular ultrasounds for a hospital.  So with anectodal experience I can confirm it's never too late at least up to 55"
Crap. I'm 55 (true story) and I'm in the middle of a career shift. I know where I'm coming from. I don't know yet where I'm going.
"""If the path ahead of you is clear, you are probably on someone else's""  As such, congratulations! "
I think this is a great sentiment because it would, in practice, break cycles of abuse and neglect.
"Even better than ""Be the person your dog thinks you are."""
This is really making me think about what I would have needed when I was younger. I needed something, that's for sure, but I don't think I would have listened anyway.
My new goal.  I can't upvote this enough!
I am not gonna grow a vagina.
I think about this all the time when I'm with my kids. I'm the father my dad never was. 
This was exactly what motivated a friend of mine and me to launch a game development summer camp for kids in our area. We grew up knowing we wanted to be in the industry, but didn't have the tools, knowledge, or guidance to make it happen until after college. We have given a few hundred kids futures in the games industry after we launched in 2013. Proud of what we have done!

Good to see Drake is going for a more upbeat album title this time around
"This is basically what happened with my mom. She was abused as a kid and never really had a safe home or felt loved by her parents. And while that abuse caused her a lot of issues down the line as an adult, one good thing that did come out of it was she knew exactly what she didn't get as a child, and worked extra hard to provide that for me.  She was an awesome parent (both my parents were) and I'm forever grateful to her for that.   However, it doesn't always work out quite that well. Her siblings, who were subject to the same abuse, did not both turn out the same way. Her brother did, and is a fantastic father to his two kids, but her sister fell back into the exact same patterns of abuse with her own daughters that she experienced as an adult.   It's very easy, I think, for me as a kid who had a very normal childhood to look at this quote and be like, ""Yeah! Why doesn't everyone do this!"", but it's hard in practice when you're an actual victim of abuse to remove yourself far enough from your experiences and consider how you can grow from it and improve on your parents' model when you raise your own kids.  Many people fall into the trap of just emulating their parents, which is great for people who had great parents (I know I will be attempting to emulate my parents in many respects when I have kids), but for people who were victims of abuse, it just perpetuates the cycle.  "
Yea I had a pretty easy childhood. When I was a kid I would've wanted was a dumbass to play video games with. I can crush it in that role as is.
Drugs
Not with that attitude.
40s me: we need more money.
I do the same thing as your mom, I'm glad she turned out well :)  My sister is just kinda crazy and helluva shit parent. I do hope my sister gets better.
Hey if that's what you needed, that's what you needed. Nothing wrong with wanting a friend. Now you can be that friend for somebody!
A simple compliment from you might be the highlight of somebody's week.  It may save them.  And it's just a few words from you.  It's so easy to make other people happier.
"Remove the word""ugly"" and read it again.    Much more wholesome"
This kind of shit is why I have trust issues lol
I like that he lied. I know that's  not popular,  but I like that he recognizes that his opinion is subjective and unimportant. It doesn't matter that he disagrees with the statement he made, what's important is that it had the power to help someone.. so he sets aside his ego.. and his need to be correct, or have his opinion validated.. and just says what needed to be said.
If someone randomly tells me my hat is nice I'm taking that shit as an insult. 
Yeah not sure what is up with people sitting on this.  Who cares what the guy actually thinks about the hat. His actual opinion doesn't matter.  Most people have so few positive things said about them that anything, especially things they've made a conscious choice about such as their fashion or an attempt to improve such as going to the gym or watching their diet, are great sources of happiness if you comment positively about them.  So giving them a compliment isn't about you or your opinion, it's about putting aside your ego to make someone else feel good. That's the super power.   Shoot for the moon golden Lincoln man! 
"True story.  I was facing homelessness at 18. Back injury from a hit and run on my now worthless bike. Couldn't keep my job because of received threats from my abuser. No car. No phone. No computer. I had a selfish boyfriend that is completely the wrong person for me but all I had for a support system. All I wanted to do was finish the school semester at community college and it seemed like even that was now impossible. I was about to lose the room I was renting because I ran out of my savings and felt like all the hopes and dreams I was holding onto were no longer mine to own.  I sat alone in front of a municipal lake, wondering what the fuck I got myself into. How could I allow my blind optimism to believe that starting a new life for myself would turn out okay? It's not okay. It won't be okay. It may never again be okay.  A man within a few years of my age has a huge but shy smile on him some distance from me. I watched him for an hour or so meander closer towards me, then further away, then a little closer, then back, and so on. There were times where he would stare at the wading ducks in the water like they were the most interesting thing in the world, holding his hand up to his mouth to cover a smile. It was the middle of the afternoon and tons of people were around so I didn't feel threatened.  He's now 15 feet away. I get up and start to leave and he's like ""Wait miss, please! I'm a chicken shit.""  ""You're a what?""  ""I'm a chicken shit. I'm sorry. I wanted to come up sooner but I didn't want you to think I was trouble. I have to say something.""  Who the fuck is this guy. ""Ok?""  ""You seemed really sad, and I don't know what's going on in your life but I promise things will get better. I'm Ariel.""  Ariel appears next to a body of water to tell me this world that I don't understand how to navigate and may be just as fucked as the last one I was in... Would be okay.   We talk for awhile. I share my fears. I cry. He chokes up but does not cry. We talk for another hour or so. He is embarrassed by his ""Disney girl name"" and I'm like ""no dude, that's Shakespeare!"" He smiles again and holds eye contact and we talk some more. I tell him about The Tempest. He tells me that I'm beautiful, smart, courageous, but never inches close for physical connection. Never asks for my number. Eventually we get up, say goodbyes and I offer to hug him. We walk separate ways.   Ariel saved me from giving up on myself when all I could see was darkness. I didn't scream or shut down some dude trying to muster the courage to talk to a pretty girl. A brief exchange between two young people had what I want to believe was significant positive impact on one another.   Legitimately, he saved my life."
"I actually added in about 4 more ""ugly's"" and 1 ""little bitch""..."
Yeah, it ruins it that he says ugly hat. The moral of the story is that being fake and dishonest with people is a good thing because it misleads then into feeling good??
I get the message and I really love it, but this reminded me of that episode from The Simpson‚Äôs when homer was in High School and at the drinking fountain, and two girls walk up to him and tell him ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre coooool Homer Simpson‚Äù and as they walk away, homer stands there feeling all good when you can hear one of the other girls say ‚Äúoh Sarah, that was so mean‚Äù lol 
"It made me imagine a woman giving a ""compliment"" if you know what I mean. "
Yup. People need to be complimented. Especially guys tend to get very few compliments and it can hurt so much. I'm 20 and I don't remember the last time I recieved a compliment face to face. Don't know if I've ever got one. Just a stranger smiling at me makes me happy because they're happy and for whatever reason they choose to show me that happiness. It's the only compliment I've ever recieved by a stranger.  Edit: I've been gilded!? Wow, my first one. Thank you stranger!
‚ÄúAwww biiiitch‚Äù -Scary Terry
You know what? I love your way of seeing it. And you‚Äôre a sweet person for being happy about someone else being happy.  I‚Äôm a smiley person in general, which was weird where I grew up and fits in more where I live now. But since I grew up where people tended to be a little more reserved and suspicious, I always feel a bit ‚Äúguilty‚Äù for randomly smiling at strangers and worry they might call me out on it (I know, I‚Äôm weird. lol)  But you saying a stranger‚Äôs happiness makes you happy, too, is kind and selfless and exactly what I think, too, when I see someone smile at me.  Have an Internet smile from me! :)  (This probably doesn‚Äôt make sense. Not very good at explaining myself today. lol)
Awww!  The reaction of the two guys is so pure.  This is great.
Wish I could find a good cheap gym with people that are actually friendly and help out. My current gym is just a bunch of gangster wannabes that just stand around, give dirty looks all the time, and can't put their shit back when they are done with it.

Can you imagine if you were at a 24 hour fitness, hit your PR, and complete strangers started screaming/cheering? I‚Äôd be at the gym every day.

That's because its legitimately a very impressive feat of strength that most men who lift regularly can't do.
If everyone is so surprised she succeeded, why wasn‚Äôt anyone spotting her? Honest question, I know nothing 
Mine was mostly trophy wives. As a female, not really that fun for me, but...   I‚Äôd have allergic reactions to their perfume mid-run when they hit the ellipticals behind me in full hair and makeup.
It‚Äôs such a cliche to say this because it‚Äôs their slogan, but Planet Fitness. It‚Äôs cheap and the staff is super friendly. I‚Äôm not an avid lifter and am only doing it to get in shape, and it‚Äôs seriously the best place. There are old ladies there lifting next to the big ass muscle men, and I look at them both and think, ‚ÄúIf the little old lady can do it, so can I and maybe I‚Äôll look like that dude some day.‚Äù Also when I first joined I worked crazy hours and the only time I could go was like 11:30 at night, so the 24 hours thing was nice. 
Thank you, was looking for this.
As a fellow sufferer of depression, I HAD to post it. Hang in there, we'll get through this together.
It's much easier to lift when there's no weights at the ends of the weight stick.
Or he understands quality bars can be expensive and doesn't want to fuck up the bearings
If you know anything about straps you can clearly see they aren't strapped to the bar.  
If you‚Äôre talking about her dropping the weights after making the lift it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs so heavy that you can‚Äôt just set it down normally, and it‚Äôs ok to drop a bar with plates like that because they‚Äôre designed to be dropped from overhead, they‚Äôre called bumper plates. 
Can confirm. Can squat 405 can't even snatch 95 pounds 
This isn't a lift you can spot. The lifter should know how to fail safely if something goes wrong.
there is no spot for the snatch lift. if you can't hit it, dump it. most people will get close to getting it, but dump it in front of them when they know they dont have the lift
Mine is all old people. Its actually a pretty well equipped, serious gym so I'm pretty well placed to use all the uncrowded equipment/weights that Bernard and Enid would break themselves on.  Still being one of the strongest dudes at your gym is pretty hollow when you are the only one not drawing a pension.
Ugh! Those disgusting trophy wife gyms! I mean, there's so many of them though! Which one? Which one is it?
Free pizza and no compound lifts amirite?! 
So THAT'S what coach meant when he wanted to see my snatch 
>weight stick  This guy doesn‚Äôt lift.
With two, count them, two, marshmallows. 
Weight stick....im using that....cant stop laughing
I'm sure you could power snatch it easily. It'd be a legal lift in competition.
If she lifting it safely though?  It appears to me if she was to give up on it while it's over her head, it would come falling down on her back and lower back before she would have a chance to get out of the way.  Or is it just a bad angle shot to where it appears as though she doesn't have her rear out as far as I think while arching her head forward.  edit:  Awesome, ask a question because it looks unsafe and people just pile on downvotes.  Stay classy r/GetMotivated
> if you can't hit it, dump it.  Also important in dating.
Oh but you can. I spotted your mom's snatch last night.   Edit: Huh, never thought my first gold would come from a your mom joke, but thanks stranger. 
Mine is a ton of old people too, but they're fucking jacked. 
They never broke a sweat, that was the trick, would just go ~2mph for an hour and just rarely eat.
What is the correct term for it? Bar?
Yea, not empty. You dont drop an empty bar, because then the thing hitting the ground is the bearings and not the plates, which will damage them.
Maybe. I think it's a range of motions thing more than anything. That movement terrifies me 
If she failed, she'd just jump backwards and drop the bar in front of her
It's a lift you have to practice a lot for form before you can get the weight up. Most people who practice this lift have done it enough times to know when they're going to fail before it get to that dangerous point. Normally just dropping. It in front and letting their arms push it forward a bit as it falls.
And the stock market  And your job  And life in general. 
I need pictures of your jacked old people community because the thought made me laugh. 
Yes.
Pain Pole
This, it's not like when you fail in weight lifting all your muscles just go limp. You can somewhat control that shit
Fuck that... From now on the bar will be refferd to as the weight stick haha
Username checks out
As someone who has had 2 shoulder surgeries I nope the fuck out of snatches.
unless if someone writes your name in the death note
Throw a couple 45s on the end of the weight stick bro
>a couple 45s  Oh, you mean the big disks? Yea, throw some big disks on that weight stick. 
45lb iron donuts you mean?
I'm feeling risky today bruh, throw some of the little heavies on there too.
It‚Äôs starting to sound sexual.
Iron bronuts*

Arny has just never stopped becoming a bigger badass.... cool guy
I love how real this is, because Arnold himself has evolved over the years. Just like all of us, he's done things that he regrets or is even humiliated by, but he seems like he's spent that time contemplating who he wants to be, how he wants to be remembered, and is still working on it.
Read it in Arnold‚Äôs voice it‚Äôs a treat
Got burned so hard he could compete in the special Olympics now
"This would probably influence me a lot if I was this person. Just people around me asking ""Why did you stop sitting in front of the computer all day?"" and me saying ""Arnie told me to.""  Edit: accidental random dot"
"I watched the special olympics World Cup the other day and I remembering looking at my friend and saying, ""I could never do what they're doing."" "
I feel like today's discussions lack these teaching moments. Like when someone disagrees with you, instead of demonizing them outright, try to educate them. They may have been raised in a bubble and moments like these are their only source of fresh air. 
"People will remember that guy.   Someone: ""Remember Kyle from accounting?""  Other guy: ""No""  Someone: ""Yeah you do, he did that thing...""  Other guy: ""Oh yeah, isn't he that the idiot that got roasted by Arnold Schwarzenegger on Facebook?""  Someone: ""Yeah, that guy. He got hit by a bus"""
Arnie's posts are always like  Deep wise deep deep wisdom smart deep wise.... murder. 
Burninator.
It would just remain a worthless puddle. 
/r/TerminatedByWords
An utterly savage destruction of this mans entire world view. Excellent. Murdered by words almost doesn't cover the existential dread you'd hope this cretin feels now. 
His goal in life is to achieve goals.
THIS DUDE HAS BEEN IN THE ZONE FOR OVER FOUR DECADES. FOUR DECADES-- NOTHIN BUT NET
>Just like all of us, he's done things that he regrets or is even humiliated by  Kindergarten Cop wasn't *that* bad.
I love that Arnie isn't just some muscle bound neandarthal who's only claim to fame is his body building. He made that shit into a lifestyle. Discipline became key to becoming who he is.
No thanks, i like to read everything in Gilbert Godfreed's voice.  Edit: spelling
Holy Fuck I Snorted When I was Laughing üòÇ 
Except with no actual cussing, which makes it all the more impactful.

"A friend of mine at navy boot camp never stopped talking about how much he loved his girlfriend. It was almost annoying but he was really earnest and a decent guy.

I work at a gym selling memberships. It's a pretty fun job. A lot of people probably think folks walking around parking lots and soliciting are miserable, but I'd much rather do that than be stuck in an office. Plus, I get to meet amazing people, and I do my best to try to help as many people as I can. I get most of my job is being an annoying shit and pushing memberships, but there's moments than remind me how much I love being alive.  Yesterday, I met a man putting oil in his Honda Civic outside a Walmart. I offered a gym membership, he said it was a bad time, he was going through a rough patch. So I put my sales stuff away, and just told him I'd like to listen.  Turns out he's a homeless ex-marine with a wife and kid. He served two tours in Iraq and fought a lot in Baghdad. He saved up his checks to buy a car, and he and his wife and child lived out of that. He didn't ask for money, or help, or anything. I just lent an ear and listened. We shared stories. I'd gone through some stuff too, abusive parents and whatnot. By the end, we were both hugging it out. I like to think I helped him, but really, he helped me just as much. I don't know where he is now, or what is name is, but I hope he's doing well.  Anyways, the moral is to never stop fighting. Every day above ground is a good one, and every time you can help another human being makes it even better. If anybody needs to talk, please send me a message. I don't care what it's about, I just like to listen. I hope you all have a great rest of the day.

"Been wanting to share this for a very long time. Now, I feel like I can help. Met her when we were eight years old. Always joked about growing up and getting married. I moved away for about ten years then Moved back for my last year of high school and got her pregnant. Worked more than a slave for the next ten years. Had children, a house, two cars and everything I thought anyone could ask for.. Maybe it wasn't the nicest of the nicest material things but it was more than the average household along with unconditional love. All she had to do was be an awesome mother, wife, and a person. But as you probably know, when you think you have life figured out, that's when Life will kindly remind you, ""Fuck you!"" Found her texting an old friend, completely blamed everything on me and forced me into a divorce. That was the 21st day of June exactly 90 days later she made our 8 year old daughter hand me our divorce papers. Because of my ignorance and trusting her to do the right thing, she was able to move nine hours away with my children with her new boyfriend. She was now pregnant. I fell into a three year drugged induce Zombie living Coma. I lost everything I ever built financially, spiritually, and most important I lost my children. I thought I was at the end of the road with only death or prison in my sights. This sub LITERALLY changed my life. Now, these past two years, I've been re-building myself. My children and I have the strongest bond ever, I drive a 2ss convertible, women find me attractive often, and living a Life I thought was over with for sure. I help people in situations like I was in and reach out whenever I can help. Divorce is a horrible experience. I wouldn't wish for my enemies. Everything happens for a reason. Always always always Smile through it all because after all, they can't take away your Smiles. "
Going through a break up right now. It hasn't been 2 months. In the heat of the moment, anything seems possible.  I tell myself what's more important, the girl or every other fucking thing I can do with my whole life. Doesn't make it easier. At least not yet.  It's hard going from having plans with a special person who thinks you're just as special, to just having yourself. And not doing everything we all talked about.  I have 2 side chicks I see regularly, but I still feel numb. Girls just aren't what they used to be. I feel enlightened, like I know how great it can all be. But none of them are her.  Girls just aren't the same
"Breakups can be as bad on some people as going cold turkey when a heavy opioid addict. It's sometimes just as serious for one's physical health.   Kinda insane. That said, it's usually likely when this happens that more is going on mentally. Potential mental illness that hasn't exhibited yet can. Not saying it happened in this case but men can generally exhibit the first major episode of a mental condition from 18-25 and usually during times of extreme stress and emotion.   Okay, I looked at possible citations, they didn't seem appropriate or useful for this context. If disappointed I didn't cite a study on voles you're welcome to find it yourself. This however seemed best.   ""4:36 And then, the very last question ‚Äî I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say, ""Would you die for him or her?"" And, indeed, these people would say ""Yes!"" as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it.  4:58 So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity in a lot of brain regions. In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed, that's exactly what happens.  5:26 I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low. But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive.  5:54 And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, ""No, thank you,"" you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow.""  -Helen Fischer 2006 [TED Talk.

Google works though for more info.    Edit: holy shit this comment blew up. At the time of posting I was sitting on the toilet. I have a tad bit of personal experience with mental health and suicide from many perspectives personally. Later today I'll look into posting some good links on this post and try and respond to everyone.   Just a quick thing to add. If you're in a crisis, call 911 and tell the person that you're suicidal and need help. They will respond accordingly.   "
> with only two people deciding to jump after he interceded  That's a good number he's talked down, but having someone jump has got to be really tough.
The modern media is focused on the wrong sigma of police.  If we could focus on this side, and make these individuals role models we possibily would have less police falling into the dark side sigma.  I think deep down everyone desires to respectable.  Being respectible doesn't mean you have to be manly, and this is the biggest problem testosterone driven police.  Edit:  I know sigma might mean different things.  To clarify I mean it as the extreme standard deviations in the bell curve distribution.

"I think that version makes a for better story of perseverance.   A lot of anti-suicide stuff takes the form: ""he decide not to jump, eventually solved his problems offscreen, and is now happy.  Therefore don't commit suicide.""  I've never been suicidal, but does that shit even work on depressed people?  I feel like they'd recognize that they're getting conned (because they are)."

I've been there man. High school sweetheart broke it off. I had plenty of strange afterwards but nothing was the same. Things just kinda healed over time and got better and better. Now i'm married with a daughter and could never want anything else. Hang in there buddy, tomorrow's a new day.
I know the struggle. It's been four months for me now after being together for 5 years. I was getting ready to buy an engagement ring.   It sucks. It really does and it's going to suck for a while. I've hooked up with another girl but I can't get that connection anymore. It's not the same and it's not who I wanted it with. This girl wasn't great to me but we had a connection like no other. And it's awful going from someone being around all the time to just yourself.   All I can say is, let yourself be upset. No matter how good of a day you have, don't be afraid to be sad at the end. I have it constantly. I go out with new friends and have the time of my life, but at the end of the night, I sit in my car screaming at the top of my lungs just asking why I'm not good enough. I scream and cry and grab the steering wheel and shake the whole car. I do it until I can't anymore. But then something happens. I feel great afterwards. I start to smile and wipe away the tears because I know no matter what, I'm strong enough to get through it and know that one day someone will come into my life and knock me off my feet.   You can get through this! I believe in you and if you ever need to talk, PM me. I'm here for you. You're important. Don't ever forget that. 
Yeah I broke up with a girl at 19 years of age. Happened at 10am that morning.   2pm that afternoon after knowing my mind was being very, very strange and having had gone to the doctors and hospital and been turned away, I took over 100 pills and passed out.  The police kicked in my door, gave me CPR, hospital filled me with charcoal and I woke up 1pm the next day.   Break ups can fuck up a young delicate mind.  Edit: Delicate not dedicate 
That's a fantastic strike rate. I have managed to talk 8 down, pulled 6 from the water and lost one.   They say you always remember the ones you lose. It is true.
You guys need to watch the movie The Bridge.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwl-Pa_QT0M  Living in SF and having walked over that bridge a ton, it's a pretty weird experience.   Between 1937 and 2012, an estimated 1,600 bodies were recovered of people who had jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, located in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States. The impact from the fall kills 98 percent of people who jump or fall from the bridge, as they enter the water. (Wikipedia)  People come from all over the world to jump off that bridge. 
We need to see the police force as inherently human. Some are great and want to help, some are there for a check, and some are scum. Just like the rest of humanity. Cop in the OP is overall a great human being.

When my dad's mom was dying, confined to the bed, he and his brother were attending to her beside. She suddenly mentioned that there was a leak in her bathroom and could they take a look at it. So, my dad and uncle searched out the leak and discovered it was a pipe behind the wall. They told my grandma and she asked them to fix it, so they got their tools and opened up the wall. Then they realized they needed to move the toilet, so they disconnected the bowl and started breaking into the wall behind the toilet. It was about four hours into their endeavor when they realized they were fixing a bathroom she'd never use again. For no reason. They went back into the bedroom and she was laying there just smiling at them.   It felt wrong for her boys to be in the house and not doing something for her, so she'd given them something to do. As she'd gotten weaker, they'd become more parental towards her - as we do with aging parents. But, that role reversal never sits well and so she'd needed to make the point that she was their mom up until the end. It worked.

"I'm high school I was bullied mercilessly and always worried about what people were thinking of me. When I got to college, I had an epiphany. Two girls approached my friend and I and said they were pledging a sorority and had to serenade us. My friend was embarrassed, but I realized that I'd likely never again have two beautiful ladies singing to me like that. I decided that I didn't care of the sorority girls were told ""sing to those two losers."" I was just going to enjoy it.  I've lived my life like that ever since. There is a small group of people whose‚Äã opinion I care about. For everyone else, I'll take their praise, but I won't take their criticisms to heart."
They really are. The last real time I got to talk to my mom, she wouldn't stop worrying about whether or not I would be okay. She was literally days from death and still wouldn't stop making sure her kids were taken care of. Moms are amazing like that. 
When my mom was in the hospital, dying of lung cancer, brain cancer, and pneumonia, she somehow found out that I had a cold. She called me and told me there was a bottle of DayQuil in the cabinet, drink lots of fluids, and to make sure I'm dressing in layers. I started crying after the call. 
Two months before my Mom died, she was busy rewriting the phonebook in a neater handwriting so that we won't have trouble accessing the necessary numbers after her death. At that time I didn't know her death was inevitable and I'll never forget how much that act broke my heart.

"I think it is important to recognize cultures have different values. In college I was told to separate the notion of race and culture. It is much easier to study groups of people by the choices they make rather than arbitrary genetic variations.  Edit-in-response-to-edit: If it is not intentional it is not racism. When we were toddlers my grandfather, god rest his soul, used to chase us around his house saying ""Come here you cotton picker!"". He would also use cotton-picking in a derogatory fashion rather than cursing. It was a lot of fun at the time (90's) but at one point my brother made the connection and asked my grandfather: ""Who picks cotton?"". His eyes went wide and to my knowledge he never uttered the phrase again. He passed back in January in his sleep in his mid 80's. He was pretty cool. He was the one who introduced me to Google back when it first came out. Miss you Grandpa!"
You know who else said that? OP's mom!
Ehh. Cursive fucking always english with me aswell.
For everything else, there's Mastercard.
This makes me cry :(.
I'm pretty sure I started crying after that comment
SERIOUSLY.. I don't want to think about my mom being gone one day üòü
Y'all fuckers need to work on your cursive. 
It's still pretty recent and makes me tear up sometimes too. She wasn't very lucid by that point. But you could tell she knew I was going to be on my own soon.        If it makes you feel better, she was a fucking amazing mother. I'm lucky to have had the time with her that I did. 
Yeah no...they shpuld learn binary for when the machines take over
"Just wanted to say that you have my sincerest, sincerest condolences.  I am terrified of the day I have to wake up to the knowledge of never seeing my mom again. After all, she's all I have left.  I once read something along the lines of ""the death of a mother is the first one you'll have to push through without her by your side"". It wasn't in english, so please excuse the rocky translation. I hope you find comfort in the time you had with your mom up until now, and the values she instilled into you. And how she shaped who you turned out to be. "
Binary fucks with me, I only read hexadecimal. 
I would like also to point out that there is spelling error in the last word in 15th line before last line . It should be spelled 10010101   
Thanks man, I'm not a native speaker and binary English just fucks with me.

"""It's not about the money, it's about sending a message..."""
Do I have to spend all of it to get revenge?  Because I can spend about $20 and 20 minutes ordering someone an envelope full of glitter.
You're really underestimating just how spiteful I can be...
If you're not motivated enough to kill someone over $10 you're not motivated enough for anything. 
if he can steal $10 he can steal all of it. I cant let him get away with stealing anymore money.
you can get a hit man for way less than $86,390.
The problem here is, yes, you can let that person slide on the BS they did, but if you don't hammer them for it, you will spend the rest of the day thinking about what you should have said. So the upshot is, hammer the mofo, then forget about it.
I would. Stealing the 10 dollars puts the 86400 in danger. Revenging will prevent that
I would
This makes it sounds like I'd get $86400 every day.  I might blow one days salary to make sure it doesn't happen again.
I wish someone would send me a massage.
Thankyou man
Absolutley fuck op and fuck the guy who stole 10$ from me
We need to create glitter dicks. A bag of fuck plus glitter. Bonus if the glitter is spring loaded leaving covered in glitter while you process that's box.
Wish I was as interesting as u
For $19 I know a guy that will kill anyone anywhere. Children, animals, old people, doesnt matter. He just loves killin'! 
"The first thing I thought when I read this was: ""Hell yeah, I would! $86,400 of revenge would be beautiful!"""
"*""You're really going to kill 5 people over $20?""*  ""Are you really asking that to the guy who just last week killed 6 people over $19?"""
The real get motivated is always in the comments.
"This great...b/c I posed the original question to my sister and her husband...and they gave your exact same response....totally negating my point and stealing the a-ha moment I was going to deliver.    So...I did what any 43 year old in that situation would do...I said, ""No, no!  You're missing the point.  Just say ""Of course I wouldn't care if someone stole $10!"""
and other people will start realizing they can get in on the action.  These people are called pushovers (until they finally snap and rampage)
Fuck a hit man. Pay a junkie like $20
Me too thanks 
I don't know why but this sounds like a sequel to the move Yes Man. Now I want to see that 
You can buy a bag of gummy candy dicks online to anonymously send to peoole and put glitter in the note and such. And the note tells them to eat a bag of dicks. 
$86,390... But I'm getting those $10 back! You can bet your sweet little ass I will!!
At this point it's just haggling. 
But that $80k budget is *per day*.  If you live to 80, that's ~0.003% of your lifetime budget.  It's worth it to send a message to those that would steal from you in the future. An investment, if you will.
In Seattle we have Dick's burgers which are fantastic especially when drunk. Telling us to eat a bag of dicks is actually a welcome suggestion. 
My mother sent one to her sister during an argument they were having. She knew exactly who it was as soon as she received it.
Plus you get another $86,400 tomorrow and every day for the rest of your life, why not spend one day's worth exacting a most glorious revenge?
There‚Äôs always a hole in my heart for Robin Williams.
Dead poets society.... One of my favorite movies ever
depression steals poetry, beauty, romance, and love
Memes, liquor, guns, and titties
Oh captain my captain!
Always thought he underrated engineering. I love a good bridge.
No actor made me laugh or cry harder than Robin Williams.
I don't know what movie this is so pardon if i mess up, but shouldn't we be praising the screenwriters? Or the writer if its based on a book?
"My one English teacher in high school would usually have movie days at the end of semester so that if we missed days of school for cancellations, we had days to make it up. I hated this man so much (not for movie selection). He would start these old movies and I would be like ""what the fuck is this corny shit"" because I already hated him. But fuck, that man had taste. He showed us Dead Poet's Society and Driving Miss Daisy. I didn't want to admit it at the time because it was him, but fuck,  those are great movies."
It doesn't steal, it only hides.
Well yeah,  Poetry = memes  Beauty = titties  Romance = also titties  Love = guns & liquor & still more titties
Dead poets society
You should praise both. It takes work to put words to a page, and work again to bring those words to life.
I can‚Äôt decide wether to /r/thathappend or /r/imverybadass
I went into this movie with no context, had no idea what is was about or what was going to happen. It fucked me up.
good fucked up or bad? I kinda like going into movies not knowing whats going on. This could be one I watch
Do it. Highly recommend.
I‚Äôve never thought of a ‚Äòsuccess timeline‚Äô. But I find myself worried I‚Äôm not doing well enough, fast enough, almost every day. 
A 27 year old girlfriend at 70 is still a 27 year old girlfriend
I dropped out of high school when I was 15, I‚Äôm 30 now and just got my GED about a month ago. There was no excitement or anything worth celebrating from the way I saw it. I was ashamed to be doing something at the age of 30 that I should have done many years ago, so I was hesitant to even tell anyone (well I still haven‚Äôt tbh) except my immediate family. Then, I started thinking that not everyone starts out on a level playing field, some people have to work harder than others for certain things, some people have obstacles to overcome and take longer than others to accomplish things and there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with that. We all have different paths and we can‚Äôt control everything life throws at us, and that‚Äôs okay 
I‚Äôve been in community college for 4 years and I just got accepted into UC Davis, thanks for posting this OP
 ‚ÄúTime isn‚Äôt precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of time: the Now. That is precious indeed.

Damn right. And a degree with a 2.5 GPA is still a degree.  A used Mercedes is still a Mercedes. Be proud of what you've acomplised and what you have. 
I'm 27 years old, and I just started back at college last fall semester. I'm only taking two classes at a time, but I also work whenever I'm not in school. I struggle wtih depression and ADHD, but I'm still managing to keep up with school somehow, even though I never really feel like I'm doing well enough. However, despite that feeling, I have a 4.0 and I'm in honors! I don't know how long it will take me to get a bachelors in mechanical engineering at this rate, but I'm surviving so far, so I just hope I make it to the end. I'm so tired of being a server.   Edit: typos
This makes me happy to read. At 39, dad of 2, six pack is still in sight.
I get that, but you have to go by your own timeline. I got a chemistry degree at 22 and spent the next 5 years not using it but dealing poker instead.  After that I decided moving back home to North Dakota to work in the oilfield was my best choice. After getting laid off 3 years on the job, decided I wanted to do more, I decided to go back and get my engineering degree. I will graduate in a few weeks at age 34 ( more than 10 years older than most of my classmates.  I got married 2 months ago to my SO of 10 years. It has been unorthodox path so far but it is working for me. 
Patrick Stewart is testament to this fact.
I‚Äôm 27. Dropped out of University and was kicked out of school. I have a nice variety of experience but a 2 year gap on my CV where I went away (prison). I start a job at McDonald‚Äôs on Wednesday. During my job hunt I realised there are Marine certifications you can literally just pay for. I‚Äôm booked on a 2 week Marine engine course in May. Full room and board (on the isle of whight)and I will return a fully MCA certified Diesel engine engineer. When I pass that one I will go on to do a few more courses which my McDonald job will pay for. The courses aren‚Äôt all that expensive and I have experience in boat building and crew experience so it‚Äôs right up my street. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve found the path I‚Äôve been struggling to find for ten years. I‚Äôm so excited about getting all these certificates and being able to apply for jobs anywhere there is a port (worldwide). Plus I think it will be quite fun working at McDonald‚Äôs for a bit. It‚Äôs 300m away from my house. It‚Äôs perfect, the stars are aligning I feel like.   Edit: Hey the UKSA just sent me my enrolment email (I literally booked the course this morning) and I got this in my wallet: https://imgur.com/a/HS3wciy  Neato!
Congrats on your GED. Don't regret progress no matter how slow.  Edit: Wow, my first gold! Thanks stranger!
The f is all these posts about Mercedes? Literally none of my successful friends have mercedes. I've never wanted one. Mercedes advertisers must be doing their overtime on reddit 
As much as I agree, I can't say I'm too comfortable with a 2.5 gpa doctor doing anything around me. 
They‚Äôre made in the kitchen, you got this!
https://i.imgur.com/GLgKNsN.jpg
Maybe not a doctor, but your life probably relies on quite a few things made and maintained by people with 2.5 GPAs. Thankfully, a GPA doesn't determine how good someone can get at specific skills.
I was gonna say this. I do this constantly and feel way better about myself. I also log less hours on Facebook so I don‚Äôt find myself comparing success with my peers. 
The only type of social media I allow myself is Reddit.  None of those people who I barely know just lurking their lives, their something amazing about no one knowing who you are that already feels less stressful and destructive of your time.
Exactly my point. reddit is by far the best social media plateform and you guys are amazing.  I love you all <3 
"Do you think this was around when he was diagnosed with lymphoma? ""I'm waiting on the good times now"" "
This makes me both happy and sad.  What a way to start a Monday
For some people, the image doesn't do this moment enough justice. So, here is the video of the moment on his show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugJfjmxOR2I

I needed this. Yesterday my girlfriend broke up with me, she was my first everything and I talked to her every day. It was all out of the blue, she just said she didn't have the same feelings for me anymore. I get that it has to happen and it's better that we aren't together if she doesn't love me.  Times suck right now. So much of my time with her is just gone now. A huge portion of my life is just missing now and I need to fill up the time I spent with her on other things somehow. She was such a big part of my life and now it's hard to just move on.   I'm happy I read this. Times suck for me right now, but hopefully I find someone that is right that is the same or better than her.
Supposedly this was around the time when his wife had been diagnosed with cancer.
But Friday is coming!
"To put this in perspective, he was going through a lot in his life at this moment. His wife was suffering from cancer and would die just 2 years after this aired. He was then diagnosed with lymphoma and would also pass away at only age 52.  He  never told anyone but his closest friends and family that he was sick and continued doing the show while still doing his best to stay focused on the good stuff.  His [tombstone](http://www.death2ur.com/bobrossgravesite.jpg) simply reads ""Bob Ross - Television Artist"" "
Haha holy shit dude was hardcore 
Did he really say this?
Good times never came, this guy is legendary. 
"Ah, I thought the ""I'm waiting for the good times now"" sounded kinda ominous. Poor guy, I know firsthand how awful cancer is. My wife has already seen me lose 30 pounds (I was not overweight) and it's really the impression that you're wasting away that's so terrifying for you and those around you."
You gotta have a Monday to appreciate a Friday. 
Bob Ross is one of the few famous people that I'd genuinely liked to have met. He seemed so genuine and goodhearted.
Bob Ross was in the Air Force for 20 years and served as the first sergeant of the U.S. Air Force Clinic at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska.
The draft.  How fortunate are we that this reference goes over our heads?
Man I'm sitting here fucking crying bro, no lie. For the past 9 day I've been feeling suicidal and today was the day I was trying to convince myself to do it and fuck    I just read your comment about climbing and bust out in tears. Thank you for writing that man. I'm gonna keep trying...
Well, the important part was he stayed positive through it all. He continued to make his show and help us all feel better and happy. I think that's what he was trying to convey.
Wishing you the best of luck with your fight, dude
A case of the Mondays gets cured by a case on Friday
Him and Fred Rogers
Can you imagine what it would be like to have Bob Ross as your commanding officer?  THERE ARE NO ERRORS, JUST HAPPY LITTLE ACCIDENTS, YOU MAGGOT!
He definitely did that for the public eye. Think painting just made him forget about his problems. That and his little friends. 
I've been looking for a third to round out the trinity of wholesomeness, but I can't quite think of anyone in that same level.
"Apparently, that's exactly what he was like. Contrary to belief, he was the guy who would bust your balls for fun.   ""I was the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work. The job requires you to be a mean, tough person. And I was fed up with it. I promised myself that if I ever got away from it, it wasn't going to be that way anymore."" http://www.military.com/veteran-jobs/career-advice/military-transition/famous-veteran-bob-ross.html "
Agreed. I experinced a loss recently and I've started painting. I'm pretty bad but it still puts me in a zone of concentration that's kind of therapeutic.
Bill Cos......fuck
Could throw Steve Irwins name in the running. 
For me, it's Jim Henson to round out that triumvirate.
Robin Williams
The good thing about painting is that it doesn't matter what others think - as long as you're happy, that's the only thing that matters.  Stay strong, my friend.
He saves.....but he rapes. But he saves a lot more than he rapes!....but he still rapes.    If you haven't watched the new Chappelle stand-up on Netflix, you should.   edit: swapped saves and rapes in the middle there  
Yep, that completes my trinity.  Wholesome dude!
So, should I pursue my dreams and become a tentacle porn artist?
He creates darkness so that you can appreciate the light you had before 
Go for it, man.  You do you.
The best response I saw to this was that people don't know if they can help you fix your car, but they know they know how to push. 
You're also less likely to be looking for murder victims if you're pushing a car rather than flagging them down
It‚Äôs an interesting phenomena for sure. I got a flat in my bike on my way to work once and no one would stop, so I said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and put it on my back and ran. I had gone about a quarter mile when a woman stopped and helped me put it in the back of her SUV. I told her about how people just drive right past and she said regrets not helping people on the side of the road and she‚Äôs going to from now on. So I guess we both helped each other a bit!
"In the same interview Chris was asked for his best kept secret: ""For years I didn't miss an episode of Sex and the City. That's probably not something a guy should brag about.""  [Source](http://www.oprah.com/spirit/chris-rock-interview-chris-rocks-best-advice#ixzz5GLJQ8uzK"")"
"Once I was biking from my university to the nearest superstore to get as many fans as I could for my airconditionless freshman dorm, it was about 95 degrees out and a 5 mile bike ride... I didnt bring any water.  On the way back I had 3 fans in my backpack and one under each arm (so im biking with no hands) I start feeling dizzy so I stop biking and try and waive down a car for a lift for the last 2 miles or so back to school. No luck. So I decide ""fuck it ill pretend im unconcious then someone will stop."" With the way I was feeling playing unconcious didn't feel at all a stretch from reality. So I lay down in the grass and scatter the boxes with fans all around me to make it look like I fell and they flew everywhere. Someone stopped within 30 seconds.  Moral of the story? If people arent stopping, maybe you aren't acting helpless ENOUGH."
This reminds me of last night kinda. I was driving by and a lady about age 35 and her 5 year old daughter we're trying to flag down people for help,looked like car trouble or out of gas. I didn't stop I feel kind of bad. What if that was my mother or sister out there?Idk now I'm just sitting here wondering what ever became of them.
This is an excellent point
Can confirm. Was once in a van full of 12 friends in Vermont when we saw two guys trying to push their car down the highway. They must have been so surprised when 10 people came out of nowhere and just started pushing their car. No words were spoken.
"""Good to know"" - serial killers"
To be honest helping others is a good way to help yourself too. It makes you feel good and that is what people need sometimes when they are feeling bad, they helped somebody and that somebody appreciated it! 
If you can spend that much on fans can‚Äôt you just use a taxi? 
I can push.
Pff, that's for like 1980's serial killers. Today's killers are high tech, and use Craigslist, facebook, and dating apps like normal people!
Until you pick up someone who says that his girlfriend left her ex bc his dick was too small and tells you that your eyes must be from amazon bc they can‚Äôt be real and now things are weird and he wants to follow u on instagram but he might kill you so what do you do then?
Sometimes there just is no money to repair or properly maintain a car. Maintenance is expensive if you're living paycheck to paycheck. It's a good example of how expensive it can be to be poor.
I truely... truely wish I had thought of that
like in a programmer sense, so command, a [push]
Well the hipsterial killers like to keep vintage/analog methods alive in the modern era.

Someone told me in the earlier episodes/seasons you see him jogging with a woman who you would assume is his wife. After a while it's just him, then he says this. I don't know if it's intentional, but it's a nice touch.
Its ironic because the show is so cynical and self-loathing, one of my favorite parts about the show are the little moments with positive people saying real shit.    Definitely not what i expected when i first started this show.
Fucking right. I've had no motivation for the gym lately because I can't lift what I used to, but this is the shit I need. Thanks OP. 
What are YOU doing here?   My reaction when Bojack is on r/GetMotivated
Here‚Äôs the thing though: this happens at the end of season 2, which ends on an optimistic note. Season 3 contains Bojack‚Äôs darkest moments. Progress with anything, especially mental health, isn‚Äôt linear. You can take take one step forward and two steps back, and that‚Äôs okay too. 
This quote saved me from suicide. I had been depressed for years, and every day just felt more grueling than the last. Then I found this show and I really resonated with Bojack‚Äôs character. When I.T got to this scene, at the end of season 2, that‚Äôs when I knew I had to fight. Thank god I got to hear this quote, and I can confirm, ever since every day has gotten a little easier :)   Don‚Äôt give up :)  Edit: Thanks so much for all the kind words! You are all amazing, and I just wanna hijack my top comment and say that I just discovered this great new Facebook messenger bot called ‚ÄúWoebot‚Äù which uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help you get through your tough times. I suggest it to anyone with Mild depression, it‚Äôs helped me so much to figure out my feelings and how to deal with them! If you‚Äôre feeling suicidal then there‚Äôs hotlines, but if everyday depression is ailing you then I really suggest using this bot. It was developed by top Stanford psychologists in behavioral therapy, and it‚Äôs great because no one ever actually reads your conversations. It‚Äôs just you and the bot, figuring out your feelings. Here‚Äôs the link for those interested :)  https://www.woebot.io
Bojack Horseman is one of the only shows which comes even close to depicting depression. I love this show. 
If it's getting easier, it means you have to get harder.
This really is true. I can't believe the progress I've made over the last few months, in all sorts of things. The hardest part is just getting started. 
"My favourite Bojak Horseman quote  ""God Dammit, Honeydew? Jesus, why does Cantaloupe think every time it gets invited to a party it can bring along its dumb friend Honeydew ? You don't get a plus one Cantaloupe.""   "
Yeah its in the flash back 80's and 90's episodes.  EDIT: https://medium.com/sitcom-world/i-have-questions-about-the-jogging-baboon-from-bojack-horseman-2a51222f7b8e
My mom died a few months ago, and one of my friends just gifted me a shirt with this phrase on it. For some twisted reason, it makes me feel a lot better to think that this might be the back story in the show, too. I'm hollow now but I know it's nothing to the devastation my dad feels. I hope it gets easier for him, too.  Maybe I should suggest he take up jogging. 
‚ÄúHey. Do you need the movie star speech?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOkay. Carolyn, you are the star of a movie. This is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken. Where the world tests you, and people treat you like shit. But it has to happen this way. Otherwise, the end of the movie, when you get everything you want, won‚Äôt feel as rewarding. There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don‚Äôt matter. Because this movie‚Äôs not about them. It‚Äôs never been about them. All this time, the movie‚Äôs been about you.‚Äù

Is this a crossover subreddit?
This^^^ we all want to take leaps and bounds, but sometimes progress means setbacks. Sometimes it means being on top of things one day, and feeling absolutely horrible the next. And most of the time, being able to keep your head up through those horrible days is what helps you the most in the long run

every month. every goddamn month. but, it's kinda a good one...
Damn. I was right. Now I'm sad :(
I'm really sorry to hear that, friend. I'm ten years on from losing my dad to suicide this year. I was just a teenager, so it messed me up pretty good, but that whole 'it gets better' bullshit turned out to, well, not be bullshit.   The effects are still there, but the pain is long gone. I think of them like a faded old scar.  Just got to take it a day at a time, and stick close to your remaining parent, if you can. You're both going through the same thing and few people will be able to help you more than you can help each other.  Good luck.  (Sorry for the impromptu Wear Sunscreen moment. Feel free to disregard.)
That‚Äôs too much, man 
You have to repost it every month, that's the hard part.
Could also just mean that in that time he mentored someone else in how to get better :)

I swear this quote is probably one of the few light points the show has.
Mr. Peanut Bitter, the happiest person who ever lived, drops this quote  https://i.imgur.com/Mr8fcg9.jpg  Well you get my point  Edit: lmao, mr. Peanut B**u**tter not Bitter
It's true. Set up a routine and get as much dopamine as you can without drugs or fast food. And stay close to your family and friends. You'll stop worrying about finding your purpose and be happy.  This is advice from North Korea defectors by the way. In an interview, they said *they* feel sorry for *us.* Imagine that. They think we complicate life and that's why we're unhappy. And they're right. 
Peanut Bitter
Don't give in to your laziness. Sitting around and doing nothing all day *sounds* nice. And it is okay every once in a while. But if that's all you're doing you're going to be miserable. Force yourself to hang out with family and make time for friends. Find at least one hobby and try to dedicate a few hours a week to it.   I think the best way though is to volunteer. Volunteering makes you feel great! And you meet other cool people. And you're doing a great thing for your community. And it looks good on your resume.  We're in a get motivated sub so this is perfect. Because the truth is, you're always going to be depressed unless you give it an honest shot to get out of it. And that's why depression is terrible. It's because it tells you you won't get out of it. For example, the reason anti-depressants have a side affect of suicide isn't because it tampers with chemicals in your brain. It's because it gives you the motivation to finally do it. The only thing stopping a lot of people with depression is a lack of motivation. So you have to force yourself to make an honest effort every day. And just like the quote above, it really does get easier. 
Nutty Professor 3: The Wedding
They joy on his face, is absolutely delightful!
About 10 years ago, in the last wedding of the year that I conducted, the groom was 70 and the bride was 74. They were widowed and had been friends for some time. Just the families would attend, I was told. That turned out to be a lot of people, and with grandbabies running up and down the aisles, it was quite a lively affair, and very poignant.

As a 35 year old trying to apply to medical school, thank you!  Edit: holy moly, thank you all for the encouragement! I appreciate it! 
I really needed this. I'm still trying to finish up my bachelor's while working full time at 24, and feel like my friends are way ahead of me. I know people say don't  compare yourself to others but it's easier said than done. Just have to keep pushing forward.   edit: Wow this gained a lot more traction then I thought.

I had taken a hiatus from social media, celebrity gossip and reddit for 3 weeks. Today is only my 3rd time back on this website. I took the break because i felt i was failing, I wasn‚Äôt accomplishing the things I need to accomplish as fast as I should have, I took longer in school etc. i was feeling defeated and shit really. I needed this. This was beautiful. Everything we do is right because we are living our life. There is no wrong. Everything that brought us here happened for some reason, be it your decisions another‚Äôs decisions, and if you believe, Gods decision. There is nowhere else you are supposed to be other than right here. Hell, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt even exist but you do and it has brought you to this specific time and point. Every moment is your moment and you live it to its fullest or to its littlest. It is your life, one that is unique, short and only happens once.

One of the pathologists I work with didn‚Äôt go to med school until her mid 30s. She‚Äôs probably in her 60s now and she‚Äôs one of the most brilliant docs I know! 
As a 19 year old that's about to be a semester behind on his 4 year after failing my first class ever I appreciate this too.

"I got a bachelor's by 25. Didn't do anything with it. Fucked off for a few more years before I got an associate's in the medical field at 31. I love my job now. Take your time and don't do anything you know you'll hate.  Ten years from now when your my age, and REALLY just starting to feel like you should be an adult, you'll realize how young you were at 24.   I hope this didn't sound too much like gatekeeping. I don't mean to say ""oh yeah? Wait till you 34!!"" I just mean you're young, even if it doesn't feel like it. And if it's family/friends pressure you feel to rush success, just find role models that started late. Or failures that started early.  And also know that ""more successful"" people are often jealous of your lifestyle. The grass isn't always greener. The important thing is to be a good person, and people respect and need that more than anything."
I guess you're right, conquest of the China can wait.
PRECISELY WHEN HE MEANS TO
Decided to go to med school when I was 30. But I had a degree in philosophy and almost no science coursework so I had to go back first to do all of my prerequisite science work. I almost died of anxiety when I didn‚Äôt get in the first year I applied to med school, but it all worked out because the next year I got into the program I really wanted to go to. Am currently about to finish my third year.  Will be 39 when I graduate and start residency.   Medical school is great, and coming to it with a little age and life experience puts you at a huge advantage  both in terms of your motivation and focus, but also just being able to talk with patients.   Good luck!

You're gonna turn 36 whether or not you go to school. The choice is yours, if you're going to be an RN by then or not.  My mom started college at 36 and graduated with her BSN at almost 40. Now she's an RN in a cardiovascular ICU. Dream it, do it.
Good shit my guy

That motivated me more than the post (which was quite motivating).

For every success story, there are thousands of failed ones; yet to become successful, someone has to be 100% committed, which is a big gamble given the chances of failing. So does one settle for an average life, or does one gamble and aim for the top of the top knowing failure is likely.
"This is for the people who say, ""Ya, I want to start working out again but I just can't afford a gym membership."""
That look on his face. Pure physical/mental exhaustion that is almost blissful at the end of a brutally productive workout.
Also, didn't he begin fighting at 14 (maybe younger in ameaturs) to bring home food for his family?  
Winston Churchill's definition of success......Going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.
All of that hard work just to get robbed of his welterweight belt at the age of 38 in one of the worst hometown decisions of the last decade.
It's inspiring to imagine how much he wanted to be a national champion. He took the scraps of bikes to make a machine just to improve... amazing.

"When some rich fuck says they came from nothing, this is what they should mean. This is nothing and he climbed up and made it.

Floyd will never be loved like Manny. 
This boy would go on to become the first and only octuple champion boxer to have won titles in 8 different weight classes. He is also currently a Senator in the Philippines.  
You can see the pain/tiredness on his face, he pushed himself at such a young age and continues to do it to this day, he such a role model for an inspiring human to be the best that they can be.
The people who don't become professional athletes don't fail. They learn work ethic, build physical strength, etc. something philosophical about a journey instead of destination.
Gamble, because even if you fail you've still gained so much. It's not usually a decision where you gamble for greatness and if you fail you die or become homeless. It's usually just regret you'll deal with, and if you can take that, you'll be a better person because of it.
Exaclty, push ups, pull ups, sit ups, sprints. 
He probably just started and was thinking about going home to play switch and eat hot Cheetos 
He also had a dead-beat drunk father who would beat him. His dog, who he loves and plays with a lot was killed and eaten(pulutan or side-food, snack while drinking alcohol) by his father when he was just a kid. He had to endure the difficulties of poverty and was forced to grow up at such a young age to provide for himself and his family.
Started boxing pro at sixteen but was too small to fight at the lowest weight class in boxing which was 105lbs. Supposedly he would attach weights to his feet to make weight. But yeah to give you an idea of how special he was he started boxing bellow 105lbs and won titles from 109lbs all the way up to 154lbs. 
Yep
7 billion dollars Philippine Pesos?
Churchill was fucking METAL 
> He took the scraps of bikes to make a machine just to improve... amazing.  you know this is a boxing gym right? as in he didn't make this not machine. there is a trainer right next to him.
i think at that age he was just trying to get paid to feed his family.

>ghetto  Do you know his background? He quite literally was dirt poor.
He also grew up to be incredibly intolerant of homosexuals, going on to state that they were no different from animals.
He shouldve just stayed as a boxer. His reputation is pretty much ruined ever since he became a political figure. He is a bigot who also only relies on biblical quotes as his main source for debates. 
Journey before destination
Yeah or they develop physical trauma that handicaps them for life. I enjoy a success story but let's not pretend every non-success is still wholesome. There's a reason pros are paid so much and part of that is because it's a huge risk getting to the top.
"""Mmmmm cheesy, crunchy and spicy. One more rep and I'm carb binging!"" "

He also lied about his age, didn't he? He was too young to fight but lied in order fight and earn money. 
Yes
"pretty sure he was just referring to when people from wealthy/middle class backgrounds say they ""came from nothing""  but ok"
Yeah the Philippine government is run on money and connections. Sounds familiar....
So, a typical politician
I feel like he's a great role model in other ways regardless.  Your opinion on his religious views and the way he practices them are yours, and I share the same belief that it isn't right to be against gay people. But this is a getmotivated post, people should look to what they can on an individual to be motivated.   For example, aspects of Mother Teresa and Lance Armstrong could be viewed negatively, but if you choose to look at what you think is good and inspirational, you only have something to gain.   We do pick and choose our role models though. Just realize that everyone has a side that could be viewed as negative to another person. To a very strict conservative catholic, his vocalization on denouncing homosexuals could be viewed as honorable and respectable. It isn't the norm from where I'm from and I don't agree with it, but consider the Philippines and its religious climate.   As someone who overall thinks of Manny as a great inspiration of hard work and dedication, decent family man, an admired pinoy amongst his countrymen, I'd rather defend him being in this subrreddit. 
Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.

You're getting downvoted but you're not wrong even in democracies.  Let's look at the USA. How many son of presidents have become president? How many family dynasties are there?

Get help, man. Finally succumbing to my own pride and asking for help started the path to recovery for me
You‚Äôre an amazing human. Keep up the good work.
Lots of sunflower seeds. An ungodly amount
Good reddit
Now, imagine if we thought this way about everyone, every day, on and off the internet. People who AREN'T crying out for help...those we see on the street who look perfectly fine. Its easy to judge...but everyone has something going on, a struggle.   Edit: It makes my heart happy that my most upvoted comment is about being kind to others. Thank you Reddit friends for the silver and gold, now go pass that kindness on to others irl! 
"The ultimate roast ""You look like your life is such a mess, we wont even let you play along with us"" "
Thats some good shit reddit. Gives me hope that people really aren't so shit.

The internet needs to know. To the front page!!
Ohana means family and family means nobody gets left behind
it's true, those eyes look like he's really ready to end it all. I'm glad decent redditors came out with their support. 
I think this is the first roastme I‚Äôve ever read. I find the concept kind of gross so never had time for it but I‚Äôm glad it isn‚Äôt that bad and that there are decent humans hanging around, brightening the place up. Still won‚Äôt participate though. I hope that fellow got help. Like they said, depression is no joke. Been clawing my way out of it for a while now. 
>buddy, you stumbled into a pit of some of the most vicious vipers on the internet  pump the brakes superchief /r/roastme isn't THAT clever
I‚Äôve been watching that post and OP hasn‚Äôt commented back but /u/midnightmodding claims to live in the same building, maybe he might have an update. 
REALLY REALLY GOOD REDDIT
We're not all going through the same thing, but we're all going through something.
"Yeah, I mean not to turn this around into a 'woe is me' story, but I've suffered from depression for most of my life and would spend most of the day with the same ""not quite right"" look of the guy in the picture. No one reached out to me.  Admittedly that has made me kind of bitter and cynical, but I try my best to go against those feelings and reach out to those who look like they could be suffering the same way  Edit: Thanks for all the kind words, but as I said I don't want to hijack this thread and make it all about me. The commenter above me is right - there are hundreds of people out there that you wouldn't even know are suffering. It's not fair for me to steal the focus away from them."
Damm that‚Äôs so true
"That was my thought.  Like, ""you look so pathetic that you might be the first, only, and last person we've decided - collectively - we cannot roast"".  Could backfire.  Obviously I don't think that's the intention, but it's one interpretation, and might end up being OPs."
They're really not! In every single disaster, natural or humanmade, you can always find people trying to help when they can. It's not always perfect, but you'll always see the people reaching out. As bleak as news is, it's just entertainment to fill between ad time. Go outside and fall in front of people. Go to a hospital to see nurses working 13 hour shifts just to help. People, at their base, help others. Have a really good day, brother.
Sort by controversial to see the actual roasts... they‚Äôre harsh 
Hope this reaches r/all
Or forgotten.
"Man that's the real roast. ""Bro you have soulless eyes"""
Roasting is entirely surface level and should not be mean spirited.  It's all in good fun and should always be consented to.  There really is nothing gross about it. 
r/toastme?
I hope the anti-roast was successful in at least making him re-assess some things!
Except Piers Morgan.
This is actually a pretty regular thing for /r/roastme though.  Most cases if someone comes there with a... questionable title like this, the sub refuses to roast them and instead urges them to get help.
>There was something else my mother did that I‚Äôve always remembered: ‚ÄúAlways look for the helpers,‚Äù she‚Äôd tell me. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always someone who is trying to help.‚Äù I did, and I came to see that the world is full of doctors and nurses, police and firemen, volunteers, neighbors and friends who are ready to jump in to help when things go wrong.

was just thinking that. how do people come up with that shit hahah
**UPVOTE EVERYONE, WE NEED TO SAVE HIM AND OTHERS**  Edit: I was depressed to death last year, I couldn't imagine I'd get better. Rejection, addiction, pain and loneliness. I got help, I went to therapy, I reached out to others and I looked within. I'm better now, I see my worth and I'm making progress. 
"I mean, every single post of a woman is ""you think you're hot, but you're actually just a simpering mess of daddy issues whose life will be ruined when your good looks fade because you offer nothing to the world"" but... In theory, yes.  EDIT: Thank you for the gold from the anonymous stranger! In the spirit of /r/wholesomememes: you are all lovely, sweet, and thoughtful. I hope you have a fabulous rest of the day and enjoy a nice meal this weekend. :)"
We need an r/antiroast in this guys honor.   Edit: It has been pointed out that r/Toastme is a thing. Thanks guys!
Something sure is going through him though.
Half the rules section is suicide prevention and depression resources for that very reason. Roasting people with depression or suicidal thoughts is against the unwritten rules of the sub.
I think the only reason /r/roastme doesn't bug me is because people go in asking for it. Its not like they pick random people off the internet and just bully them without constent.  If you post on /r/roastme you either think you are above criticsm or you are in on the joke and love being poked fun at.
r/toastme 
There's /r/toastme
He didn‚Äôt fail at getting roasted, he succeeded in bringing out the best of Reddit, quite an accomplishment, if you ask me. 
Also r/tributeme

Real Relationship Goals:  He knew she was hot, because he still hasn't gotten the air conditioner in her car fixed.
Fuck, I'm lonely 
Wait, what cant op believe she actually did?
Why do they go through the drive way separately?
Haha me and my gf do this all the time                    Jk I don‚Äôt have one pls help 
Ok but imagine if someone cut between them at the last second and the husband didn't even realize and he still tried to pull this move.
I‚Äôm sorry. But using @ for ‚Äúat‚Äù is moderately annoying to read. 
I did something similar one time. I pulled up and paid for my wife who was behind me. I told the dude to give her my number if she was hot. He gave her my number. But to be fair, if I was him, I would‚Äôve given her the number no matter what. 
What if... hear me out... she was SO flattered that she quickly convinced herself to marry this guy and jumped straight into calling him her husband
"Real talk. My wife and I are going through a serious rough patch. The last few years haven't been great, honestly. Without getting into all the details, we've dealt with my alcoholism and deeply hidden anxiety issues that grew exponentially when I sobered up. Those things, and my lack of effort to correct them, pushed her away, to the point of cheating on me. Which was a regrettable thing, but I have a history of cheating (before marriage, mind), so we've been trying to work through it. I'm mature enough and committed enough to want to give it an honest and sincere try. For my wife, my family, and my sanity.   I've been focused on bettering myself these past few weeks so I can be a better husband for her. It's been working. I'm a better person than I was even a month ago. And she noticed.  We had our ""first date"" tonight. And it went better than I could have hoped for. Way better. We never stopped loving each other, but tonight helped rekindle that spark. We're falling in love all over again. After 15 years together, we're getting to know each other again. And I'm just eating it up.  I guess my point is that all the cutesy stuff like Mr Drive Thru here matters. A lot. We both forgot that along the way, but we're starting to remember. So the real relationship goal is to find someone that makes you want to be a better person - *and actually motivated enough to follow through on that*. I'm so glad I get this opportunity to date her again, to get to know her all over again. And to show her that all the bullshit is *entirely* worth it.  Ramble, ramble. I'm just in a supremely good place right now, all because we're trying to remember these kinds of small-but-important gestures of love and appreciation."
Wife: I heard you called me hot at the drive thru :)  Husband: *thought it was someone else*
r/absolutelynotme_irl
I'm having trouble with the title. What did she do that OP is surprised about?
Aww
Man is also probably a dad.
If I said I‚Äôll get it fixed, I‚Äôll get it fixed. You don‚Äôt have to remind me every six months. 
Fuck, you're on Reddit a lot.
Can we be lonely... together?
OP can't believe that the drive-thru person actually told the lady in the car behind the guy that the guy thought she was hot.
‚ÄúIt‚Äù
Deliver the message.
On their way to work, at separate jobs?
Maybe going somewhere seperately but left at same time. Happens a lot when you have kids. One example is the husband going to work and the wife doing errands with the kids.
Maybe they were driving through somewhere and needed two cars? 
Step 1. Spend less money on sneakers   Step 2. Not sure what the next step is 
"Several years ago my wife and I were both going to meet at the same bar.  She was driving, I was walking from a separate location.  She got there first, but knew I wouldn't be that far behind her.  When she ordered her beer, she said ""And I'll pay for a drink for the handsome man that's about to walk through that door.  Obviously, that was some other dude.  So she bought his beer and mine.   "
It's probably used just to make sure the tweet fits under the character limit.
How does this work logistically? How can they charge your card if you have it back already?
Man is also probably not hot.
Or a mom.
Fuck, I'm lonely 
Let's make a lot of plans, struggle to fulfill them, cancel them five minutes before, and be glad that we don't need to make human contact until tomorrow!
anything to spice up an underpaid job. 
, lol.
Sounds plausible.
Or the wife also going to work. 
Step 3. Repeat Step 1   Step 4. Profit
Guess I‚Äôm staying single 
And called me hot, compliments are priceless
I used to hate this, then I traveled internationally where I had to pay per text, so i had2 type lik dis2 not go over d limit and I felt like I was having a stroke.  But I didn't go over the limit so that was nice.
Well, the person has to have ordered already for it to work. So they just run the transaction while the person is waiting behind you. If they haven‚Äôt already ordered, it really wouldn‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt think.

My favorite scene of the movie!  He may be a jerk to Peter, but he's not going to sell him out to the bad guy. He's a jerk with principles!
Does anyone have a link to the comic where it is revealed that Jameson is just buying the pictures to look out for peter and ends with him googling and finding out peter's uncle died?
It's not that he was covering for spider man, he was covering for Peter. He still hates spidey, he just didn't want his employee to get hurt.
Honestly, in the comics JJ finds out that Peter is Spider-Man and absolutely turns his life around for Pete's sake and it is so wholesome, he's actually a really good guy
I feel like this was one of the big themes of the Raimi Spiderman Films; that all the people who are gruff and unpleasant in Peter's life all are good people when it counts.    Jonah Jameson would have died to protect Peter when assaulted by the Goblin, the New Yorkers attack the Goblin by throwing everything they can at him from the bridge, telling the Goblin that Spidey is one of them.  The people that he saves in the train protect his identity and stand between him and Doc Ock to protect him.  Peter's Slavic landlord that harasses him worries for him and tells everyone how good a kid he is in Spiderman 3.    I don't think that Flash Thompson is well featured after Peter leaves highschool in the Raimi films, but in the comics it is demonstrated that the jock that tries to bully Peter always wanted to be a hero and just needed the right example.  Spiderman becomes his idol, and he later becomes close friends with Peter, and becomes rather heroic himself in a quieter more realistic way.  (Until the Agent Venom storyline, then he becomes a legitimate superhero.)  I think that the films were trying to make a point about how people are inherently good, and worth protecting, even if they don't seem so on the surface.
Is*, even with blowing Pete's cover.
J Jonah Jamison is a fucking journalist and he will NEVER give up a source
He‚Äôs a dick to Peter but god damn he is a good man.

[The best JJJ moment from the comics. When he realizes he's been wrong about Spider-Man the entire time.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30334/2970492-ult8.jpg)
The moment this happened, my respect for him shot through the roof.
I don't get it :/
I think [this](http://i.imgur.com/7eyrZ.png) is still one of my favorite things anyone ever wrote about JJJ's opinion on Parker, despite the fact that it's in a 4chan format
Yes....He loved the NEWS!!!
Jameson is an asshole, but he's also an ethical journalist.
Professionals have standards!
"My favorite part in the trilogy is when spiderman is gone... he says he sorry, and expresses what a hero he was... and the second spiderman comes back, he goes ""HE's A MENACE"" Such a great character"
[Probably the best JJJ moment from the comics.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30334/2970492-ult8.jpg)
Yep. Here it is: https://imgur.com/gallery/zcSRU1D
I have it but I don't remember the issue, I can tell you later when I get home.
I don‚Äôt know about the Uncle Ben part, but this definitely happened in the Civil War comic when Peter reveals his identity to the public.  Jonah goes on about how he felt the ultimate betrayal from this, because he always thought in this messed up world that Peter was genuinely one of the good ones. He mentioned he always bought Peter‚Äôs shots even if they weren‚Äôt always good just to help him out.
I don‚Äôt have a link, but I‚Äôve always enjoyed that JJJ is an unimaginable asshole who is good at heart and is a journalist with standards. Always makes me smile and one of my favorite comic book side characters, he‚Äôs too fucking ridiculous.  *Strongly* recommend the Chip Zdarsky Peter Parker run - Jameson finds some things out about Spidey and suddenly becomes his most vehement supporter, in the most obnoxious JJJ way. The annual where he has to reckon with his past creating the Spider-Slayer program and other past mistakes is straight FIRE.
Jonah is deep down a good guy. He's very pro Mutant rights and civil rights in general, he just doesn't like vigilantes
Ya, but he fired Peter every time he saw him.
I mean it's pretty clear he was negative to Peter as well. It's less to do with Spider-Man and more to do with Jameson's character.
JJ has really only been a bad guy when he‚Äôs either wrong about something or protecting his family. Really not a bad guy, and Parker knows it.
Do you remember which comics?
>for Pete's sake  I think that's the first time I've ever seen that phrase used actually talking about someone named Pete
On the other hand I really enjoy his recasting in Far From Home as as the host of a Infowars-style show.
Agent Venom quickly became my favorite incarnation of Venom!  It's a neat take on addiction and the highs/lows that come with it for a comic book.
Flash Thompson is at Harry's funeral in Spider-man 3
Yeah he‚Äôs trying to get the truth to the people and got half false information from what he knows to be a trustworthy source
Reminds me of Leo Szilard.  He was the man responsible for the atomic bomb. His theories convinced the other far more well known scientists like Einstein, Teller, and Oppenheimer. They intensely hated him but looked up to his intelligence. They called him the most intelligent man they had ever met.   But he was a massive asshole and everyone hated him. They couldn‚Äôt stand him. He was repulsive.  After the atomic bomb was successful and the war ended, most of the European scientists were unable to see their families because they came from nations which became the Soviet zone after the war, and the Soviets had rounded up the scientist‚Äôs families in Prison camps to interrogate them about their relative‚Äôs work on the American atomic bomb project.   Most of the scientists were forced to flee the Nazis 10+ years earlier and leave their extended families behind. Many of their remaining family members died during the war, and most of the survivors fell into Soviet hands. The scientists were desperate to finally see their surviving families again and save them from the Soviet prison camps.   The scientists tried to get the Soviets to release their families but they refused.   But after the other scientists repeatedly failed to get their families released by the Soviets, Leo walked up to the Hungarian ambassador who was with the Soviet delegation, and said something to him in Hungarian.   Apparently the Soviets owed him a favor and he used it to get the families released.   Decades later Teller almost cried when he was interviewed about it. He hated Leo but he was overwhelmingly grateful for being able to see his dying mother and for having his sister freed as well. Hes not a very emotional man, but he clearly becomes emotional when recalling what Szilard did for him.   Szilard ended up dedicating the remainder of his life to cooperation and peace between the US and Soviet Union, and was responsible for the ‚Äúred phone‚Äù nuclear hotline being set up in order to allow conflict to be avoided during emergency situations.   Who would have thought such a hated person would end up being such a peacemaker?
Later on in that same series when Peter dies I think there is a full page or even 2 page spread of JJ starting a memorial article on him but he keeps breaking down and starting over because it's not a good enough eulogy for Peter
Peter Parker was his employee and photographer who gave him the pictures but he didn't snitch.
And his son. You know, the astronaut
I remember in the old animated series from the 90s, when new evidence came out that revealed Eddie Brock was lying, he publicly denounced his role in the misinformation campaign and withdrew his reward for the apprehension of spiderman. JJJ is a lot of things, but when it comes to journalism, he is true to the code.
>Spider-Man wasn't trying to attack the city, he was trying to save it. That's slander.  >**J. Jonah Jameson** : It is not. I resent that. Slander is spoken. In print, it's libel.

"I thought that was fan-made when I first saw the second page.  I'm kind of confused now how the photo quality of Peter's pics matches now with what other people could get. Since normally villains will funnily enough go after Peter because they think he must be friends with Spiderman in order to take pictures that good (""He's obviously posing for these!"")."
Straight to the top with this one
This hits me hard. I worked at the local paper when I lost my sister to... newsworthy circumstances.  Of course we had to run a story. My editor basically forced me to stay home for a week despite me being an integral part of putting the paper together.  JJJ is one hell of a journalist. Whoever wrote him gets it.
Hopefully I remember to check this so I can read this issue... Remember!!!
Tbh peters running a scam
Wait he was pro mutant rights? I admit I haven‚Äôt gone into the comics but I would‚Äôve thought I‚Äôd hear about this somewhere.   The vigilante thing though makes perfect sense.
I mean, he does damage other peoples property to stop muggers. probably doing more cost in damage than was being stolen. And since he's never held accountable for it, does insurance even cover that damage? So even though crime goes down, a lot of people probably pay more in insurance.  Not to mention how villians wreck half the neighbourhood every time they try to find him.   HE IS A MENACE!
And rehired him the next second/minute/day.
I know, and (spoiler alert) actually is a part of his family later on
I think there‚Äôs a dorkly video about it hold on  Edit: [here it is](https://youtu.be/rjJkTN2Gm7Q)
Chip Zdarsky‚Äôs run on Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man. Issue #6, ‚ÄòMy Dinner with Jonah,‚Äô is when he reveals his identity.  It‚Äôs a great issue and there‚Äôs some really good stuff between them for the rest of that run and continuing (here and there) into the current Amazing Spider-Man run by Nick Spencer.
Jimothy Johnny Jameson
He's a lawful good type through and through. He doesn't want to unmask spiderman because he's evil, he wants to do it because Spiderman is a masked vigilante and isn't accountable to anyone and that goes against JJ's core beliefs as a journalist that power should have a check on it. But as we see in the op, he would also give his life to protect those around him. He's a strong character and I like him because he shows that just because a character is mean or short tempered, doesn't mean they aren't good.
Fantastic line.
Simmons will always be my definitive jjj
I didn't say he was a *good* journalist.

"I took it to refer to the quality of his photos in general compared to the photo department. Not that other people are getting better photos of Spider-Man just that the best photos of Spider-Man are ""amateur hour"""
It's probably a reference to the actual quality of the photo - a lot of professional photographers don't just point and shoot, they also put in hours in editing processes to adjust for lighting, framing, angles, and other aspects of a photograph.
Meehhh I wouldn‚Äôt call it that. JJJ asked for pictures of Spider-Man and that‚Äôs exactly what he got
There‚Äôs a comic [here](https://imgur.com/a/hgHyy).
He‚Äôs pro-mutant in the sense of that he believes the law protects (or should protect) everyone, no exceptions. And it‚Äôs the no exceptions bit that causes his friction with vigilantes.  https://m.imgur.com/a/hgHyy
He was a tsundere

JJ: ...Dad?  Spider-Man: ...Son?
Also he was comically mean to Peter in every exchange they had, so one would think JJJ would snitch.

Hea the epitome of 'good is not always nice.'  Also I'm gonna have to start using him as an example of lawful good
As an inspiring journalist,  i love this!  Edit: aspiring,  not inspiring. Not off to a good start guys...
In two months 1990 will have been 30 years ago. Think that qualifies as old.
He's everybody's, supposedly that's why they haven't put jjj in the newer spider man films.
But deep inside he knows that peter is the best one he's ever had üòÑ
He is a good journalist. He is not always a good human being though.
Have a plan to kill everyone you meet.
Yes, Magneto messes up the earth's gravitational field and causes worldwide cataclysm. In this case, Manhattan is hit by a huge tidal wave.
He sent it by breaking a dam by manipulating Thor‚Äôs hammer. Not correcting you, I just think it‚Äôs too cool to leave out
Definitely amateur level photography when he started and hopefully got better as time went on.
"Reminds me of the ""Negative Exposure"" storyline.  A rival photographer is angry that Peter's pictures keep making it to the front page.  He's a photography snob and thinks his own pictures deserve it because they have better composition, etc, while Peter just seems to be pointing and shooting.  So the photographer teams up with Doc Ock to take down Spider-Man.  Doc Ock betrays him, and in a last ditch effort to redeem himself, the photographer tears off Ock's goggles and uses his camera flash to blind him.  From his prison cell, he sees that one his photos finally made the front page - but it's the one he took to blind Doc Ock.  And since he just pointed and shot without regard for the composition, it ended up looking just like one of Peter's photos.  That's just from memory, but I think that's how it went."
Of course. Mandatory bereavement. I tried to argue I didn‚Äôt even need time off but he wasn‚Äôt having any of it.   For some reason my worker bee brain decided the best thing would be to just go into work and continue with my routine, but he set me straight. I was feeling guilty as hell because I basically designed half the paper, but he found someone to make it work.

My grandma used to knit obsessively but as she got older her hands and eyesight wouldn't allow it.  Her last unfinished projects were a set of matching cable scarves in colors for each season for her two identical twin sons.  She passed away, my dad's brother passed away.  Dad asked me what I wanted of my grandma's things.  I wanted her knitting supplies.  I finished the scarves and sewed them into a blanket for my dad for his birthday.  edit: thank you wholesome ~~person~~ people <3
We prefer the term knittas
Heteronormative ways are old school. A man that knits is a good husband.
"I'm a dude that knits. The knitting bug usually strikes me when it starts to get cold out, but me and my group of friends already have every single article I/they would need knitted. So I would buy some cheap yarn and knit on the subway (NYC) and when a person in need would come through the train with the usual ""excuse me ladies and gentlemen..."" I would hand them a hand-knitted beanie...I have never experienced that level of gratitude in my life. ""You made this?!? For me?""...""yea.. For you.""   The smelliest and most satisfying hugs ever. Usually tears were involved"
My wife does some kind of craft like that, though I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs knitting.  I‚Äôve always thought that one of these days it would be fun to try my hand at it.  Like when we are watching a show to have us both sitting there knitting away.

There are people that knit/crochet hats or scarves and leave them in public with a note (usually says something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lost! Take this if you feel cold‚Äù). Perhaps try that too? I‚Äôve put crocheted hats in ziplock bags and hung them in trees for people to take.
What tools does she work with? Two or more needles (sticks with pointy ends) and yarn? A hook and yarn? A sewing needle, colorful thread, woven through fabric? In order, those are knitting, crochet, and embroidery/cross stitch.  You should totally try a crafty hobby! I‚Äôm a knitter and I love having something productive to fidget with while watching tv/movies.

All these spheres are made of asbestos, by the way. Keeps out the rats. Let us know if you feel a shortness of breath, a persistent dry cough, or your heart stopping. Because that's not part of the test. That's asbestos.   Good news is, the lab boys say the symptoms of asbestos poisoning show a median latency of forty-four point six years, so if you're thirty or older, you're laughing.

We can all learn from each other in general. Not that any culture is perfect but each culture has a fair share of good and bad traits that defines them.

Likewise, Japan isn‚Äôt perfect either and is xenophobic in culture despite being very respectful and honorable to us. I just want to put this out there because while Japan has really great cultural values that I love, I won‚Äôt pretend that they are a perfect ideal that we should strive for.

Just watch a documentary on her last night. They used the recordings from her interviews with Andrew Morton. She was so amazing. She could also empathize because she was isolated and left out in her own within the royal family.  Edit: for everyone asking, it was Diana: In Her Own Words a n Disney+.  Highly recommend it.
It's difficult to put into perspective how radical of a statement this was at the time. There are *still* people who think HIV is an automatic death sentence, and it shows we have a long way to go educating people on the reality of this disease.
The Queen of Hearts.  I actually cried when she passed away.
She was one of the few good ones
I don‚Äôt usually like the Royals, but Reddit needs to put Princess Di in the same tier as Bob Ross and Steve Irwin. Such a wonderful woman.
I‚Äôm ashamed to say I once got awkward when a guy with HIV shook my hand. He was collecting for charity on the street and asked to speak with me. As he shook my hand, he said ‚Äúmy name is ‚Äî- and I‚Äôm HIV positive‚Äù and I nervously looked down at our hands.  I knew better than that. But I still did it for some reason. It happened over 16 years ago, and it still makes me cringe
I remember 21 jump street did an episode on a kid in school that had aids and how he was an outcast - though as I child watching it I remember I wouldn‚Äôt share a drink with them - not so much worrying about catching aids but getting cold sore, colds etc... but yeah back in the day AIDS was really scary while politicians (Ronald R) turned their backs for a long time so for Dianna to speak out was pretty powerful,
My sister was HIV positive at the time and later died of complications of AIDS. I'll forever be grateful to Princess Diana for her compassion during this awful time in my life.
The reddit community reveres bob ross. Steve Irwin  Stan lee. Etc. I believe we need to put Diana up there.  Amazing human, people!!!
Who is she?  Edit: Ty all for responses
Why was she isolated in the Royal family?  Edit: and why do my dumb questions get upvoted so much? Reddit is so fickle.
And also about how to cope with and help the people who have it.
Not only do we have amazing treatments for HIV, we now have PrEP. A drug to take daily, and it near perfectly prevents you to get HIV through any form of sex (70% prevention through shared needles).  It is highly recommend that most gay men and other higher risk individuals take it so we can stop this epidemic.
Normally when I shake people they punch me  (on a more serious note, totally agree with you, just couldn't resist the joke)
I was in a gay bar on the west coast and around midnight the club turned off the music, the lights went up, and the TVs went to the news. Nobody complained, we all just stood there unmoving forever, watching the footage unfold. She was loved, absolutely loved. I still miss her.
I bought a lifesized inflatable model of ET for the gates of her home.
and they killed her for it.
Honestly if Diana hadn't been a royal, I would literally not give 2 shits about royalty. For people of a certain age, we remember this stuff. Like, it was radical of her to take such a stance. HIV was legit tf terrifying back then, and it's only now getting to the point people don't freak out over it. She's undoubtedly in Bob, Steve, and Alex Trebek category, in fact she's the queen of that group.
If it makes you feel any better it probably doesn't even register in terms of reactions he got from telling people that, at least you knew better than a lot of other people did
She was Princess Diana, she was amazingly dedicated to doing humanitarian work around the world, helping hundreds of thousands of people.
Lady Diana, first wife of Prince Charles. She died in 1997, in a car ‚Äûaccident‚Äú, when paparazzi chased her and her boyfriend through Paris.  She was a kind hearted woman who cared for the children of the planet.  Edit: typo
Wow it‚Äôs weird to me that we‚Äôre at a point where not everyone knows Princess Diana by looking at her... strange how things change like that. Not a knock on you, just interesting
Me too! I'm glad they chose David instead.
"They needed a young, inoffensive virgin to marry into the family so they picked her despite Charles being in love with Camilla.  Once she was married in, they never taught her Royal protocol, so whenever she messed up they'd ridicule and shame her. The tabloids did the same. She was under intense scrutiny without anyone showing her what to do. And the Royals did nothing to help with the intense paparazzi that were harassing her. Charles neglected her to cheat with Camilla (even writing her love letters during their honeymoon). Meanwhile Diana had to pretend everything was perfect between them.  Diana was very depressed and developed a horrible eating disorder.  She couldn't leave to make friends (she couldn't talk freely for fear of her issues making it to the tabloids), and every move she made outside the palace was documented by the paparazzi. When she asked the Queen what to do about her loveless marriage, the Queen basically shrugged and said ""I don't know"". Diana attempted suicide by throwing herself down the stairs, and even cut herself in front of the Queen in desperation as a cry for help. The Queen labeled her as unstable and tried to avoid seeing her completely (except for public events). Once Diana got divorced she found her strength and freedom, but was still isolated  due to the pressure of the paparazzi (as she had become so insanely popular for standing up to the Royal family... She was the most photographed woman in the world when she died, taking the title from Marilyn Monroe, and to this day is still second to the Queen).  She started doing charity work because she figured if her every move would be documented, she could shine a light on worthy causes, like HIV and the threat of landmines.  Edit; [Here's a video of her walking through a landmine area](https://youtu.be/Ua4c_7uyjx8). They begged her not to because it was too risky, but she insisted. And when the cameras didn't get the right shot, *she did it again*. I'm just posting this to show you how badass she was when it came to representing her causes."
They didn‚Äôt like her and also didn‚Äôt stand up for her against the press. It‚Äôs similar to how Meghan Markle is treated
She always referred to herself as 'different' because she doesn't really identify with the Family or their 'rules'; one of the most famous [interviews of her is her stating this exact fact](https://youtu.be/7jR52mrlvkg?t=7).
San Francisco is an interesting case study. Once the epicenter of new HIV cases, they've aggressively embraced PrEP and actually have a chance to virtually eliminate new cases on the path they're on.
I think you meant to type ‚Äústop‚Äù haha
>It is highly recommend that most gay men and other higher risk  Just gay men that have non monogamous unprotected sex. I don't know the numbers but I would guess that most gay men don't fall into that category.
"I was watching Happy Days on Nick at Nite. They preempted the show and I just sat there with my jaw on the floor... one of those ""where were you when..."" moments in history, for sure."
It's too bad, so many people get killed for the right thing, they die helping others.   Imagine if Diana wasn't there, I think the Royal family would be irrelevant too. Her sons are definitely trying to fill her place
The two main causes I know she was very outspoken about were HIV/AIDS and landmine removal.  She was tremendously brave and kind.
It hurts my heart just to read what she went through. Cannot imagine what it must have been like for her. She deserved so much better...God rest her soul.
What a fucking saint, that woman was.
Why didn‚Äôt charles just marry camilla in the first place?
"Also, this was a time when HIV was still fairly ""new"" in the epidemiological realm. People were scared they would die, the medicine wasnt accessible or viable, people didn't know how it was transmitted and it was feared that it would be like hepatitis or other contagious diseases. HIV is still stigmatized to this day, but it was completely outrageous in the 80s and 90s. To compare Princess Diana, someone who advocated for HIV understanding and treatment, to Nancy Reagan, who disbanded her ""friend,"" Rock Hudson, when he came to her for help in finding treatment, really puts into perspective what a public figure can do for the public. To close out, fuck the Reagans; scum of the earth and glad they're gone. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk!"
Why anyone looks up to the royal family confuses me.
That may be a little unfair to Harry. He seems to treat Meghan much better than how Charles treated Diana. Probably because Diana is his mother and was such a good influence on the boys before she passed.
Absolutely. They both are. Don't let the Murdoch media trick you into thinking William and Harry are at each other's throats.
Having been on the receiving end of being deliberately iced out and having useful/necessary information withheld for shits and giggles, it hurts. A lot.
The UK needs to abolish the monarchy.
She was already married and had a kid by that point. And even before that, she wasn't a virgin when she met Charles and therefore was not an option.
Also because she (Camilla) was divorced so she wasn't allowed to be in the family,especially since she had her own child outside of the Royal family. So they tried to get someone who could be a queen.. So they chose the People's Princess Diana.  After her death, when times have changed on the views of divorce, they allowed Charles and Camilla to marry. However, if Charles outlives the Queen, he will become King but Camilla will not be queen. The Queen does not want Camilla with any sort of power so that's presumably why she's keeping her crown for so long; currently the longest reigning Monarch. As much as Elizabeth didn't like Diana and is thought to be involved in her death, Elizabeth hates Camilla more. She would rather William become King VS Charles.
Hopefully she's not with Mother Theresa, because that lady is definitely in the Bad Place
">	God Save the Queen  God save our gracious Queen,  Long live our noble Queen,  God save the Queen  It‚Äôs literally in our national anthem, I liken it to the Americans kinship to the flag.   There are many amongst us who believe it‚Äôs an outdated system, a drain on the system, others see them as a tourism boost, a national identity and so forth."
"Is that still a requirement? Kate and Meghan seem like reasonably modern women, I can't imagine they were ""waiting"" on the offchance they would marry princes."
I continue to find these views on the monarch marrying a divorced person so odd...  They're literally the head of a church that came into existence to enable a monarch to divorce.
That‚Äôs interesting. Does the queen or royalty have any impact on things of importance? (Politics and the like)
They do a lot of charity work, like a lot. Another is that they create a lot of tourism but its a debatable how much they generate compared to anything. Really ingrained in our culture though, I feel an odd bit of loyality towards the Royals even though I have no connection to them.
Nope it's not! The expectations have changed. Meghan was even a divorcee.  After both her sons got divorced, the Queen allowed Diana's sons to marry for love in order to avoid a similar fate.
Not any more. No mention was made of it regarding Kate (there was an announcement for Diana, which is just gross), and Meghan was previously married. Not that long ago, the King had to abdicate because he married a divorc√©e. Things have loosened up somewhat, thank fuck.
Yes, but that was a man divorcing a woman. So that's *totally* different
"In theory, the Crown is a final ""no you can't do that crazy shit because I'm dissolving parliament"" in the system of checks and balances."
They allowed the kids to divorce?  That makes me really happy.
>the Queen allowed Diana's sons to marry for love  Fucked up that it had to come to that. No one should need permission to marry, especially to marry someone they actually genuinely love
If she ever exercised her supposed power it would amount to an abdication. I can imagine she'd do it in the case of a serious breach of her principle, however for the most part the Queen actively takes no part in politics.
Charles and Diana‚Äôs divorce was super messy.   It‚Äôs the only reason why the Queen relaxed her rules for her grandkids. Better to marry a commoner for love than to go through an embarrassing divorce. Being a royal is all about managing appearances, and getting a divorce means you can‚Äôt claim to be better than the masses (the underlying assumption being that marriage should be easy since royal couples don‚Äôt have to worry about any of the normal issues that cause divorce - money and kids draining money).
I think it also had a lot to do with the publics view of monarchy was not great after the treatment of Diana and a lot of people found the royal family too cold and aloof. Having William and Harry marry out of love does a lot to humanize the crown.
My office culture is like this. I‚Äôm not one of the ‚Äúcool kids‚Äù so I‚Äôm always left out. We are all in the same office and they will all get up and walk to a meeting as a group without me.
Something like this happened to me in high school. I came into my  English class late on the first day, the desks in the class were arranged in like groups there were four desks per group and there was like maybe eight groups in the class. Anyways I show up late and everything is taken, besides these three desks with this weird ass kid in one of them. I realized he was pretty chill he just had a hard time expressing himself to others without coming off strange. He was really into anime and he was the kid that would naruto run down the hallway. Anyways I didn‚Äôt know anything about anime but dragon ball z so we would talk about that and shit I would see him in the hallway and ask him how he was doing and all of that, then Christmas break rolls around we have a half day before we get let out for two weeks and he gives me this watch as a present and tells me thank you for being his friend. Also we were dirt poor so now that I think about it that was like the only thing I got for Christmas that year tbh. His name was Caleb and he was a good guy at heart. (:
For the past 9 months I‚Äôve been mocked and treated badly by my fellow co-workers at the office, it turned out that yesterday our company fired 80% of its employees, I‚Äôm the only one left in my department.
Long time ago, I worked at a place that had multiple shifts that overlapped. When I was hired, several people warned me about this creepy guy who worked the night shift. People joked that he was the most likely to go postal and kill us all one day.  When I finally met him, I really didn't know what to expect. He was an older dude who always wore cowboy boots and those old-fashioned gold-rimmed aviator-style glasses. He was a super awkward guy, but he seemed nice. I always got along with him.  When I left that job, we all went out for dinner and drinks, including him. And as is usual with a big drunken group, we ended up with not enough money to pay the bill at the end of the night (people leaving early and not leaving money for their share, people miscalculating what they owe ‚Äì you know). Nobody knew this though. Because this guy quietly covered the difference. I only found out weeks later.  Super nice guy. Just really really socially awkward.
Makes you wonder why everyone else is a dick to him.  Just a fucked up office culture or did he piss people off early in his time there and people can't get past it?
When i first started college there was a guy who suffered muscular dystrophy and everyone looked at him really weird and didnt talk to him. First team assigment we got i immediately told him to join us. Best decision ive ever made became my best friend and help through a lot. Unfortunately i always knew and he knew to that his condition would only get worse, and he always suffered from low self esteem and fear of dying you, everytime we drank and got wasted together he thanked me for being one of the few persons who treated him as an equal and not felt sorry for him. Sadly he past away from a brain tumor and malpractice of the hospital and i miss him everyday. Sorry for the long sad story, but please treat everyone as an equal it would change their lifes.
"I've befriended outcasts twice when I was in secondary     One of them was a girl who was just incredibly shy and had some ""immature"" interests (**really** into fairies and Disney). She turned out to be super nice and I felt really bad for her and I never understood why people wrote her off or actively ignored her.     The other one was this dude who tried to neg me (literally told me I would be super hot if I ""lost some weight and had bigger breasts""), was wildly misogynistic, treated other girls in my class like shit and made fun of the some boys in my class for being effeminate. I understood very quickly why people loathed him     I'd say go ahead and try to befriend people who seemed to get left out, but be aware that some people are left out for a reason"
When I was in college nobody could tolerate this one guy on my floor. It turned out later he was on the autism spectrum albeit highly functioning. He didn‚Äôt irritate me as much as he did other people and I didn‚Äôt mind keeping him company at group functions and other get-togethers. Well, he was very good at math and landed a stellar internship his summer before senior year. Well next summer they were looking for interns again - he was a year older and had been hired full time. The position would‚Äôve been great experience for me, but it was a highly competitive spot.  As it turned out, the guy on my floor raved about me and really pushed for them to hire me. He was the reason I started working there and what launched my career. It‚Äôs been ten years and I wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near where I am without his help. Sometimes it pays off to show a little patience and tolerance. It‚Äôs a lesson I try to remind myself of every now and again.
Was reading some of the comments and this is more common than I thought. :(
Five days later...  *Phone rings*  Oh, look it's that guy from...  *Hey, so, you should call in sick tomorrow.*  Ruh roh.
In an office where no one will talk to me either. Im shy and I don't really initiate conversations so when I first started I didn't really talk to anyone and no one talked to me. It's now 4 months in and this week I gave up on sitting in the break room at lunch and now go sit in my car, at least I don't have to listen to everyone else having conversations with their work friends now.  Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone. I'm trying to get over my anxiety and initiate convos, my voice comes out very weak though. The few times I've tried I've felt shut out of the convo very shortly after, kinda like lurking in a chat room but doesn't feel quite as nice.  I do try to make my cubicle inviting. I have some of my drawings up and Harry Potter stuff as well as a picture from my vacation. I have some nice peppermints in a dish for people to take when they walk by, it's popular. I also contribute to the break room, bringing in nicer tea bags and coffee than the company provides and sometimes I'll even buy a box of chips or cookies from Sam's and leave them there for people to eat.
Sometimes people are alone for a reason. Sometimes not. Nice to know that someone made a friend out there, that they needed.
I did this for a new guy on our job but then he left not long after. He was always the butt of everyone‚Äôs joke and I couldn‚Äôt stand it.
I am crying. :']
We need so much more empathy in this world. It's not too much to ask to treat others how you'd like to be treated.
"My work is like that too. My manager would go to lunch with a group of people almost every day. It was lunch time and he was gathering the crew. There was someone in my cube at the time talking about work related stuff. My manager invited the guy in my cube, but not me. He invited the contractor in the cube next to me, too. I asked him about it and he said ""Because you never go."" But I have gone with them once in a while. The other two people he invited have never gone with them. Not once. I just thought it was strange."
That sucks. I don‚Äôt understand why people continue to act like high schoolers long after high school is over.
In situations like this you just have to not care and do your own thing. Eventually they wonder why you don‚Äôt care about being in the group which makes you seem cool. Then they start inviting you places.   Or you know, just don‚Äôt give a crap in general and got on with your life.
Do they ever take your stapler?
That reminds me of the dollar my husband has in his wallet (we're European and live in Germany so we don't have dollars as currency). One time he was working in a kitchen and they had this Polish dude who was the dishwasher. His German wasn't very good and as he was the bottom of the kitchen hierarchy, he was generally treated like shit. My husband is a generally friendly person and thinks any social hierarchy is complete BS so he always made an effort to be friendly to the Polish dishwasher. So one day the Polish guy wanted to give my husband a little souvenir of their friendship when one of them was leaving. He didn't have anything as a gift but he had a dollar bill so he would remember him. My husband has forgotten this guy's name and lost touch a long time ago, but he still carries that dollar in his wallet to this day.
Is he storming Area 51 with us?
What ever happened? Lost touch?
We went to a fairly large school so after 10th grade we didn‚Äôt have any classes together, so I never saw him. Then we graduated and I stayed here in my town to learn trades while everyone went off to college. I did see him working at a local sandwich shop a few months ago and when we both saw each other we had big smiles on our faces and we did that whole small talk chat catching up thing, you know how it goes, but it was really busy so he couldn‚Äôt stay and talk. He seems to be doing okay. I could tell he matured a lot from that time but he still seems to be a weird kid and you know that‚Äôs all cool because weird is fucking awesome in 2019.
Oh damn
Were you the boss and this is your revenge?   Well played. Well played.   (Seriously though, is this a *good* thing for you? Or an ‚Äòoh crap, I now have *all* the work to do‚Äô)
.. Is it a good thing to be left with all the work?
Sounds like you work with one of my buddies haha. Its the dude you know will take a bullet for you no doubt, but he can be a little bit hard to be around...
Cowboy boots, gold-rimmed aviators, and socially awkward? Sounds like me in a few years.
I worked where a guy was shunned because he was not socially cool.   Our boss had a heart attack and died.  This guy tries t0 comfort by leaving a candy cane on everyone's desk and they mocked him behind his back.     Not much different than the assholes in high school.
We once had a guy who everyone was a dick to. So I went out of my way to be kind to him and treat him with respect and maybe make a new friend.  He suggested that I read Mein Kampf.  He was eventually fired for suggesting that one of our new female hires should have sex with a large dog. He was training her.  Sometimes, people shun someone for a damn good reason.
It‚Äôs probably because he was socially awkward and they all just over time hated him
Thank you for sharing your story. I can't imagine how difficult it is to have lost such a great friend but he's now remembered by one more person, a stranger on the Internet knows that he touched your life in a positive way. I hope that helps you a little, knowing that someone else got the experience a glimpse of how great of a person he was. I'm deeply sorry for your loss. You were a great friend to him and I'm sure he appreciated you even more than he actually let on.
I‚Äôve had that same experience before.   When you try your best to include someone but they give you every reason not to and you see them for who they are.   Then there are the genuinely good people who get left out.
This kinda got shoved down, but damn thats good. What job is it if you dont mind me asking?
I hope if I were in this situation I could say no, WE should call in sick and go have fun or get help or both.
Fuck that, sit in the break room at lunch and talk to them. Add to the conversation. Inject yourself. You can do it.
It's too common unfortunately. Our older installers were doing this to our younger installers for being inexperienced and we end up going through installers quickly.   Took one of the main guys aside and flat out told him how would he feel if I treated his daughter like that for not having 10 years of experience using excel spread sheets - He quit being a dick but unfortunately the new tech that was currently being bullied just couldn't handle it and resigned a couple weeks later.   Some people are actually just horrible human beings
The innate desire to be accepted.   Being able to see other people not being accepted is how you convince yourself that you are accepted.
Because H.S. is a micro-cosm of BS that doesn't teach you anything about how it is in the real world. It produces nothing useful and then everyone gets together every 10 years afterwards to pretend like that BS meant something.
"I dont care who tries to tell me I'm wrong, ""High School Never Ends"" is an accurate as fuck song."
I like the sentiment and you‚Äôre trying to help but ‚Äòyou just have to not care‚Äô is very hard for some people, it‚Äôs not as simple as telling yourself I don‚Äôt care anymore, you know. It‚Äôs kind of an involuntary response from your body/mind when something happens.
"One my greatest life lessons:  In high school I worked as a bus boy.  Busboys & Dishwashers are constantly messing with each other.  Me and this one dishwasher, had to be in his 20s, me in my late teens, were really good at messing with each ohter.  In a Guy vs Guy friendly way.  Guys get it, girls think we hated each other.  But really we were like best work buds.   Anyhow my birthday comes around.  The dishwashers have a tradition of spraying anyone who's birthday it is at the end of their shift.  I knew this.  He knew this.  I kept outsmarting him and avoiding the spray.  The headcook/co-owner is in the office and I walk by.  He pulls me in.  He's noticing me outsmarting the dishwasher and he knows the tradition.  He tells me:  > Look you're probably going to go to college. You're going to make way more money then this guy will ever see.  He's not the smartest guy but he works hard.  This spray people on their birthday thing is one of the few things in his life where he gets to ""win"".  So just pretend like your avoiding him but make sure he sprays you good.  Give this to him.  It really opened my punk eyes up.  It really just opened my eyes to how the world works and how some people just got shitty brains."
Damn. You just reminded me of the 5 pound note in my wallet, I'm American. A coworker went to the UK for vacation a few years back and I was one of the last people he saw to give a souvenir to. He ended up running out of stuff, but gave me that instead. About a year later, he was diagnosed with cancer and ended passing a few months afterwards.   I still have the note in my wallet and he gave me the greatest gift, a dad joke. I pull my wallet and say it's really heavy and pull the bill out saying it's 5 pounds.
Asking the important questions here.
I really want know.
Hi Gina Linetti
Now it‚Äôs just me and my boss. Although I was treated like an outcast I would‚Äôve rather not see everyone losing their jobs, they seemed like good people overall.
I think many of us would be surprised with just how little work 80% of a company's employees actually do.  \*gets back to reddit\*
*Yeah? Well, that badass just gave half his paycheck to orphans.  Orphans with diseases!*
People suck.
"as some guys who bowl for soup said- ""highschool never ends"""
Speaking of mocking...  > t0  Seriously?  Hey everyone, get a load of this guy; He's super c00l!
Or, alternatively, be ok with being on your own.   I try to (socially) avoid everyone I work with, and I am A-OK with it.
Groupthink overrides people being compassionate unfortunately.
I was bullied by my peers and an outcast in school,  I suffered from sudden panic attacks with no trigger where I cried hysterically thinking I was about to die. Years later I saw a really great therapist that told me the primal effects of this. She said when a person isn‚Äôt accepted by the group on the core level they feel fear and panic. We‚Äôre meant to be in pack and social and help one another survive. So basically not being accepted in the group makes a person think they will die.
And also to continue to judge their classmates ten years later about life choices. I‚Äôve gotten sick pleasure to know the girl that used to be the mean girl turned into a Karen McTwat selling MLM and cheating on her military husband.
I had an old lady customer I was friends with when I worked at goodwill, the very last day I worked there she gave me a silver dollar ‚Äújust in case you need money one day‚Äù. You bet your ass it stays in my wallet and I‚Äôm never spending that shit
Why use lot word
NINE NINE
That's how you can tell you're a good person.
If they were mocking you and treating you badly for no reason then they were absolutely *not* good people overall.
Jokes on us, the guy works IT and now has an 80% decrease in workload maintaining the network and systems.
Some People Suck
Often but not always
That even makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Kinda sad to think about it that way. Good thing we have some good ones out there.   Edit: Stop upvoting this. Weirding me out.  @@  2nd Edit: Now you're just doing it cause I told you not to.
That's actually a great piece for use if there is a societal collapse, as silver will be accepted as money even when there is no money.  True emergency money
When few words do trick
NOICE
This, respect yourself more please, don't pander to those assholes that will cast you aside without a second thought.
This post is a perfect example of your comment

I remember getting my first paycheck around 17 and driving my little bro around and getting food for us. Those were good times, I love you little bro
I‚Äôve come to a conclusion that wholesome memes work well with baby yoda and will always be guaranteed an upvote.
I remembered I was 19 when I first bought dinner for my fam my dad wanted to always get the check and I beat him to the punch. It was a great feeling.  EDIT: Whoa I didn‚Äôt even realize it was my cake day. Thanks all for the kind words.
My sister got her first car when she was 20 and I was 16. She let me drive her brand new car. I'll never forget remembering the sense of awe and thanks that she would allow me to do that.
When I moved out at 19 my sister was 11 I would go pick her up after work and give her and her friends rides n whatnot. Our favorite thing was to go to a 24/7 restaurant between my mom's house and my place on late Friday nights eating pie drinking coffee and talking about everything/anything. Id give anything for those days again

You‚Äôre a good brother
It feels so liberating. I remember buying like $50 of chinese food after my first paycheck over a decade ago cuz that's what we were feeling.

Nope we support him and get him the help he needs.
He‚Äôs posed perfectly to be on a dollar bill.
I see he also wrote an entire book for said picture. Dedication.
i trust this man from just this picture.
I like the lighting and the color is good as you can often wipe an older person out. He looks positively vibrant. I really like his suit and the overall coloring of the shot. He should be a model. Nice job on the photography, now it‚Äôs time to get Grandpa some headshots for his next gig lol.
He seems so excited to have the honor of getting clicked by his grandson/granddaughter. Cute!  Edit: I completely missed out the fact that it could've been a granddaughter. Fixed it!

OP‚Äôs Grandpa: *‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not lupus.‚Äù  Team of doctors: *‚ÄùWe agree with him 100%.‚Äù*
non-professional here, wouldn't the shadows be an issue?
I think its a granddaughter
he has my vote
And then implies that writing an entire medical work is part of getting dressed? My man is a hard worker. That's true love and dedication.
To be fair, it‚Äôs never lupus
I don't so much mind the shadows on the face, although I could have gone with a fill flash for them, but I really hate the shadow behind him. The ones on the face give him dimension, but the one behind him just looks bad. Maybe try a small softbox, op, or a slightly different angle.

"Last semester my physics prof was on a ""panel"" or whatever they call it for this and it ran like 20 minutes into our class so the dude was sitting out there with our whole class. They finally walked out said ""congrats, dr."" And this dude started crying. Whole class was happy for him. Was a feel good moment for sure"
I want to watch this. Is there a bleacher section?
This is a very nice way to take the anxiety away as quickly as possible!

I am a year removed from finishing my Ph.D. in English. The feeling described here is amazing, don't get me wrong, but nothing compares to the feeling of finally finishing my dissertation.  I still remember it so clearly. It was around 11pm on a Wednesday and I was in my office on campus. I had finally finished proofreading every single goddamn page, including the bibliography and appendix (final page count: 292). I saved the file in 3 separate locations and emailed the final draft to myself. No way I was gonna leave anything up to chance.  I then took the bus home and got off one stop early, right in front of a local dive bar. My girlfriend was entertaining out of town friends, and that was perfect because I didn't want to talk to anyone in that moment. I just wanted to drink alone and *breathe*. The bartender asked me how my day was and I told him I had just finished my dissertation. He gave me a free shot and the few people sitting around the bar congratulated me. After an hour or so, I stumbled home in complete peace.

A physics prof of mine told me they usually make a decision within a few minutes at most, and the remaining 20ish minutes are just them shooting the shit to make the candidate nervous
How long is a PhD defence presentation ? 
You could always be part of the committee!
"Most defenses that I know about are open to the public. You can just check with the local university for defense announcements, or contact the specific department that interests you. Some people might love having a stranger there, but probably not everyone.   Edit: I realize that every place has a different format. I tried to preface this with ""that I know about"". My experience is from the US at a public research university. "
As a non-American, I still don't really know what bleachers are.
I wonder if any of them were so nervous that they didnt even realize that they were just called Doctor
"Right? They did the whole ""leave the room while we discuss shit"" thing for my masters paper and presentation, but when they called me back in, it wasn't near as fun as this lol. Didn't help that I was nearly in tears haha. After 7 years straight, I was so happy to finally finish college with a masters, anxiety made me think they were gonna fail me. "
Does anybody actually fail their dissertation though? By the time you get to the point of presenting your work I'm sure it's been refined many times with your adviser. Failing at that point would just reflect poorly on the adviser and the department.
Good luck, future doctor!
Good luck!!! You can do it!!  I‚Äôm about to start a PhD in robotics in the fall. This got me so excited for that potential future date (in... 5-8 years...)
And then try to find a job lol.
If it helps, I've heard from other commentors and this guy in the post that a defense isn't scheduled unless there's a highly probable pass rate!
You'll do it, and you'll make the world a better place too :D
Congratulations!
Doctor!
Brought tears to my eyes reliving my dissertation completion experience through reading yours. 
Came here to do this, left leaving satisfied.
One of my best friends was called back in and was handed a legal pad with three pages of scribbled notes, one of the council said ‚ÄúWe have listed our concerns here, once addressed we can reconvene.‚Äù  It was 3 punctuation errors and 2 typos. Most of the notes were page, paragraph, line indicators written in really large handwriting. They let him fix them with a pen in 10 minutes.   ‚ÄúThey handed me that thing and my heart fell out my butt. I still can‚Äôt believe that wanker did that to me.‚Äù
I honestly find that a bit annoying. You've worked so hard, why would you play with someone's emotions like that? Just let them be happy, it's not always necessary to crack a joke.
Can someone explain what does 'need for no reforms' mean? Does it mean they don't have to redo their Phd work?
My PhD program actually stopped having these closed session final decision moments because of the occasional times when the student doesn‚Äôt pass. Super awkward to fly your whole family out to see your seminar and have them all waiting to party after the final decision only to find out you didn‚Äôt pass....  Side note: imo it‚Äôs a major failure of the committee if they allow a student to do a defense before they‚Äôre ready. But my department liked putting bandaids on symptoms instead of curing the disease ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
I finished my doctorate about a year ago and at least for me it wasn't that bad.  If your committee is good they won't let you defend without being pretty much certain you'll pass.  If anything they're usually arguing about which edits to make. And while hearing that you passed is nice, the absolute best feeling is when you finally submit your dissertation to the library for publishing.  At that moment you are finally free.  
Congrats on becoming a PhD! What in?
A lot.     I just sort of exhaled and let a bunch of anxiety and tension.     Know one my friends apparently just started laughing maniacally and couldn‚Äôt actually talk coherently for about 5 minutes.
I'd believe that lol. Not sure if they'd do that in this circumstance considering it was holding up a class but maybe
"Been told the same by some while helping one of those ceremony.  He told me ""we only wait for the show, we've spent an hour trying to corner him with weird knowledge we often don't expect them to know and they do. That alone should do it"".  Plus, the one I was attending had two overseas profs in the comitee. You do not spend that kind of money when you know the guy will fail."
What I've heard is that the student's advisor doesn't even allow his student to go to defend if the advisor isn't absolutely sure he will be successful. An unsuccessful defense looks horrible for the advisor, it's basically a done deal by the time you defend.
I know you just spent years working endlessly towards this massive paper...but we really want to fuck with you
Depends.  Shortest I've seen at a Master's level was about 20 minutes and the longest was almost 2 hours.  I'd imagine pHD defenses can stretch out pretty long.  That's years and years worth of dedicated research to present.
I was talking with a grad student in my physics lab one time, and he said \~four hours.   You are essentially a living research paper, and the committee is going to poke and prod you on everything.  Hell, when I did my undergrad thesis, I had someone rib me for using a particular type of current source over another. (YES I USED A DAMN BJT. THEY DONT CALL FETs Fucking Exploding Transitors FOR NOTHING!)
Do I have to be a PhD to be on the committee?
Can I be part of the committee if I know nothing? I can bring baked goods. Im working on cheese danish lately.
Cheap bench seating, usually for sports. Stuff like this https://phocab-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/httpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons33cBleachers_0640jpg.jpg
"It's just another name for ""stands"" as in at a sports arena. "
They might have looked around for someone else :P
"I had this exact thing happen where they opened the door and called me ""doctor."" My memory is that I was so exhausted that I no longer had the capacity to be nervous.  It was like ""I've done what I can do, and if this wasn't good enough, then I will never be good enough."""
"Same! Except my  committee told me that I ""passed"" and didn't need to re-defend my master thesis. However, they also gave me a list of additional items to complete, so I'm still not done. I'm making progress, so hopefully I'll be actually done in a few weeks!"
Man, my masters defense was the opposite.  I stumbled through the data part only to get lobbed softball questions from the one committee member completely out of the field.    I‚Äôm sure it was decided before hand that I was passing unless I took a shit on the floor, so I was probably toooo comfortable.  
*F√ºhrer   FTFY
holy shit, a PhD in robotics?  What does that involve?  Please tell me more.    Also, will you be a doctor to robots, or a mad doctor, with a robot army?
"There are plenty of jobs out there for Ph.Ds  Unfortunately none of them are going to be doing shit you set out to do, but when a company needs someone with a buttload of experience in a field slightly related to what you are an expert in, and you are willing to take a ""marketing"" role, then there is a position waiting for you!  On the bright side, it probably pays better. "
After most PhDs, you have a fuckton of connections and experience. Getting a job isn't as difficult as most people make it out to be. You have to be strategic and do your homework, sure, but you only have to succeed once. 
It takes a lot of time, prep, and dedication on the part of the committee. They're not going to want to show up unless it's pretty much in the bag.
Im not sure about that. I have a stem Ph D and I've only made the world a better place for me. 
Well you always left me satisfied and smiling
Oh god. I simultaneously love and hate that sense of humor. 
Because the joy of learning the result will make the slight discomfort you feel now meaningless. It will even make the moment more special when you think about it in the future. 
There are 3 or 4 outcomes. Pass, minor reforms (spelling, structure etc.), Major reforms (theory, practice etc.) or I guess fail.  A pass is no need for reforms
My PI told me that if your committee is allowing you to set a defense date, then they have complete confidence you will be fine.  If they don't believe in you, then they don't let you set one.
I was a masters student but my PhD student friends said the most nerve wracking exam was the qualifying exam going from masters ‚Äî> PhD program. 
Thanks! In music.
The understanding is probably that if you made it that far youre probably good enough im guessing. Phd is hard people wouldve failed out a long time before then. 
You are in the committee, but we do not grant you the rank of Doctor. 
Doctor who?
Yes, sometimes a letter in the mail that is hopefully addressed 'Dr.' right on the front to let you know.
Ribs grow back.
A PhD in robotics entails spending 5+ years trying to get a robot not to fall over. 
My cousin basically just moved to a small city and is one of only a few radiologists in the city. Made him a shit ton more money than working in some major city.   Edit: Hes probably not a PhD. I honestly had no idea there was a difference between MD and PhD
That depends what kind of Job you want, and what your PhD is in.  Doing a philosophy PhD isn't actually going to be all that useful for getting a non-academic job, and there are far, far more philosophy Post-Doc applicants than there are positions.  A friend of mine said she applied for a post-doctoral position and there were 200 applicants. All of them had a PhD by definition. 
If you make it to your defense, it's almost impossible to fail. Any PhD candidate that made it into that room is gonna walk out a doctor so long as they can make it through the presentation. It takes 4-6 years to get into that room. All the failing pressure happened during that time. 
Oh cool like Dr Dre?
Yeah in the follow up tweets, the guy in the screenshot kept repeating that no advisor worth their salt would allow a dissertation to make it to the defense if it wasn‚Äôt good enough to succeed. 
If someone fails their defence it's on the advisor, not the candidate.   There is no reason why a person should fail their defence, because they should never be put in a position to fail. If someone isn't ready, their work is poor, or their research is shoddy, or whatever, it's on the advisor and the committee the stop the process. We then either try to fix the problem, or if it's not something that we can fix in a year or two, we award the candidate a Masters degree (for free) and tell them to hit the road.  Same thing with failing comprehensive exams or qualifying exams. Any person with an undergraduate degree could pass either with enough time and dedication. If the candidate fails it's generally because they were given poor advice and direction. I've seen lots of people fail out of grad school on comps, and in only a few cases can I say that it was the candidates' fault.   
This is outrageous, it‚Äôs unfair!
Omg it's everywhere. 
How can I ben in the comittee and not be rank of Doctor? This never happened in the history of Doctors!
Those would still be bleachers 
WhooOOOOOOooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo  DooooooooooweeeeeeeoooooooooooWooooooooeeeeeooooooooooo
Doctor Whomst
No ze don‚Äôt 
Eight years of school! On the other hand these programs tend to be fully funded so theoretically you graduate debt free, which is more than most MDs can say.
Unless this is something I've literally never heard of as the son of a radiologist in med school myself, your cousin is an MD or DO, not a PhD.
"This is correct. The actual defense **should be** a formality. You present to your dissertation comittee - they have been working with you for YEARS at this point. You presented to them your idea, they accepted it, you did the work and checked in with them every so often. To fail at this point is rare, and when it happens it is heavily the result of a shit advisor (who should never let you defend if you aren't ready, aka your work is of the right quality and your paper is comprehensive).   When I was done defending my dissertation, I hung out in the hallway with my grad friend I had asked to take notes for me (protip - in case they ask you to change something during the talk, or point out an issue, have your friend take notes for you as you are fried at this point and unlikely to remember the details). When that doorknob turned 10 minutes later and my advisor said ""congratulations"", it was like the world became colorized again. Holy shit what an ordeal."
Take a seat, young Skywalker
Excellent. Everything is going exactly as planned. 
Archimedes! No! 
You can get a Ph.D. in radiology, for sure. You can do research, you can work with radiology equipment (which can be complicated enough to basically require a physics Ph.D.). IDK if a lot of radiology Ph.D.'s also go to med school, but he didn't specify that his cousin didn't have an MD as well.
Why am I picturing someone standing guard over a stack of papers with one of those giant American gladiator q-tips, smacking away all the profs trying to get at it
You can enter a Ph.D. program with or without a Master's degree, and my guess is if you get to that point where they're kicking you out and already have one, well now you have two.
How can one be on the committee and not be a doctor its outrageous 
r/prequelmemes is leaking out again.. The plumber bill for this subreddit is going to be outrageous.
It‚Äôs treason then. 
Because you're fun.
Yes. You typically give a presentation (30 minutes to 1 hour) about your work.   You‚Äôll then take questions about the work from any non-committee members (the public). The committee members might also ask a few questions.  Most of these are very short, maybe 15 minutes, and it‚Äôs usually a friend asking about something you previously talked about.   Then the public leaves and the committee asks harder questions about your work. They may be asking for clarity or to gauge your understanding. You will have also previously submitted your written dissertation and they will bring up any corrections they want to see. The committee may then move to more general questions about your field and high-level questions about the impact of your work.   You then leave. The committee does something for way too long. They then call you back in and tell you that you passed. 
I mean that‚Äôs a pretty valid argument in this case.
*Waves hand* republic credits will do fine
it‚Äôs treason, then
this is blasphemy, this is is madness!
You made me watch all 8 Harry Potter movies. I don‚Äôt even like Harry Potter!  Nonsense! You‚Äôve seen all 8 films!

I know someone who brought their daughter to the American doll store. The mother tried to get her daughter to pick a doll that looked like the little girl but she kept insisting on another doll. Their nanny later told the mother that the little girl picked the doll she picked because it looked like her mother.
It's the classic Abilene Paradox by Harvey. Everyone does something even though they hate it because they think the other person likes it. (maybe they didn't hate Wall-e but still, the concept is there).

Not to mention Wall-E is a really good movie. Easily in my top 10 animated films :')
We really don‚Äôt deserve kids.
She's so sweet! Wall-e is one of the best movies to be forced to see again btw, it went pretty well.

Was the doll named Anabelle?
My 6yo daughter is really into Star Wars. I asked her how come she likes it so much, is it because boys in her class like it? She said, ‚ÄúNo, daddy. It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs your favorite movie‚Äù  The funny part? I was never into it, and I never even watched any films (not even the old ones). We just saw the original one a few months ago together. I will never tell her I like Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek more.
kid: do you like wall-e?  babysitter thinking: I better say yes because she probably likes it and that's why she's asking me.  babysitter: yes, do you as well?  kid thinking: I better say yes as well because she already said she liked it and I don't want her to be sad.  kid: yes, let's watch it! <starts the movie>  <movie ends>  kid: did you like it? do you want to see it again?  babysitter thinking: I better say yes, i think it's her favorite movie and she wants to see it again.  babysitter: yes that sounds like fun  kid thinking: this woman is crazy, we just watched it and now she wants to see it again.  kid: ok! <starts movie>  <movie ends>  kid: you really like wall-e too right?  babysitter: yes it's such a good movie.  kid: so what do we do now? you want to see wall-e AGAIN? haha  babysitter: um yeah ok sounds like fun.

How was that commented 3 hours ago and your the first person to reply back?
Nah, dolls name was Albert Einstein
my dad once told he he used to really like salt water taffy (or someone did since my dad said it wasnt him) when i was like 14 and so i tried it and liked it, and i always liked it a little extra because it reminded me if my dad. offered him some and he was like no thanks not really into it.
*I better laugh at this comment, it seems like it took a lot of effort to write.*  Haha! Good one.
I get not wanting kids. But the hate kids get is pretty silly from some of those people, they act as if they weren‚Äôt children once themselves.  Never judge anyone who is at least trying to parent, it‚Äôs not an easy job.
OK  I've fallen in a pit

My wife is my favourite ex-girlfriend.
Maybe she is not the hottest wife he has ever had?
Reminds me of that video of the guy coming out of anesthesia hitting on his wife:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x9lPk1pZzI 
A friend of mine had a horrible accident that put him in a coma. After two weeks he woke up with amnesia. He remembered his parents but not his wife. When she stepped out he asked his dad ‚Äúwho is that hot girl that just left?‚Äù When he found out it was his wife he didn‚Äôt believe them because he thought she was way out of his league.   This was years ago, he‚Äôs better and they are still together.   Edit: He wrote an article about it (not the personal experiences part) you can read it here: https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a6596/warner-head-injury-schumacher/
At least you now know that your husband loves you from bottom of his heart
Or the husband thought it was his girlfriend and then covered it up really well.... 
The bad news is he forgets he has a wife when he's drunk
Being drunk is one of the weirdest things people can ever do
To be fair, she is pretty hot. 
Haha this is my fiance's favorite joke these days! He likes to tell people that I'm his ex girlfriend and it always gets a good laugh.   We get married in 3 months! 
He had a hotter wife from an arranged marriage, they skipped right past the girlfriend stage 
It‚Äôs time to play  MEET YOUR SECOND WIFE!
"""turn around for a moment"" hahahaha this guy"
This is amazing. Thanks you for this!!
Haha, well now she knows how he really feels awh
I instantly thought of this video. classic.
Did he get any memories back or did he have to start over from scratch? 
From the bottom of the bottle, at the very least 
Why you gotta twist something so wholesome into a side chick joke üòî
Or he was referring to his side chick and forgot he was with his wife lol
I have a really loving relationship with my husband and I think a large part of it is that I treat him with as much magic as he treats me. Fellas need to feel handsome and special, too.
...Someones never tried drugs. 
Can totally tell from the 10 pixes and extreme angle. 
Congrats!! :)

And the ‚Äúno!‚Äù afterwards. Omg they are so married 
How is this possible though? Sure there is some level of disorientation from waking up from anything but is it normal to experience this sort of straight up amnesia coming out of anesthesia?
or she IS just smokin.   I wanna see too
He did! He had to remember how to do a lot of stuff over though. Wasn‚Äôt easy but he‚Äôs doing well now. I edited my post with a link to an article he wrote about it. 
yes I  need to know this
>Lutya  This was on the front page like 2 days ago and it was not by u/Lutya.  Looking at Lutya's post history, user seems like a compulsive liar.
Sounds like he loves her from the bottom of his shaft too
Where do I find someone to treat like magic?
Technically alcohol is a drug
woohoo congrats (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)
[Such a good show.](https://youtu.be/fT7IDdP72GA)
Married people wouldn't display their beauty from behind?
Never been under or seen someone come out of anaesthesia before huh?  Being disoriented and having low inhibitions leading to hitting on people are both completely normal. He probably has no awareness of anything beyond what is directly in front of him.
Anesthesia doesn‚Äôt wear off immediately, and when you first wake up you‚Äôre pretty far out of it for a while in terms of being able to process what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs kind of like being drunk in terms of how you taper off. When I came off of anesthesia after oral surgery, I didn‚Äôt recognize the best friend I had taking me back home and thought he was kidnapping me at first (mind you, I didn‚Äôt make a scene or anything hysterical bc physically I just couldn‚Äôt, it was more like ‚Äúwho the fuck are you and why are you putting me in your truck?‚Äù) I also barely knew where anything in my apartment was 10 minutes later once I got home. It‚Äôs kind of a fun feeling, but you just don‚Äôt really process anything because your brain still thinks you‚Äôre asleep. 
Depends on how much of anesthesia you‚Äôre given is my guess. When I came out of that shit I was bleeding from my mouth like it was a waterfall and didn‚Äôt feel thing until I looked down and I didn‚Äôt know who anyone was for a little bit. 
I DEMAND ANSWERS
I wish I could tell you the directions to some secret fountain that spurts out life partners, but honestly, I feel I just got lucky. I think a lot of people dont realize how much work and compromise goes into a marriage. Both of us were just happy to compromise with each other when we started dating and it's our glue. 
So is paracetamol.   So is caffeine.     But colloquially when someone says drugs they are talking about illegal recreational drugs.

I may be straight, but if it were not for gay men, id have zero self esteem at all. If I got hit on by girls like I do gay dudes, id be married at this point. Maybe multiple times.

This seems like a great place to share this story:  My wife and I were in Yellowstone NP hiking the my Washburn trail. We were on our way down from the watchtower and crossing the lower peak when this man in another group walking by us says, and I quote ‚Äúthese mountains are majestic, but not as majestic as your beard.‚Äù  I had been growing beard for the good part of a year and that compliment from that stranger was the best thing I had heard, really put a spring in my step.  Thank you random gay man (it was obvious) for that impromptu compliment and the boost to my confidence 
I, a hetero woman, have only been hit on by another woman a few times but it was always a super unexpected flattering surprise. I never felt unsafe or like they were going to harm me if I said no but it was always a big suprise because I struggle to think of myself as attractive to anyone.
Kinda how I had my gay experience. I'd split up with an ex of 4 years, and was in a very dark place, my self-esteem was at an all-time low and I just felt disgusting. Went out one night and got hit on by a guy, didn't realise for like 30 mins tho. Made me feel really good about myself. Ended up going back to his and doing it. I prefer women still, but it was definitely not the worst way to end a night out, and it helped bring me back up! 
Love Mark Normand
This reminds me of a story...   My wife and I were on our honeymoon at Universal Studios and we stopped at a bar right inside the park right when we got there so we could grab a drink. There were two middle aged guys in the bar and you could tell they had already had a few drinks, but they were good drunks (super friendly and in a great mood). Every time they took a swig one of them would look over at us and yell ‚Äútake your shirt off!‚Äù which I thought was hilarious because my wife was kinda embarrassed (it wasn‚Äôt weird or creepy at all, even though that‚Äôs how it sounds. You could tell the guys were completely harmless and just goofing off) Next thing we know the bartender brings a drink over and places it in front of ME, saying it‚Äôs from that couple of guys over there. The whole time we thought they had been hollering at my wife but really they were talking to me. We ended up going over to sit right next to them at the bar and chatting for awhile while they bought us both drinks. It totally made my day though because I was super flattered and my wife couldn‚Äôt stop laughing about it as we walked out. 
As a straight guy, I thoroughly enjoy getting hit on by gay guys. Even though there's not much I can do with it, it sure is a nice confidence booster.
"Remind me of a gay too who tried to date me. I am straight but hey, to be honest this guy is realle handsome. It was in the university, and the girls in the class were talking about him and I could hear them say ""Wow he is so hot, I'd date this guy so much*. And I was like, yea, ok...  But he talked to me, and was saying that I was the most interesting and cutest guy in the class.  Like you know, this is kind of a relief, I have that insecurity with me everyday, where I barely talk to a girl. And he comes up and say, ""Man, with all honesty you're far being ugly, I really wonder how you don't have a girlfriend, I would totally do you.""  I replied ""You know, insecurities, confidence...""  Somehow we are friends. And he knows I am not interested. But the guy is really brilliant and pretty handsome.  EDIT fixed some mistakes. Thanks guys."
What do you do with reddit Premium
I mean... you can exchange currencies...
"So much this. I remember being asked if it bothered me when gay guys hit on me(am straight). I said""no it means I'm still attractive,it'll bother me when they stop hitting on me""."
This is probably gonna get downvoted but it's more like getting a ~~onion ring~~ curly fry in your straight fries because straight fries are... straight. Both are good nonetheless. 
Just recalling in my life maybe 5x a girl has actually come on to me. At least 20 guys have come on to me...i think it has to do with guys being more direct
I have zero self esteem. Will it increase if a few gay guys hit on me? 
We were in a gay bar after a Cubs game and the guy on the other side of me leaned in and said, Does your husband ever switch teams? Because he‚Äôs cute.   My husband does not, but he was totally flattered. 
Homophobia is a shit thing. I am glad there are people like you in the world.

"I had a coworker whose son is in and out of jail .. knocked up 3 diffrent girls and still need her full financial support at 30 ... and she said to me with with a smile ...

If I ever have kids and they think that they would have to 'come out' to me, I would see that as a major failure on my part.  It should be such that either I know about it for a very long time beforehand and/or the first time I know is when they're introducing their significant other to me, regardless of gender.
He would have to be pretty darn unattractive for me to not be into him, because I love his sense of humor.  - One of the few girls that is subscribed  Edit: I tried to Google what he looks like.

He might've actually been complimenting your wife.
Hey to be fair as a straight man i know a glorious beards when I see one, I just can't grow one myself.  Edit: typo made me look like I'm into hairy men

For anyone who cares these are from Mark Normans stand up.    If you think this is funny you should see him say it!
I had a sociology class where getting hit on by gay guys came up in conversation. Being deep in the south there was a lot of macho posturing about how most the guys there would punch the guy out or something. I was just sitting there thinking about how it would make my whole week to be hit on by a dude
If this was recent I'm going to be disappointed if you didn't discover you were gay and you two are happily married with a dog or he didn't become the best wingman ever. 
It works just like airpods, it's shows how rich you are
Shhhhh... don't tell him it'll ruin the joke.
Here I thought that having a gay son was like having a straight son that happened to be attracted to men.

"My dad said the same thing to my mom. Then my brother came out a few Christmases ago. My dad just sent a text to my brother saying ""come out to the garage and bring your favorite beer.""  They talked for hours that night. And because of their continued conversations and my mom's helping hand, my dad has become a much different person.  Sometimes people might say something, but when it comes down to it, they realize that their priorities aren't really where they thought they were."
"Whenever I talk to my kids about relationships, sex etc I always include the possibility of homosexuality in the discussion. For example I might talk to my son about ""the day you get a girlfriend or boyfriend"". I really hope and believe that on the day he will introduce a partner, the gender of that partner won't be an issue. So I agree, there shouldn't need to be a ""coming out"" part to this."
It‚Äôs not so much about you as the bringing up a topic that is important to them. Honestly though sometimes it‚Äôs not that obvious. 
Don't think of yourself like that; sometimes it's hard to bring it up, regardless of how sure you're about the person being supportive about it. Not everyone knows from a young age, sometimes, you have to come out *t**o yourself* before you can come out to other people.   And remember, you are not the only person in the world, you can be THE single best parent, and your child is going to have some insecurities because we are all humans.   In short, coming out to you doesn't mean you're a bad parent. And it doesn't have to be a traumatic deal, full of fear. 
"Tbh she was always fairly liberal in her beliefs when we met. After a few years she made some new friends that i really didnt like and she started sharing loads of alt-right stuff on facebook and believing everything she read on there  even if i fact checked it and said it wasnt real. She slowly became more and more far right in her beliefs and started hating everyone. She became racist and homophobic to the point of going on massive rants whenever she saw a ""foreigner."" This isnt why we split, she ran off to another country for a few months to have an affair and divorced me when she came back and managed to win custody as her (rich) parents funded her lawyers to the point where i was financially unable to fight anymore. I still have my daughter for 3 days a week though. Facebook, social media and newpapers like the Daily Mail (or any rupert murdoch news with its scare tactics) changed her views on the world, same as my once-hippie parents. It was pretty horrible to see but im glad to be free of her.  Just to add: This isnt to bash on anyone with right leaning beliefs, everyone is entitled to their belifs. This is a case of essentially extremism.  Edit: spelling"

Oh shit
I figured someone was going to say that as I typed the word ‚Äúbeard‚Äù.  He wouldn‚Äôt have been wrong in that context either
You know what else is hot? Other dudes. And women. Everyone is fucking hot I love it. 
I feel like most gay men don‚Äôt ‚Äúact gay‚Äù like the flamboyant stereotype you see in media.   They probably fly under the radar.  
I mean a good and funny friend is a very nice happy ending as well. Friends are awesome.
Hi there cutie, can I interest you in a multi level marketing scam?

Good thing he added the beer part otherwise I didn‚Äôt know which way this was going to go
"That's really heartwarming :)  I've grown up with my mildly homophobic Scottish family, and when I came out, everyone was just like, oh okay cool lol. One time on a drive back from a day out, I was resting my head in my bf's lap in the back seat, my dad saw us in the rear view mirror, smiled at my bf and carried on driving and smiling :)  A lot of the time people are ""homophobic"" due to their surroundings, not really their beliefs :)"
Honestly, being bisexual must be so fucking cool. Too bad other dudes have me way too fixated to ever bother experimenting with women, lol.

This breaks my heart. I have a 3 year old and I fear that this will be reality for her and her classmates because it doesn‚Äôt seem like anything is being done to prevent school shootings.
Similar thing also happened in Pakistan back 6 January 2014, when a 15 year old Aitzaz Hasan died while preventing a suicide bomber from entering his school of 2000 pupils.  It was reported that he was made to stand outside the school as a punishment for not being on time, when he saw a man with a detonator jacket entering the school. He confronted the man who then detonated his vest.  Aitzaz reportedly died on the scene and was posthumously rewarded the Sitara-e-Shujaat, a Civilian award.  Aitzaz Hasan(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitzaz_Hasan)  Thanks for the gold Sir! Much appreciated for highlighting this comment.
Instant goosebumps üò≠
Being a former student at stem this whole thing has really hit close to home, but this just warms my heart. Spartan strong!
That shows the deep love and respect that his fellow classmates and friends have for him. So very touching.
Last year a 17 year old girl was fatally wounded in a car accident not far from my house. Today her parents received a diploma in her name. She was a beloved member of our community and her being gone has left an unfillable hole in our hearts
Wholesome? the fact that a minor had to rush a shooter and tackle him is not wholesome. I‚Äôm happy they remembered him, but this is neither wholesome nor a meme; it‚Äôs just fucked up :(
So sad. Our country needs to do something to prevent these tragedies from occurring   Edit: Wtf did I just start
Honestly i don‚Äôt feel like this is wholesome, it‚Äôs sadder and more terrifying than anything. I mean, yeah, cool on the classmates to remember him but he‚Äôs dead.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just no way to stop all these mass shootings,‚Äù says only country where mass shootings happen regularly.
So fucking sad wtf I never heard about this...
Once Buddha was walking from town to town with his followers. This was in the initial days. They happened to pass a lake and Buddha told one of his disciples, I am thirsty. Get me some water from that lake.  The disciple walked up to the lake and noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and he also saw a bullock cart crossing through the lake. As a result, the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple returned to tell Buddha The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.  After about half an hour, again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him the water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.  Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be and the mud settled down on its own and you got clear water. Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen effortlessly.  Buddha says having peace of mind is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you, that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment.
A kid brought a pistol into my high school.  The principal put it in her desk drawer until the end of the day and told him to leave it at home from then on.  He did.
I'm a former student as well. I was driving home from college and saw the parade of marked and unmarked police cars. I'll never forget that. This is something really cool that they've done. Spartan strong!
Something other than praying.  People are fucking *dying*
Not exactly wholesome either.  Sure it was a great gesture for someone that lost their life trying to save others. But that doesn't make it any less grim
Yeah, this made me super sad. He should still be alive... Something big needs to change for these terrible shootings to stop happening
That‚Äôs the most disheartening part. There ARE ways to stop it, but god forbid losing voters and lobbying money.   I was Australia for a few weeks a few years back. In the first week I was there, there were two mass shootings. My friends were just shocked as to how that even happens and why it‚Äôs so frequent.
Gee I wonder why
I needed this
When did you graduate though
Please stop doing this. People keep taking the easy way out on these issues, using a strawman to push their opinions. The reality is this is more complicated than just hunters wanting their guns or self-defense, and it doesn't do it justice to simplify the issue and blow off more difficult questions.  Edit: Also, before it begins, the downvote isn't a disagree button. If you think I'm wrong please say so, otherwise I have NO idea what people are taking issue with. Downvotes should be for off topic or hateful comments, not something you personally don't agree with.
Life is so precious and to just have it thrown away by some person who you don't even know and for no reason... At least he died being a good person and saved others
Welcome to /r/wholesomememes, where seemingly 80% of the content of this sub should belong in /r/thesilverliningmemes.  And no that's not a real sub before you click on it.
Start treating mental illness, become tolerant, dismantle the war on drugs, stop worshipping guns as mystical objects.
"> god forbid losing voters  I agree with most of this but I believe that it is a representative's responsibility to represent the people. Thus losing voters in your area means you've failed as a representative of the people because you no longer represent the will of the people.  The problem here is that the will of many is ""give me my guns and my money and fuck off"" and they are against any action to control shootings. The legislators representing these people may have the same beliefs but if we can change the will of the people we can change the will of the government. Or at least, that's the theory of democracy.  If that's untrue we have a bigger issue at hand.  Edit: lobbying money is complete bullshit, tho, I'll totally agree with that."
Mid-noughties.
And we can‚Äôt even talk about guns because ‚Äúdon‚Äôt politicize a tragedy‚Äù üôÑ
Stop giving shooters so much recognition as well. Part of it has to be the amount of infamy the shooter receives. We need to stop giving shooters attention. Don‚Äôt mention their names on the news, don‚Äôt show the public their picture etc. shun them basically.
‚ÄúThank you for an amazing meal and wonderful company. That‚Äôll be $450.‚Äù
Anyone else get thrown off by ‚Äúhe starts to open up a but‚Äù   I thought it was going to take a turn. 
I used to be a stripper and I had this one regular that I got very close with. Really great guy, he‚Äôs a desert storm veteran and now has a very good job, great family, and is still built like a brick shit house lol. We never did anything dirty, we‚Äôd just sit together when it was slow and drink and cuddle and talk about our lives. Once in a blue moon he‚Äôd take me for a lap dance, and even then we‚Äôd usually just cuddle and talk but I was naked now lol. This one time after we had been drinking a lot he took me for a dance and started to open up about some very private stuff related to when he served. And suddenly this huge tough guy breaks down right in front of me and just falls apart. I just hugged him and listened, telling him it‚Äôs all okay now, though from what he talked about and the haunted look in his eyes it definitely wasn‚Äôt for him. Eventually I managed to snap him out of this bad headspace and hung out with him the rest of the night, making sure to tell him often that he‚Äôs loved and everything is okay now.   We still talk and even though we have a big age difference he‚Äôs one of my closest friends ‚ù§Ô∏è  The look in his eyes in that moment though is something I‚Äôll never forget.   EDIT: thanks for the silver and gold you guys!! 
*happiness noise*
Plot twist, they get married
Who's cutting onions
Another damn fine reason to destigmatize the sex/companionship industry.  I seriously cannot see why this shouldn't be a service available for those who are grieving.  Good on this lady if the story is real. 
Touching story.   
can someone link to the original post 
Cheaper than a Michelin Star restaurant!
Anywhere else in the world that would be closer to $60-100 including various parts of Europe and Canada 
Thank God it wasn't just me. 
I came here exactly for this
"> a but  Not his butt, or her butt. But ""a"" butt. Who's butt is it? Where'd it come from? What was it made of? How'd he open it? I need answers"
Well done.  Former fetish worker and I've also had quite a few regulars open up.  It's really shocking what society asks men to hide.  I'm glad you could be there for him.
Us humans are weird creatures, with these complicated blurry lines between intimacy, sexuality, and money. 
You're a good person. Thank you.
Yes, we would love to join and let him know we love his cooking and his wife was a lucky woman
I'll even do it for 20% less than that prostitute. 
No :( Only sad 
A dead wife and having to pay money to someone so you can relieve some grief because you have no one else to turn to is a happy topic to you?
The banter between these two  ‚ÄúI miss my wife, the way she used to cuddle me in the morning and stroke my hair‚Äù   SW: ‚ÄúI know a guy who will give us a thousand dollars for a threesome but you have to suck his cock, also get tested I let a dude go bareback last week for double‚Äù   ‚ÄúI REALLY miss my wife‚Äù
Plot twist, his wife died by poisoned food.
This makes me so sad. I wanna give this guy a big hug. 
Companionship and connection during times of grief used to be a major function of religious groups. A lot of people no longer subscribe to religion and that‚Äôs fine, but we haven‚Äôt really replaced the tangible community aspects of it  *edited for clarity
Surprising lack of Touching story.

Getting paid $450 makes it cheaper than a gas station corndog.

I went to a gig last night to see a punk rock band that have been around since the 70s. As you can imagine, most of the crowd was age 50+ rockers. The frontman of the band spoke a lot about a former band member that passed away on Monday and about Keith Flint and told everyone there that if they are struggling with anything, there is always help and said something like 'I don't care how fucking emasculating you think it is, it's OK to talk about what's bothering you. Don't become another statistic' and everyone let out an almighty cheer. It really made me think and I had a good chat about things that were bothering me with my wife in the car on the way home.  I slept really well last night. Could've been the beer, or the 2 hours of dancing around but I know one thing, my mind felt clearer when I went to bed. 
"When people need intimacy, but cannot find it ""the way they are supposed to,"" they will find other ways to get that connection that still matches the perceived ""proper"" way to seek it out, cost irrelevant.  There is a reason exes are hard to move on from, intimacy is addicting. We are just lucky that its also usually good for us. "
Getting paid to eat a home cooked meal? I'd do it for gas money. Hell, I'll throw in a high five for free.
Honestly this is probably the worst part of being an atheist for me. Growing up I went to church a ton with my family even though neither of my parents believe anymore and the sense of community you can get from a church is nothing like I have seen in recent memory. It's one of the parts I actually like about religion and I am a very (albeit not outspoken) anti religion guy. 
Does it?
Lol! An itchy dick- it‚Äôs true tho, don‚Äôt spend 60 dollars for a hooker. 
I care
The price of the gas station corn dog cannot be measured in gold, but only in time taken from the end of your live
Yes, not even cheap restaurants pay you to eat there. 
good bot
Or the time spent on the toilet. It adds up man..
This is an untapped market people.
Thank you, kind human being
You can pay the gold price, the iron price, or the porcelain price.
But she was not an untapped market...
My heeeeeeaaaaaaart
The people who do jobs like this are really underapreciated. This warms my heart.
This is sweet and all, but the part about it being the dude's birthday is something that's been added on very recently and isn't true. The situation is heartwarming enough on its own, it doesn't need the add-ons.
A pleasant reminder of how pure and wholesome our world can be. :)
Im not crying u are crying
The best looking human being I've ever seen was a sanitation worker. I was driving behind the truck when I saw him and I was stunned by how amazingly good looking he was. I couldn't stop staring. I've never seen him since, so maybe he got discovered by some modeling agency. But I wanted to grab on the back of that truck and ride it wherever he was going.
At first I thought it was one of those posts that starts with something wholesome but end with a bad ending but then it wasn‚Äôt so I took MATTERS INTO MY OWN HANDS
My dad is a trash man so this means a lot. Teach children to respect those in jobs that may be deemed less desirable.
Mine too...  I'm melting into a puddle but everything is okay because I saw this post first.  Edit: I think this might be my first comment to get over a thousand karma.  This is mildly surprising.  Thanks, y'all.
My eyeeeeees... totally just allergies tho
I used to work in a house in cul-de-sac on an estate (in southern England); and the next door neighbour would have a full English ready for the dustmen each week as they came round and they'd all stop and sit in her front garden swigging tea and eating eggs and bacon.   Also heard that a lot of bin men get great tips for Christmas in the UK, but that might just be in my area.   They're all normally nice cheerful guys so it's good to see them getting some love from their community.  EDIT: To all the non-English folk not familiar with the term 'dustman', please enjoy this song: https://youtu.be/Y7GeZ3YmONw  About as English as anything can get. Also maybe explains the thinking that bin men don't earn a lot.
This! Let it be wholesome without tacking on clear lies
Why does someone have to do that? If that's true and it's not his birthday, I want to know who sits there and creates this thinking that adding a lie to it somehow makes it better. It's probably someone's aunt. I guess the intentions behind doing it aren't bad though...
I wish my whole life was a pleasant reminder.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna take that man by the garbage can and riiiiide (him) till I can‚Äôt no more....‚Äù

Sounds like you could use a muffin!
U speak such a whimsical language
Not just the birthday lie, then also add the lie that its the only gift he got
I could almost always use a muffin.
reading that comment was like eating marshmellows with my eyes, help me please oh my god i can't open them
Yeah the fact she made the muffin is already super wholesome. Reading all the extra stuff made me skeptical this was even real.
I don‚Äôt know how, but if I could, I would make you a muffin
Why thank you.  I appreciate your hypothetical muffin very much.
It's awesome that this is happening, but having to rely on gifts from strangers for healthcare needs sounds incredibly harsh. There has to be a better way to do this.
There are so many good people in the world, sometimes I forget but I'm glad I read this today. Thanks for sharing OP
Had a random redditor gift zoo tickets for my daughter and me a couple years back when I was between jobs and made a post joking about taking her to petsmart to look at animals.  It was super kind and unexpected, and gave me an opportunity to do something fun with my kid.  I wont forget it.
That is very wholesome, but just for my own clarification : how expensive is a medical bed? They bought a house for him, but he still will be sleeping on the floor? 
[Link to the original comment. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9k732a/comment/e6xjfqf?st=JMPXETXA&sh=12d4f46c) Warning: someone may or may not be cutting onions over there.
Yeah, it's kind of the opposite of Facebook. People actually helping each other! 
We did it Reddit!
Lol I remember this post in ask reddit, something like : What is one of the most unfair things you‚Äôve seen
That's my reaction to most things on this sub. It's great that people help, but their needs arise from being put in an unnecessary and impossible situation to begin with.
"It's another one of those ""Elderly man has to look for food in trash cans or starve. Community donates a headlamp for them. YAY! Problem solved!"" stories. It's a good thing that these random people helped that dude, nothing wrong with that part, but the mere fact that their well-being depends on the charity of random people because of the way healthcare is setup in USA is just sad."
Always look for the helpers :) 
Omg don‚Äôt make me cry 
Currently renting, the poster + siblings are all working towards getting the house.
Also, why are the options 1) sleep in $200k bed, or 2) sleep on the floor. Surely get him a standard bed?
Sorry hun, needs to be memory foam. NEXT!
Yea, turned out to be a lot sadder then expected, I though I would be furious by the end of it, but a lot of it was just cancer and death
The vast majority of top posts on r/upliftingnews are of the same ilk. Depressing as fuck news stories about people raising a bunch of money to fund cancer treatment and such. The system is broken.
Especially because the only reason they got this help is because they‚Äôre well-off enough to have exposure to and knowledge of how to use the internet. What about the many families in the same situation but are disenfranchised in such a way that they don‚Äôt have internet access?
Thanks Mr. Rogers! :)
Rogers : Be kind to your fellow man.  Irwin : Be kind to nature and animals.  Ross : Be kind to yourself.

gotcha, u/AIDSinyourbutt
Some people with back problems find normal beds uncomfortable. He might have a bed/couch,  but chooses to sleep on the floor/chair due to it. 
Hold on.  $200,000?? 
Needs to seat 20 dads. NEXT!
"Yea upliftingnews does the opposite. ""One person gets lucky break in a tough situation that millions of other people are still in"" doesn't uplift me "
Yeah, but guns are priced for public consumers. Healthcare is priced for insurance companies.

I am having severe back pain due to trauma and any mattress and or bed just makes it worse in the morning. I have to reheat my pillow multiple times a night to keep it somewhat bearable. Sometimes sleeping in a sitting position is easier and less painful and I have heard people with similar issues saying their doctors told them to try sleeping on a blanket on the floor, back upwards, so your spine rests on your body and keeps the proper shape 
Sometimes $500 is a lot for people, especially if you‚Äôre dealing with a lot of medical bills and feeding five adults. Most people don‚Äôt have anywhere near that in their bank account and are barely surviving living paycheck to paycheck
This is America.
'Woman gifted ¬£1k finally has the last moneys needed to adopt kid after saving up for years working two jobs'  Like, was the kid in cryo-stasis? That's years of love and support lost when you've a loving mother and a desperate child made for each other. That's the one that broke me.
Is that why you're always angry?
I can be a rich man with that money in my country. Damn..
I could *buy a house* for that. What the fuck.    ^^^^I ^^^^mean, ^^^^not ^^^^a ^^^^very ^^^^nice ^^^^one, ^^^^but ^^^^a ^^^^decent, ^^^^liveable ^^^^one.   Having said that, I want to call bullshit on that 200k figure. I've only done some quick Googling, but the most expensive one I've been able to find so far is 45k, and it looked super high tech. I'm sure there are some that are more expensive than that, but unless it comes with all sorts of life support or something, I really don't think 200k is an average figure.
Wholesome as fuuuuck dude. The little sword fucking got me
Christ, this needs to be the number one post of all time.
I just showed my mom this because I'm sitting next to her. She just grabbed and kissed the top of my forehead....... I DON'T DESERVE THIS WOMAN
I sent this to my mom and she sent me back a heart. I‚Äôm so happy :)
I wish I could relate
I wish I'd had an actual mom. Mine lied to me all my life and should never have had me due to all of her mental state and lack of good parenting herself. When I was thirteen she told me that she had planned to kill me in my sleep, but wasn't thinking about it anymore due to the therapy she stopped only a couple months later.  If you've got a good mom that didn't fuck you up too much, keep in contact with her, tell her you love her. Good moms are hard to come by.
Dude, in all seriousness, I got so lucky with the mom life gave me. It's insane. She's like a superhuman.
Trying my best to be this kind of mom everyday.
‚ÄúBut I raised you until you were 18, I deserve some type of payback‚Äù -my mom
/u/SrGrafo is the artist and he‚Äôs amazing.
I spent over $500 yesterday getting my kid ready for middle school. Didn‚Äôt leave much for food.   I‚Äôm struggling.   As far as my kid knows? I‚Äôm just so happy she‚Äôs doing well, and we‚Äôre having chicken and rice again because I love it!  She‚Äôll never know what we‚Äôve sacrificed or struggled against so she can live a good life. Nor should she. My bills aren‚Äôt her problem.   I‚Äôll sell plasma again before she knows how close we‚Äôre burning the candle.  EDIT:  I‚Äôve received three offers of assistance and I‚Äôm really brought to tears.  Thank you all. Please donate your time, money and resources to those who need it. It‚Äôs hard what I‚Äôm doing but I‚Äôm happy to do so.   Volunteer to tutor. Be a mentor to those in need. Donate school supplies to those who can‚Äôt afford it.  Second edit:  I‚Äôm honestly so overwhelmed right now. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm any better than any other parent. I‚Äôm doing the best I can with what I have, which is what we‚Äôre called to do when we make the choice to have kids.  Reddit can be an absolute cesspool.  I‚Äôve gotten more support from this comment (that I made while taking a break from laundry) and people offering to help monetarily.  Guys if this sounded like a woe is me cash grab I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs not what I meant.  If you have anything you can donate please do. Money for those that am barely afford shoes. Time. Knowledge. Your experience. Whatever you can.  And to those of you who have sent me just... such amazing messages?  You‚Äôre what we need in this world. Your parents raised a great kid and I‚Äôm proud of all of you.  Last edit I swear:   I‚Äôm reading messages and comment between rounds of go fish as journey plays in the background. (I‚Äôm getting my butt kicked!)   The struggle to raise kids is real. We‚Äôre all in this together. We‚Äôre all doing what we can with what we have. Be kid. Love each other. You don‚Äôt know what your neighbor is going through. Kindness costs nothing but is worth billions.   Be kind. Remember what Steve Irwin and Bob Ross taught us.   I love you all three thousand. And all of you are personally invited to dinner. If you‚Äôre vegetarian or vegan lemme know so I can cook something for you!
Only you DO deserve her. All children deserve unconditional love.   The crime is that so many children don't receive it.
Especially the family problems one hit home, we got a real dysfunctional family

So the schools she‚Äôs zoned for between my ex and I are absolute bollocks.   So she goes to private school. It‚Äôs weirdly cheaper than daycare. I get a discount because of my income   In the past, I could spend $100 at old navy and she‚Äôd have her uniform.   New principal. All about that upper middle class image. Plaid branded skirts. Branded polos. Branded sweaters every Friday. That‚Äôs $300.   Oddly specific supply list. Texas Instruments graphing calculator. 3 hole punched, dark blue, 6‚Äù soft pencil case. Forest green letter sized, 7 pocket poly vinyl expanding file.   There‚Äôs another $200.
I hope that you get in a more comfortable situation. Your kid is lucky to have such a great parent :)
She‚Äôs worth it.
I'm reminded of when a dog dies in the Sims 2, Death shows up and plays fetch with them for a bit.
I'm so concerned that my dog doesn't know how happy he makes me. I really wish I had a way to communicate that to him.   Edit: I love these responses. Thank you everyone! I will continue to just be happy and receptive and attentive to my baby boy.   Edit2: I‚Äôm on mobile for the night, but first thing tomorrow, I‚Äôll upload a couple of pictures of him.

> If there are no dogs in heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went  -Will Rogers
Two days ago I just thought I was going to have to put my dog down because she had a rare birth defect that would cause her to become paralized and no surgeon could do the operation. I spent 24 hours with her preparing to take her in to put her down. One final meal. One final trick and treat. My girlfriend was still trying to teach her new tricks the morning I had to bring her in and it just broke me. I've never felt so helpless. Then two hours before I got a phone call from my vets surgeon saying he was going to take care of the surgery that normally would have cost around $10k. I don't know man. My girl is still alive and this comic just made me break down realizing how close we had come. Fuck. Dogs are the best. 
Well I guess it‚Äôs time for a good sobbing. 
I miss my dog.
Man, dog death comics absolutely kill me.
I had to put my cat down today. Otis I love you mate.
Why would they make dogs capable of dying?
I remember that! I almost fucking cried at that shit. Man, that game used to have a heart. 
He knows. 
He knows. Why else would he be so happy all that time? Him making you happy makes him happy. 
He totally knows. But if you want to really drive the message home then I recommend ear scritches and the occasional sausage.   My family dog loves sausages. They‚Äôre his absolute favourite and whenever he gets one (a rare treat) he looks at it with astonishment, and then carries it around in his mouth like a cigar, before burying it in his bed for later.   One night my dad was staying over and was sharing a room, but two separate (single) beds, with my mum. As she was drifting off to sleep my mum heard my dad fussing about, followed by a shriek. ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs this?!‚Äô my dad shouted, before pulling a raw sausage link out of his blankets. Upon realising it was a sausage his knee jerk reaction was to throw it (he‚Äôs a vegetarian, so extra unpleasant for him!). Unfortunately my mum happened to be his target, so after being disturbed by her shrieking partner she then had to deal with this sausage missile.   Once they‚Äôd calmed down they came to the conclusion that the dog must have got hold of the sausage and buried it in that bed, for some unknown reason.   Just as they were both about to try and go back to sleep their grandson wandered in, half asleep and rubbing his eyes   ‚ÄòNana, there‚Äôs a sausage in my bed...‚Äô  Evidently, our little doggy likes to share ‚ù§Ô∏è
Real talk I was at the vet with my cat this month and this dog I had never met before just knocked over all his mom‚Äôs shit so he could sit on my feet with his head in my lap  I doubt he knew I was super upset because my kitty friend was having a hard time, but he knew I was a friend and that I was sad... because dogs are fucking amazing  Your dog so very much knows. You‚Äôre the best of his friends.
The moment I could tell my dog knows he makes me happy, was the moment he gave me a Reese's from out of the candy basket at my house (still fully wrapped, of course.) I love Reese's. They're my favorite candy, and I snack on them all the time (whenever I have them.) My dog always watches me scarf them down, and one day, after I got home from work, I walked in the door to see him wagging his tail, he ran over and grabbed a Reese's and brought it to me. He really is the best boy.
Oh man remember when he has to kill the chicken for dinner and it destroys him.
"> I meant,"" said Ipslore bitterly, ""what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile?"" Death thought about it. CATS, he said eventually. CATS ARE NICE.   Discworld's Death (and Discworld in general) has so many great quotes.  Edit: since this post got me checking Discworld quotes, might as well share my favorite Death quote (more like passage, it's a bit long) (unrelated to cats unfortunately)  > ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù said Susan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not stupid. You‚Äôre saying humans need...fantasies¬†to make life bearable.‚Äù  > REALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN.

"Death is one of my all time favorite characters. Honestly I think seeing his portrayl made me less fearful of death. Makes you realize death isn't ""bad"" it just IS."
I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sure he was the best boy.
I had to put down my 15 year old pupper 3 months ago and this still made me cry and think of her. Her name was Doodle and she was the best girl!
Fuck, my dog just died yesterday. All puppers are best puppers.  edit: Thanks for the gold, /u/menonono. and thanks guys, I love this community.
The best
Not me. Straight up crying like a child.   Lost a dog I was insanely close too for 9 years 2 months ago. Still sucks. 
I'm sorry for your loss. 
There there, is okay.  ‚äÇ(’û-’û‚äÇ)
In the words of Louis Ck, it's a dry run for grandma. 
If it makes you feel better, you can turn it off in the options.
If your character died in the game, it was a lot less permanent. All you had to do was beat the grim reaper at a fiddle-off & you could come back.
Thanks! I hope so.
My dog passed late last year and this right here made me smile. I regret that I couldn't have done more with him, but part of me knows that he was happy in the end. Miss you Snoopy. 
He is a super happy dog, so hopefully you're right. Thanks!
Man what did we do to deserve dogs
> Unfortunately my mum happened to be his target, so after being disturbed by her shrieking partner she then had to deal with this sausage missile.  Nice.
I‚Äôm pretty sure the reason is definitely not unknown. His family gives him sausages when they want to show him they love him, so he give them sausages when he wants to show them that he loves them!
I bet that dog knew.   My dog who passed away a few years ago always slept upstairs in my parents room. When I was in high school my appendix started to rupture in the night and I crawled up from the basement to the main floor to lay on the cold tile because it felt better. I had barely gotten upstairs and my dog was curled up beside me on the floor and didn't take his eyes off me until my parents heard me throwing up and came to see what was going on.   I don't know how he got out of my parents room or how he knew I was in pain but my dog was right there watching over me the whole time.  I don't know how they know but they always do
Which book is that, I believe I have read all the Discworld books and don't remember Death have to kill a chicken?
Damn, I need to reread the Discworld books. Terry Pratchett had a nearly unrivaled ability to veer from funny to profound without the tone of the book changing in the slightest. 
I like that as the books progressed, and Pratchett began to realize he doesnt have much longer left, Death became more human, more compassionate, and a more welcome sight. If Anthropomorphic Personifications are a thing, then Pratchett managed to persuade enough people that Death as a person was not someone to be feared. Pratchetts Death was one last friend, one last good person before you cross over. If Death exists as a culmination of peoples beliefs as the books imply, then im sure that Pratchett had one last friend on his way out.  Not sure why. But that makes me happy. 
My girl Polly -- of 14 yrs -- died in my arms on Dec. 23 and it's still rough some days. Her 13-year -old brother looks for her every morning.  Hee gets chin scratches and cuddles.  She was a good big sister and a great pupperdog.
My condolences man. 
Mine passed a few months ago. I miss him so much. They are the best. 
Sorry to hear that, friend.  As much as it hurts, always remember you gave your fuzzball a life full of love. You did good by your dog. I bet if your dog could talk right now, they'd say how awesome you were and how grateful they were to have you as a human. You gave your dog a precious, precious gift.  And when you're ready, you can give another pupper that same gift. 
It will be 4 years for me on Tuesday since I lost my pup. Since she passed I foster hospice dogs. I‚Äôll never be able to replace her but at least I feel good about giving some dogs a warm home while they spend their last days.
(„Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•
I was way sadder when my first dog died than when my grandma passed. Huh.
You don't need to hope. Dogs can tell basic human emotions apart. Be happy and he'll know. 
Stop, you‚Äôre all making me cry üò≠ 
I tell my dog. I don‚Äôt know for sure he understands but he sure seems to act like it, which is more than I can say about most of the important human conversations I‚Äôve had. 
I've started to overthink this question a lot. Because aren't we really asking what we did to deserve such happy, unconditional love?  I think, sometimes, that we are too hard on ourselves on the answer to that question. 
Nooo! I thought I was safe from unwholesome thoughts! 
Reaperman. Technically it wasn't Death, it was Bill Door
"I love the Tweet from his daughter shortly after he died  ""AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER.   Terry took Death‚Äôs arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night. The End.""   I too like to think that the personifcation of Death greeted Sir Terry as an old friend, especially after all the great press Sir Terry gave him  "
>Her 13-year -old brother looks for her every morning  ...I'm definitely not tearing up right now.
thank you, stranger.
Try to stay calm for your best friend. Pet him/her even more than normal so he/she is feeling very conformtable, especially because he/she is at the vet.  Try to stay strong and smile, saying everything will be okay. That you will meet one another again, very soon. Tell him to be a good boy until you come back.    Stay calm for your dogfriend, thats all that matters. Please, if you feel bad then the doggo will feel bad as well.  :,(   im sorry

How close were you to your Grandma? Sometimes old people can be distant, unrelated. As if they have overstayed their welcome and are living in a world that is no longer fitted for them.   I will not be that person, not ever and not today. Most people my age don't know how to turn on a computer, heck most people my age are dead. I have recovered from strokes quite well and am lucky to be in good health. Take that for what it is, but never lose touch with the world my memes. 
I guess it worked 
Because dogs are better than people 
Yeah dude I'm telling you just go to the options
I just saw a video here of a guy faking a heart attack and his dog immediately started humping him. 
This makes me so sad because I'm terrible depressed and sometimes she gets worried and I want to be like it's not you. You're the best girl ever. It's just my stupid brain I'm sorry......but today we had fun at the park and she made a friend there. :) 
I'm very glad you were able to recover, and I'm glad you're in good health. You're welcome in the world for as long as you want to be here, so take off your shoes and stay a while!
This is true, but a more honest way of saying it is that humans are far more complicated than dogs. Even a good person can be a dick. A dog might pee on your carpet, but even then it really isn't his/her fault. 
That's love right there 
"I had a quite severe depression some years ago and during that period I, almost reluctantly, was dog-sitting a dog for months at a time. A black lab, and I love her. The thing is that during that depression, due to her being a dog, I had to take her out for walks. She kind of forced me to go outside, which is important in general and when you're depressed in particular. That helped me getting better. The other thing is that I could sit on my couch, apathetically with an empty stare just thinking how bad everything was and what a terrible person I was and find reasons why everyone probably hated me and why everything was completely meaningless. Because that's something you tend to do when you're depressed.  And when I was sitting there, empty and without meaning, she would come and look at me, concerned, while tilting her head. It looked like she was trying to be my therapist and figure out what was wrong with me. Then she would wag her tail for a while, and if I didn't react she'd stop, tilt her head again, start whining and nose bump my knee. Then she would sit back and look concerned again. If I looked at her, she'd start wagging her tail again, if I ignored her, she'd start whining again, until I focused at her.  What she didn't know was that she was doing exactly what was important and needed for me to get better: she broke my chains of negative thoughts, and she forced me to think of something else or be mindful and concentrate on the present. She would give me unconditional love, and I would feel better. She is a large, maybe the largest, part of my getting better again. I'm not sure that she knows that, but I've told her that, and shown her.  My point is that you shouldn't look at it as she's like ""oh noes, I've done something bad so you're sad"", but instead that she's like ""hey, something seems wrong and I want to help you and shower you with unconditional love and do anything I can so you feel better, because I love you and I have a lot of fun stuff I've planned for us, and I need you if we're going to do that, and we're going to do that, because I love you and you're a good human, yes you are, who's the best human, you are"".  She wants to help in any way she can, and she wants to help because she loves you and she's a dog and dogs are the best thing ever invented.  Don't listen to your brain. Listen to your dog. She's probably seeing this way clearer than you right now.  Also: you're worth something, and shit can get better. If you ever should trust an anonymous internet user telling you something, this is the time.  Edit: I saw the picture you posted of your dog and wanted to show my friend. [This is the one I love.](https://img.tglab.uz/28263038/15171890895a6e77e1450db.jpg)"
That's fantastic. Personally, I still read the old newspaper but I also like to use the new mediums. Sometimes I'll just ask my descendants what they do on the internet and have a little go at it, whether be it be games, childish stuff or stuff that doesn't particularly interest me in this here lifetime.  
"That and dogs are loyal to a fault. My dog sleeps with me and she is very protective. Once I had a girlfriend over and the next morning she tried to wake me up by shoving me with her foot (for context, she woke a bit before and was standing next to my bed. It was a friendly shove, not aggressive). I woke up but didn't want to get up yet, so she shoved me again, but this time my dog wasn't having it, so she nipped at the girlfriends foot. I had to act all upset at my dog, but I could barely hold back how proud of her I was. Of course I have trained her not to nip people anymore, but I still loved the fact she ""protected"" me from waking up"
He‚Äôs trying to hump him back to life. Smart dogs can be taught CPR. Dumb dogs do HUMP-R.
If anything, older voices should be given less of a true voice. The world is changing for the better, I love hearing impassioned young people talk. Old people rarely have anything interesting to say, they bore me very much.   I am not someone to be looked up to and thus I cannot truly look down on the youth of today. On some of my worst days, the youth may get under my skin but that's how the changing of times works. 
Oh wow, that woman is DEFINITELY Seth Rogan's mom.
they look EXACTLY what id expect one of the most prolific stoners parents to look like
‚ÄúMom can you and dad drive me to talk show later?‚Äù 
huhuhuhhuhuh (seth rogen noises)  
He always seems slightly confused about his fame.  
Why does his dad look like Jonah Hill in costume?
I love his Mums Instagram. She takes photos of his movie posters and tags him in them. It‚Äôs just so sweet.  
They look so proud!!
I‚Äôve never seen someone so perfectly embody the culmination of two people before. Amazing.
Is Seth‚Äôs mom Professor Trelawney?
Her name is Sandy and she's a really nice lady. 
Still rocking that wardrobe they haven‚Äôt updated since 1975
I‚Äôm jealous of the probable fact that they all smoke together.
Let‚Äôs Uber, I‚Äôm high AF.
"""have you cleaned your bongs and pipes yet?"""
Seth Rogen's laugh makes me very uncomfortable.
I know what you mean. But imagine being super high, only everyone you see knows who you are, expects you to always be funny, and wants to take a selfie with you. I‚Äôd probably look slightly confused too.
RT of the year, that was fantastic.
Her whole Twitter is gold lol. 
Actually Jonah Hill is his dad in costume
Because he is
Look up Blake Griffin with his parents.  Edit: I did it for you: [https://i.imgur.com/v6YAabR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/v6YAabR.jpg)
Is she the woman that played the woman from Harry Potter that looks into the future or some shit like that
When it works, it works!
"You just know Seth used to come home baked as a teenager and his mom would ask him what's up and he'd go ""just hanging at Joey's"" and shed give him a little smile nod and a ""mhhmm"""
‚ÄúI said I‚Äôd do it when we got hoooooome. Huehuehue‚Äù
He gets it from his mother
"""wait... You guys are all cool with me being baked right now? ... And you want me to star in your movie? Uhhhh okay I guess, wasn't really doing anything else important today"""
No, that was Emma Thompson. Sandy Rogen could probably play professor Trelawny for sure though. :)
You can‚Äôt argue with results. 
I literally read this in his voice üòÇ
Holy shit, that was Emma Thompson?!
Yes and watch the extra scene of her eating in the great Hall (during one of dumbledores speeches I think), if you haven't already
https://youtu.be/8ldI_zGXWdE
Thank you for that, it‚Äôs a shame they had to cut that scene, just so perfect. 
I'd dout it was cut. I'd say it was just an extra scene they made for fun because it wouldn't make sense to have the camera on her for that scene. 
Now that's cute! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wholesomeness on a whole 'nother level, coming from my mind
Where are the bike pedals?
this warmed my cold dead heart
This is wholesome but the tires are gonna be stolen
This does bring me joy
Explain please
It's a balance bike.  Increasingly popular among today's 2-5 crowd.
"The hard part of learning to ride a bike is the balance part, not so much the pedaling part.  These (balance bikes) let your kids get on a bike sooner, learn the balance aspect without complications In a safer manner and just skip training wheels altogether.  On top of that, many pedal bikes this small (12"" wheels) are either badly designed and heavy to save money, or too expensive to justify buying for a toddler."
And what happened, then? Well, in Whoville they say ‚Äì that the Grinch‚Äôs small heart grew three sizes that day.
Robbers Will go away because of the wholesomness
r/unexpectedthanos
It‚Äôs a joke from an anime called JoJo‚Äôs bizarre adventure, which is an icon of meme culture. In one particular episode the characters start to dance randomly. The first line of the song they dance to starts off with ‚Äúvocal percussion on a whole ‚Äònother level coming from my mind‚Äù. Your title probably reminded him of that
Is it powered by imagination or something?
happy cake day
Thanks for explaining!
Same drivetrain as the Flintstone's car.
You push with your feet but some come with attachable pedals. It's supposed to help your kid bypass training wheels because balancing is the hard part/scary part.
This does put a smile on my face
The dance is called torture dance, because as you can probably guess, someone was being tortured while they danced. Now I know that this didn't add much to the conversation, but I just wanted to say it.

"This is a thing. It's called familiar strangers.  From Wikipedia: Familiar stranger...

You don‚Äôt understand the impact you have on someone else‚Äôs life until you aren‚Äôt there. Just because they never spoke, a special connection can still form and I think that‚Äôs beautiful 
Kinda like when you're driving for a long period and you stay with someone for mile after mile and they turn off.   Then you're faced with more miles alone and your buddy is gone.
This kind of stuff can get really crazy.  Stories like this where perfect strangers never speak but one passes away... the other just sits wondering what happened.
"There was a homeless guy in his 40s(?) with a big beard and in the same clothes etc, who sat by where I get breakfast on the way to work. Every morning I would get him a coffee with milk and 3 sugars and a bacon roll. He would say ""thanks, have a good day"" then I'd say ""no bother, see you tomorrow"". I didn't know his name but he always seemed happy and grateful to just get breakfast.   This became a routine for almost a year, then one day he wasn't there. Then the next, and the next. I contacted the nearby shelters to see if they knew anything but I got nothing. I started feeling genuinely scared something had happened to him so I started asking any homeless people I met if they knew anything. But without a name I wasn't getting anywhere.   A month or so went by and I had lost hope TBH, but I still went for breakfast at the same place. Then one day when it came to paying, a man stopped me and said it was on him. It took a while to register who it was, but it was my nameless homeless friend, he was in clean clothes and shaven looking better than ever. After having a chat it turns out he got a job after years of trying, on the early shift at a local factory. He had just saved enough to put a deposit down on his first rented flat. He was there to repay me for getting him breakfast all those times. I have never felt happier for someone, we still get breakfast time to time and he is doing well to this day :)"
When my family and I lived in Japan we stayed in a home in Ikego for a while. My bus stop to take me to school on base was right next to a convenience store across the street from a line of homes facing it. Every day, at around 6-7 in the morning, I would stand out there to wait and watch a businessman get into his car to go to work.  After the first week or so he started bowing to me before he would get into his car, and I politely bowed back. Sometimes we waved to one another, but mostly we stuck to bowing.  One day, months later, it seems he was going to be gone a while, I assume a business trip of some sort. His wife came out to see him off. After he closed his door and drove away his wife turned to me and gave me a deep, formal bow.  It suddenly struck me then that he must have told her about me and the routine we shared. The fact that two (three technically) strangers could share such an emotional bond has never ceased to impact me.
"I am a creature of habit. I don't like new things in an unfamiliar environment, I'm very set in where I do my shopping, that sort of thing. Every day on my way in to work I stop by the same convenience store to get a drink, a bag of chips and sometimes a peanut butter cookie from that ""Grandma's"" brand. This has been an ongoing thing since I was promoted to another department with normal working hours, probably for about the past two years. The same person is usually at the register. She's an African American woman who is often on a bluetooth headset having a conversation with someone in a language I don't understand, it sounds African, she may be an immigrant. All I really know is that even with the language barrier that whomever she is speaking to is someone she cares deeply for with all of her soul.   Anyway, I took vacation last year. Vacation for me is a week of not leaving my home, playing with my cat, getting some cleaning done and probably playing a crap ton of video games. I came back the next week and when I got to the register I found myself being chastised because she did not see me all last week.  I was very taken back, and it was a feeling that I'm not used to experiencing. I don't think a lot of myself, in fact I think incredibly poorly of myself and in general consider myself a bad person for the thoughts I have sometimes. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder if my mother and others would be better off just having the insurance money from my death. It was.. foreign to me that someone noticed I wasn't around. I've often assumed that if I died in my sleep it would be a couple of days before someone realized something had happened to me.   But no... the kind woman with her bluetooth headset, who always has my items bagged by the time I've swiped my card, notices it if I don't come in at my usual time. And what's funny is that when she isn't there I find myself annoyed with whomever is at the register because I have to ask them to do things she just does as part of her job to make her day better for her customers. I couldn't tell you anything about her other than that she has a genuinely kind smile and has very lively conversations in a language I can't understand with someone whom she loves very much and that somehow this person telling me to have a good day makes me feel like any other person in the world: the people I find myself wishing I was."
I work at a gas station and it‚Äôs amazing. All of the morning regulars know each other just from coming into the gas station for coffee and cigarettes in the morning. They chat while they make their coffees and tell each other to have a good one before they leave. Sometimes they even buy each other‚Äôs coffee or pop. They don‚Äôt know each other from anywhere else but the gas station. It‚Äôs wonderful. Mornings are my favorite parts of working midnights. 
This is adorable, can't wait to see this one reposted about one million times.
I have a commute buddy. He‚Äôs a big gay man who I stand next to. We have never said a word to each other, but we‚Äôll always smile at each other when we see each other around the small city where we work, and we time our getting up and going to the train in the mornings.   It‚Äôs a weirdly nice part of my day. He doesn‚Äôt work on Mondays though which makes me feel a bit lonely but he always comes back. 
When I was working one of my first jobs in my early 20s I used to have this fairly long commute including a 40 minute train journey.   There was this cute girl probably around my age who I always ended up sitting across from every day. For me, at least, it wasn't even like I was deliberately sitting across from her; it was just that the train was still fairly empty where I got on so I had a choice and I liked to sit in one particular carriage and seat for reasons of convenience when getting off and legroom comfort. She was definitely cute and I would sneak looks at her, though.  One day after several months (so we definitely both recognised each other, even if we'd never spoken) I happened to be looking out the window and caught her eye when she looked up as I was turning back round. She gave me this really sweet, friendly, big, familiar smile. I immediately panicked, stared down at my book with a blank expression, and was careful to never make eye contact again until I moved jobs and started getting a different train.  I'm in my mid 30s now. I'm thoroughly well adjusted. I have a partner who I live with, love more than anything, and want to spend my life with. But I still sometimes think of that moment, cringe, and wonder what might have happened if I'd smiled back.  Edit: oh one more thing. I remember her looking sad as I frantically broke eye contact to stare at my book. Hahahaha. Jesus fuck 18-25 year old me.
I used to take the train to my very early job and sometimes I‚Äôd fall asleep on my way. I always sat in the same place and a woman who didn‚Äôt speak English always sat in the same place across from me. Without fail, every day that I fell asleep she would wake me up at my stop. We never spoke otherwise but I always felt like she was my friend. 
There is this one regular I see on my commute almost every day. Every time we see each other it‚Äôs always sneaky eye contact. Like looking at each other but not actually acknowledging each other.  I feel like too awkward to say anything now so whenever it happens I start laughing to myself so I look like an even crazier person so yeah.
I always go to this little coffee/doughnut shop right next to where I do laundry to get coffee and change. I was behind on laundry one week, and when I finally got around to doing it, this sweet old Chinese lady behind the counter who I had hardly spoken to, asked me where I had been. Now we have full conversations every week and she gives me life advice
It's common in India for commuter to make groups of commuter friends. They hold seats, play card games, chit chat, etc. He's surely not a stranger to commuter friends if he's a first generation Indian
"I used to have a bus ride like this. There was this nice dude and his daughter that would share most of the same route and time (he'd get off a few stops earlier and drop his daughter off at preschool then continue to roughly where I worked, too). We'd make a bit of small talk from time-to-time.  One week I had to go in early and so we rode at different times. When I resumed my regular schedule he explained that's it's common in Chinese culture for children to refer to parents' friends as ""Uncle"" regardless biological relationships and when I was not on the bus after a few days she asked her Dad ""where's uncle?""."
Awww I hope they became commute buddies and started chatting in the mornings. 
You hear of these stories and some actually have the courage to talk and they end up getting married and having great lives. That's how one of my best friends met their spouse and they have 2 kids now and live in a house in the suburbs. 
"""I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes."" -Ron Swanson"
This reminds me of a group I used to see on my way to drop my son off at daycare. Every morning I‚Äôd see two older woman walking arm in arm while two older men walked side by side behind them. They‚Äôd all be laughing and chatting and were out even on cold or rainy days. I always noticed how happy they looked.  And then one day the two men and one women were walking three abreast down the sidewalk, clinging desperately onto one another and sobbing as they walked slowly down the street.  The three of them continued their walking routine for as long as we lived there, but I never saw them again without feeling a pang of sorrow.
I have a very similar story that happened last night. I have a Korean-Canadian parking neighbour at my building and there is a bit of a language barrier so we never really said much to each other. Seems like a normal dude, never any issues with him just never had a reason to talk to him. Last night I came home and someone was parked in my spot with their car on (probably waiting for someone) and my parking neighbour was out at their window telling them to move, its not their spot. I pulled up as they were pulling away and after i thanked him he said that he thought i got a new car but when he saw it wasnt me he asked them to move.   Such a small gesture but it really meant a lot to me. Its kind of unexplainable but I love the unspoken connections formed with people. Same thing when youre driving on the highway with the same group of cars for a while  Edit: fixed some grammar and changed Korean to Korean-Canadian
I have about a half dozen people I regularly see at my home station or who get off at the same part of the platform in the city as me. I don't know their names. We don't talk. But they are my people. And if something ever goes down, I'll go to war for them.
A Swanson familiar.    ‚ÄúI once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.‚Äù
I had tons of these when I lived downtown in a large urban center. This one dude and I had almost the exact same sleep schedule and our dogs had synchronized bladders. Almost every night I‚Äôd be across the street with my dog and I‚Äôd look up and he‚Äôd be kitty corner away from me with his corgi.  Our dogs, always and without fail, would scream at each other, but for whatever reason he and I never interacted. We‚Äôd kind of exchange sheepish looks while our dogs barked their faces off, and then we‚Äôd each haul them away in opposite directions.  The song and dance went on for almost two years, and then I moved. I hope he‚Äôs well. 
I moved to my first apartment about 3 years ago. Everyday before work, I drive to the gas station across the street and this older gentleman would be there either gassing up his corvette or wiping it down. We‚Äôd never say hi, how are you, or anything for that matter. I noticed him every day and still do to this day. It‚Äôll be pretty sad when we no longer ‚Äúgreet‚Äù each other in the mornings. 
I used to see a girl every day outside of a library for a few years, never spoke to her, then my family moved away. Few years later I get to high school and sit next to a girl, start talking to her, become best friends, and she mentioned how close we could have been if we made friends those years back. I never made the connection until then, and it was amazing. She said she missed me when I disappeared, and I thought of her sometimes.
You can't control who's part of your life, but you can control who's life you're part of. I should start talking to my daily strangers. 
When I was in high school working at a Piggly Wiggly, an older couple opened a little bistro restaurant. I'd go over there on my breaks and they always treated me like a son. Then they were just closed up and gone one day. Met the man a few years later and his wife caught cancer and died, then he moved. He told me that she always looked forward to when i come over for a burger and told her friends about me. Really good people, i didnt even realize i had that kind of impact on them
I love it when due to different rest stops, etc. you end up catching up with each other later in the day. It's like seeing an old friend again.
I hate being the person that has to turn off. Sometimes when I'm on a common commute, and if I found someone to follow, I try not to take shortcuts and keep following them. 
Yes! On longer interstate trips I‚Äôve rolled down the window and waved goodbye to a few ‚Äòbuddies‚Äô while exiting the highway. Usually for those that I could tell wanted a buddy too; traveling the same speed, leaving room when both changing lanes and overall respect while driving together.   I like to think the farewell meant something to them too :)
I left Jacksonville, FL one day on I-10 and just fell in with a line of 8-10 cars doing a little over 90mph.  I figured there was safety in numbers and followed along....for over 200 miles.  We passed two state troopers that I saw who didn't move.  When I turned off in Marianna after a couple of hours the two cars in front of me and the one behind me all waved.  It was just one of those passing, magical little moments that makes life entertaining.
For ten years I would wave at this old man that lived at the end of my street. Mostly when we were taking our trash out to the curb (which happened with an odd degree of synchronicity over the years) or when I saw him mowing the lawn and I was walking my dog. I could have drawn a picture of the guy I knew his face so well, but I never stopped to chat with him or even learned his name.  One day I noticed his trash can was still at the curb two days after trash pickup. I went down, took it up to the side of the garage, and then knocked on the door to check in on him. An old woman answered and I asked if the man was OK because it was the first time I'd seen the can left out at the curb in all the years I'd lived down the street. It turns out he'd passed away the week before and, to say the least, her routine was a little bit off.   That was years ago and I still walk down the street every week to take the trash out and mow the lawn in his stead. Over cups of tea with his wife and dinners at our home I've learned his name was Gerald, he was a Korean War veteran, and he took a lot of pride in his lawn and his flower garden.   Anyways, I guess the point is... take time now and then to meet your perfect strangers. 
This is a beautiful story. You both sound like great people :) 
This is so amazing and encouraging 
Thank you for sharing this. Thanks for sharing your breakfast. 
I live in FL & work at a restaurant.. we used to have this homeless man, Gregory, come in every day and order a soda and just sit at the bar and watch tv for hours, to escape the heat. It‚Äôs so damn hot so we didn‚Äôt blame him, and didn‚Äôt mind either. He always kept to himself. He had a couple bags that he would drop off at the host stand and we would make sure no one touched them. It became so routine we would just comp a dish and his soda for him every day. Then we were (indirectly) hit by a hurricane last season, and everyone had to evacuate. No one saw him after that. We were all really worried and decided to raise money so that if he did come back, he would have a little financial cushion.   Well he never made his way back.. and I thought of him very often and worried about him. My late brother was homeless for a while at the peak of his mental illness, and Gregory reminded me a lot of him. I was scared something happened to Greg as it‚Äôs a very hard life.   Until a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve been going through a hard time and heartbreak so I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist. Her office is on the opposite side of town, an area I typically wouldn‚Äôt visit, but it was the only practice I could get in. Well, I was ubering the 40 minutes home and as I was sitting in the back seat starring out the window thinking about life, we came to a stop at a light. Who do I see sitting at the bus stop? Gregory.   I couldn‚Äôt help but smile really big. Maybe his circumstances haven‚Äôt dramatically changed, it seemed like he‚Äôs still living on the streets... but he‚Äôs safe. 
That is the best and somehow so Japanese. I love it. 
That's very heartwarming to hear, thanks for sharing
People care.  I don't know you and I'm a grown ass adult who just had a tear come to my eye while reading this.  Good luck, stranger. 
Hey. I know how you feel. Brutal feeling for sure. People do care though. Life is just busy.   I had a total implosion from this feeling once. I was like 6 months single out of an 8 year relationship, and in a city where literally all of my friends I hung out with regularly were her family members (brothers, cousins), so I was suddenly just alone. They still loved me or whatever but it was awkward so we just cut ties.    I was finishing my degree, so I just did math all day, and worked in a kitchen all night. I had supported her through her school, and she was supposed to do the same for me, but that didn‚Äôt happen. As a consequence I didn‚Äôt really have time to branch out socially while finishing my degree, as I had to work to put myself through school. Outside of work talk in the kitchen the only people I spoke to were bus drivers, baristas, and the girl who scanned my pass at my gym every day. I wasn‚Äôt really conscious of this though I was just going through the motions.   One day while doing math alone in my room I had this crazy moment that came totally out of nowhere. I mean I was so focused on my school work I wasn‚Äôt thinking about my life at all, but my brain suddenly on its own switched gears completely and I realized all at once I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time someone was happy to see me. I just felt this deep aching loneliness and broke down crying. It was so weird I didn‚Äôt know all that empty was there until then. It showed me how important a social life can be for people. I didn‚Äôt realize it until I felt it‚Äôs absence, but I think a feeling of belonging in a intimate community, like a tribe, is deeply important to a healthy and fulfilling life.
I work at a grocery store and mornings are the best!
Yeah I have a similar situation, except I work the overnight at the gas station, and that‚Äôs when the crackheads show up to buy their glass roses and chore bores. It‚Äôs truly touching, the way they yell at me when the prices on their cigarettes go up, as if I had anything to do with the change. 
Wait has it been posted before?! :(
wait how do you know he is gay if you havent spoken?
This is like r/yesyesyesno in text form. Fuck!  Edit: You have to go back to the train and find her. If you do, convince her to have a threesome with you and your current partner.
How would she know it was your stop   Edit: never mind I realized she just saw you get out at that stop when you weren‚Äôt sleeping
I can be socially awkward/anxious, but sometimes will just think fuck it, what do I have to lose, and interact with that person. And have always felt better for doing it, no matter what the outcome.
I think it's just a way of giving him a little life while showing they know nothing about him because they haven't spoken. It doesn't matter if you then imagine him looking like Gandhi, Geronimo, or an old Indian friend of yours, he has a face now and is a little more of a person to you. For some people he might speak in an accent, although he didn't to me.
> We don't talk. But they are my people. And if something ever goes down, I'll go to war for them.   I like this. 
Every now and then something out of the ordinary will happen on my train and my peeps and I briefly comment on it for 15 seconds or so. 
I get this. You‚Äôve observed their lives over your time commuting and decided that they are probably good, honest people not too unlike yourself despite your different background, at the very least they don‚Äôt seem to be bad people. So you‚Äôre willing to defend them for that. That‚Äôs good. 
I thought the same thing until i got jumped at a train station by five guys and not one person, some of who i worked with helped out or even called the police.
You really should just go up to him and say hi. Or wave, even a smile will do. 
"Similar thing happened to me. The owner of a 7-11/gas station right near my house is a really awesome guy. Many years ago I asked if he knew about Lime/Cucumber Gatorade as I tried it a year prior when I was training in Texas. It was instantly my favorite and I could not find it ANYWHERE in my area.  The owner said he never heard of it, but he'll look it up. The next day he was so excited when he told me that he contacted his Pepsi distributor who said they will start shipping it to him the very next week.   Well that next week he had it stocked and I was super happy and he had a huge smile.  I always made a stop at that 7-11 almost every other day for a few years just to get that Gatorade and sometimes some snacks and to see the owner. We always were happy to see each other.  Well at one point in my career, I switched schedules to a much earlier shift. The route I used to take which would have me drive right by this 7-11 used to be a fair amount quicker during rush hour, but now during my earlier shift, it's actually much longer. I decided to take a different, more direct route to work and it turned out to be about 20 mins quicker because it was pretty much a straight line down the main highway. I ended up taking that route regularly which meant I'd not go to the same 7-11 anymore. I'd end up going to a different 7-11 which was along my new route, however they did not have the Lime/Cucumber Gatorade, and I never bothered to ask because it wouldn't be as special as before.  Well a couple months after, I REALLY wanted some Lime/Cucumber Gatorade and since that was pretty much the only 7-11 in the entire area which had it (apparently it's not very popular in the DC area), I made a stop to that 7-11.  The owner was like, ""Where have you been? I've missed you!"" and my heart melted. We reconnected and I bought the Gatorade and told him I'd be back more often, which I am a bit more, but usually on the way home when he's less likely to be in. I think I'll pay him a trip on Monday."
It‚Äôs really interesting because you don‚Äôt know what anyone else is truly feeling and just a simple smile or wave can really change someone‚Äôs life. Whether you ever go talk to him or not, I‚Äôd bet the impact is there.
My dad was exactly like this guy. If you really want to make his damn year, give him literally anything relating to the vett. Every time my father talked to someone about that car (near me at least) he would bring up this keychain that a complete stranger that happened to live next door gave him like 7 years ago. The guy only even talked to him for like 30 seconds lmao
There's so much story behind this paragraph that the incorrect grammar even adds to the mystery of it all. 
Hey there blue Corolla, it's been a long time. How I've missed you.  \- Silver Focus.
"My wife always laughs about how excited this makes me.   ""Holy shit look! Honey! It's the 2008 Explorer with the Rhode Island plates! He's back!"""
Or when you‚Äôre on vacation and you keep seeing the same people at different attractions because y‚Äôall are following a similar trip plan. Or when you‚Äôre going to several estate sales/yard sales in one area and you see the same people at every one. 
See I'm always scared to do this because I'm scared they'll think I'm following them on purpose and get creeped out :( I don't want anyone to get creeped out!
Shit the feels man.. Good on you for taking on those tasks willingly, the world needs more people like you
You just made someone on the other side of the planet shed a few tears
Damn. This is beautiful. I'm sad you didn't get to hear any of his stories. Do you regret not talking to him? 
It really is. I blame my years of living there for my inherent need to bow when receiving a compliment or taking something from someone.  It is a very polite gesture, but seems weird when you are in America.
Oh, no, it hasn't.  That's what I mean.  A lot of the really adorable stuff like this tends to get reposted, *a lot*.  Like, remember the one text post about the babysitter and Wall-e?  I tend to sit around in the new tab a lot, so I always see tons of reposts of wholesome text posts like this.  So I'm just predicting a ton of reposts for this one.
Sometimes he‚Äôs there with his partner, I‚Äôm assuming  they‚Äôre together anyway, they kiss goodbye when we leave the station
"Hmm. My girlfriend is not at all the jealous type and generally up for trying new things within reason.   However, I think a grand sex caper of ""let's hunt down a woman who I know nothing about, who I've never even spoken to, but who I used to have a crush on from a distance and stare at on public transport when I was 22, then both bang her together"" might test her forbearance."
Hahaha I‚Äôm imagining her just waking up strangers and saying ‚Äúwake up it‚Äôs your stop now‚Äù

/u/hwarang_ if I write a movie or book or short story or something, do I have your permission to steal that? Cause it sounds fuckin lovely, and if I were to try to rephrase it, it would either come out too close to yours or shittier.
"i like when a crazy/angry person gets on the bus and all the regular dudes kinda give each other a look and give a slight nod like: ""threat identified, continue monitoring. we all got each others back if shit goes down."" "
The more people who witness an event like that, the more likely that nobody will do anything about it. There are lots of interesting studies on the phenomenon.  I like to call it mob apathy
You're welcome. But that will fuck up the unspoken bond, no?
Yeah, I bet it will really make his day, especially since you see him everyday. 
HI, IVE BEEN JUST UHHH WANTED TO HI SAY SEEN YOU FOR MANY YEARS SINCE I COME HERE TOO, UH SOME PEOPLE ONLINE CONVINCED ME TO SPEAK SINCE I WRITE ABOUT YOU, FUCK, UHH NICE CAR HAHA K.  *gets back in car.*   *forgot to go into store to pay for gas.*   *can't get back out and nearly out of gas.*   *can never return to this gas station again.*
Why is this making me cry? Well, not really crying, but my eyes are watery. Like the precum of tears.
‚ù§ miss u bby
I did a Groupon trip all around Ireland for my honeymoon and we must have chosen a departure date for the same package like a day ahead of another couple--- we kept seeing them everywhere, checking in, on the town, etc...we're weird introverts but after like the third restaurant we saw them in (this was after like seven other times seeing them in different towns, lol) they finally approached us like, 'so we see we're traveling together!'--they were cool and we drank together, glad they broke the ice!
"Oh whew, okay. I went through ""top"" posts from the past week to make sure. Okay! Thanks friend"
they just homies  it ain't gay to kiss ya homies before work man its 2018
We don't talk. But they are my people. And if something ever goes down, I'll go to war for them.   Look what I made.  
"In this context, it would be ""every day,"" and not ""everyday."" It's one word when used as an adjective, as in, ""everyday occurrences."" (as opposed to ""occurrences happen every day,"" or ""every day, occurrences happen"")."
/r/evenwithcontext
Hmm ‚Äúprecum of tears‚Äù that‚Äôs one way to say it
Miss you too, Virgin_Dildo_Lover.
What‚Äôs better than that, guys bein dudes
Whoa, that‚Äôs pretty cool! But have I shown you what I made?  We don't talk. But they are my people. And if something ever goes down, I'll go to war for them.  /s
TiL
I made this.
U made this?
grammar*. Ironic, he could save others from mistakes but not himself. 
I made this.
I never knew my father! *cries in finding nemo shark voice*
My dad is one of my best friends, even if he has to wake up at 6 and gets home at 17 he still has energy for none sense
I hope I‚Äôll one day be a dad like this.
This is the most wholesome way I've seen this meme be used
I named my son after my dad. When he asked why I told him it was because I wanted to be reminded everyday on how to be a good father.
Can confirm. I only get to see my son a couple hours a night most nights due to working. But there‚Äôs nothing in this world I wouldn‚Äôt do for him.
Wholesome but sad for the people who work their lives away
I feel the same, he passed away when I was a teen.
Good man.  I work 12 hour shifts myself and it is honestly sometimes difficult to play with my 2 young children (2 & 4 years), but if i dont make the time ill regret it hard later
A noble goal my friend, I hope you live up to it!
You should see the mother version of this one I love it as well  Found it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/cyfzch/nothing_like_moms_unconditional_love/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Aww that‚Äôs so sweet!
Can you be my dad
Same, friend. Weird how life takes a sudden lurch in a different direction.
Not a shift worker but I used to spend 12-16hrs a day commuting/working. Never got to see my kids so took a large cut to be closer to home and less hours. Best investment I ever made.
I didn't realize until a couple years ago how lucky I am that my dad is still alive  and well at 62. Though last year his doc did tell him that if he didn't live healthier he was at risk of developing diabetes. So he went from drinking a few beers every night and eating a robust diet of hamburgers and hotdogs, and never working out for 15 years, to drinking only a couple days a week, eating exclusively poultry and veggies, and running every other day. Also this fucker, on his first run in 15 years, ran 3 miles in half an hour, which ain't bad for a guy over 60.
You're a good man.
I love this meme. It makes me feel cozy and warm inside :-)

While it is sad that Steve Irwin is dead, I think there is something to celebrate. Steve Irwin's death was a fairly long time ago now, yet the impact of it on everyone has honestly seemed to stay the same. It goes to show the legacy he left behind, while Steve himself is dead, his memory truly does live on with everyone remembering him so fondly.
you beautiful person 
Same, imagine how many more seasons of crocodile hunter, Terri and Steve would live happily ever after, Bindi and Robert would still continue the Irwin legacy of conservation but with their dad watching in person, he would personally destroy PETA, it would be fabulous.
It's been 13 years!?!? 
I think Steve Irwin would probably want this guy to kill hitler 
Then he could save the reef
Hmm............... I‚Äôd still kill Hitler 
Crikey!  What we have here, guys, is a causality loop!  VERY dangerous!
Same
Exactly! I mean, look at how many people came out to defend him when PETA made their comment the other day. People defended this man simply because he was a wholesome person with a heart of gold.  His death left behind a legacy that we all have to move forward with. He was an inspiration to us all, and changing that might not have left us with the same effect. 
Can you imagine the amount of awesome you would have preserved?
And when he got too old to be jumping on crocs and climbing rocks and into caves he would become the next David Attenborough 
He's too nice too bother with PETA.
September 4, 2006 ): 
Or, and hear me out, save Steve Irwin and team up to beat Hitler. 
If Irwin was alive he'd be doing so much environmental work, especially in his home country with the great barrier reef. Not only do we miss him, this planet misses him
Hmm no Hitler means no world war 2 means no enigma machine means no computers means no time travel means yes Hitler means yes ww2 means yes time travel means no Hitler etc  But I do sorta think this tweet is saying Steve Irwin is more important than 6 million Jews + millions of war casualties which is sort of a wack thing to say IMO.
The Rogers Effect      \- Made this up but hope  to see it in a paper someday 
And now I‚Äôm imagining a new version of planet earth narrated by Steve.   It‚Äôs a bad day for rain. 
He cares about animals too much not to
Steven Irwin died before The Black Parade by My Chemical Romance came out? This seriously reconstructs my idea of what my life timeline has been like. 
I would totally watch that movie! 
I thought of Fred Rogers too.  There are some people you don't fuck with, they're two of them.
Killing Hitler would have most likely made the war even worse and could have potentialy just created a bigger and worse German power.
‚ÄúBut sir, it isn‚Äôt raining‚Äù
He‚Äôd ask them nicely to stop being horrible. 
Is there a sub for unexpected MCR references? There should be.
I'd say Bob Ross too, though I'm sure the people he trained in the military would say otherwise! 
Not if you kill little 3 year old hitler, say what you will about toddler murder it is......easy.
Wait, wut?
Instead of murdering someone, why not just help him get into art school? 
"[His Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross?wprov=sfla1)  >Military career In 1961, 18-year-old Ross enlisted in the United States Air Force and was put into service as a medical records technician.:15 He eventually rose to the rank of master sergeant and served as the first sergeant of the U.S. Air Force Clinic at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where he first saw the snow and mountains that later became recurring themes in his artwork. He developed his quick-painting technique to create art for sale during brief daily work breaks. Having held military positions that required him to be, in his own words, ""tough"" and ""mean"", ""the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work"", Ross decided that if he ever left the military, he would never yell or raise his voice again."
HE was an air force Drill Sargent for 20+ years . Retired and said he would never yell again.
Thats less easy
Damn, I cannot picture that. Lol, I'm just imagine him beating the devil out of his recruits with paint brushes üòÇ
Totally, have you _seen_ his portfolio? Yikes.
Just gotta beat the devil out of these recruits *smiles warmly at the camera*
#HAPPY LITTLE MAGGOTS
Not yikes at all. He was very good, but it was too technical and lacked any feeling or emotion.
Happy little push-ups!
With moves like that there is only success
‚ÄúBro you suck‚Äù  ‚ÄúHold on a sec‚Äù *gets up and dances just to do a magnificent slide around that person*
I feel like I should play this to myself every morning.
This guy made my year
The last bit fucking did me in.
Roy Purdy is a gem, I recommend watching his dance videos.
"""Hm, yeah, yeah I can do this in 2018!""  -slides past the ""depression"" sign-  r/absolutelynotme_irl"
My 2018 is going to be infinitely better than 2017. I've been struggling with my health for about 1.5 years and yesterday I figured out why.  Apparently I don't absorb vitamin B12 from my food so my storage was depleted (it lasts 5 years, it's been about 6 or 7 years since I last had injections because of a vitamin B12 deficiency). I got a shot of vitamin B12 this morning (8 or 9 hours ago) and I already started feeling better. After being sick for 9 weeks straight, it's amazing.  I'll finally have energy to do more fun stuff again. I'll be able to concentrate better, my hypermobility will bother me less (this deficiency can also cause joint issues). It's going to be an amazing year with amazing friends here, on discord and at school! 
Made me smile, thank you brightly coloured dancing man :)
This is great, the only improvement i can think of for this would be to have two depression signs with a narrow gap, because depression is tough to get past.
Those Back to the Future / Pizza Hut shades tho
But if I ditch my fake friends I will no longer have friends.
This is definitely what you should do. We should all do this! If enough of us start it will be completely socially acceptable. You go first though. 
I find that playing with myself every morning to be effective as well.
His name is Roy Purdy - I'd advise you to see some of his other videos, they're very funny.
"I saw a video of him a month or so back and though he was corny as hell. Then I saw another one of him and recognized the glasses and didn't think much of it again, I figured he was one of the prank bros or YouTube personalities. Then I realized he's just an upbeat person always dancing around and seemingly having a good time so I stopped looking at the ""cool"" factor and just saw him as wholesome and funny. Props to him."
the knees and elbows, them joints are wild!!
Roy Purdy is a legend.
Oh wow, I had no idea what he looked like without the mannequin head but I was thinking this looked similar to the way he moves in those videos. 
Yeah if anyone figures out how I can slide around my depression, please let me know
We've never met, but I'm glad to hear you're doing better. 
You can always try and find new ones 
*>going outside*  nahh
Me sex thanks
Is this the same guy that did cool guy?  The dancing is very familiar...
That‚Äôs what I thought too. But all he does is dance around and have a good time, doesn‚Äôt really bother anyone either. He actually goes to University of Colorado Boulder and I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw him once dressed as a banana walking around- pretty funny. But there‚Äôs a few videos of him messing around with people while in costume and it looks like everyone‚Äôs having a good time.
I couldn't even dream of moving like that.  Then again I just ate lunch and am pretty darn full right now.

Well, and thats the hard part.   I couldn't manage it in the last 4 years of university, there's no hope for me in the last one considering that I already know the people there (and haven't connected) and the class is only shrinking...      **edit:** Too many nice comments here for me to reply, but thanks for the kind words of encouragement anyway!

"""Just go outside and exercise. That's what I do. I don't see why you can't."" - People who don't understand"
"My parents used to tell me ""college is where you make your real friends"" which I found to be 100% not true for me.  After college, moving to a city I loved, was when I met my true friends.  It is hard for everyone, just try to do things you love, even by yourself, and you'll eventually find your people.  It takes time, I'd say 1 year to really feel comfortable calling people to do stuff in a new place, and 3 years to really find your groove, at least that was my experience."

They say that it takes about three years in a new city to really know whether you want to put down roots there or start putting together an escape plan.

He's totally breathtaking.
We have a neighbour who was recently in hospital with cancer for the 2nd time. Tough thing for a 13 year old. It is thoughtful acts like this that make these kids remember they are kids. This brought tears to my eyes. The world needs more people like you sir.

What I want to know is, why is Wally called Waldo in America?

Dang, now he has to be hidden again. Lol
Careful he's a hero
Cancer is always sad, but crushes my heart when kids have to deal with it when they should be just enjoying their youth peacefully.
"My step dad had cancer really bad and went to the VA in California. When shit was really bad and my mom would be having a hard time dealing with his sickness he'd alawys tell her ""don't feel bad for me, I'm an old man. There's little kids right down the road from this hospital that you drive past to get here every day, cry for them. If they can do this then an old man like me can man up and do it too"". Even after all these years that stuck with me. It also gave my mother the strenght to drive over two hours back home too.   Fuck cancer in all of its forms."

She also married the creator of hunter x hunter
Sailor Moon was one of the very first shows that taught me wholesome female empowerment <3 not to mention how extremely ahead-of-its-time it was in regards to sexuality, until America got ahold of it and made the very very lesbian couple into ‚Äúcousins.‚Äù But let‚Äôs be honest. No one believed it. They literally raised a child together.  Oh wow! Knew it wouldn‚Äôt be long before the transphobia joined in
I hope she got the friends she wanted
Well you created girls that we all wanted as friend :#
It‚Äôs so interesting to hear how many people were in low places when their best showed out. Are troubling times necessary for this to happen? How many lose themselves along the way?
As a 6'3, 200lbs man who grew up and currently live in a very masculine environment, which means I never can mention I love sailor moon. Sailor moon has really helped me a lot during hard, lonely times. Few times I was near the breaking point, I listen to moonlight densetsu on repeat.   Naoko will never read this but I believe she has helped so many people around the world like me. Thank you Naoko.

It just warms my heart that she could overcome a bad period in her life by making something so beautiful. It gives me hope for myself.
It's really cute how in one the first volumes in the extra's he thanks her for helping him and then later extra's have a wedding announcement and the birth of their first child.
I'm so glad Togashi found such a wonderful supportive wife. He also did Yu Yu Hakusho!

From what I've heard, she became and remains friends with many of the original voice cast.
Also married the creator of Hunter X Hunter
I think the process of creating something requires a certain amount of self-intimacy, which is itself what allows us to process and grow as a person
She has a degree in chemistry, as she had planned to become a pharmacist if her art career hadn't taken off.
Japanese denim is just so expensive though
She just hasn't got to the braking point yet. https://i.imgur.com/TalVwuy.jpg
Painting, writing, music etc. is a nice way to deal with difficult times, because you can materialise those thoughts and wishes that make you feel better.
I wonder how they‚Äôre doing now. I just know his health has been an issue for a long time, which is why we never got an ending to Hunter x Hunter, so I hope they‚Äôre doing alright.
Sailor Uranus and Neptune, and the child they raised was Sailor Saturn. Not only were they lesbians but Uranus was also genderfluid and went by both male and female pronouns, such as Saturn calling them ‚ÄúPapa‚Äù
Omggg, that is too sweet for my cranky jaded heart to take so early in the morning.
Sooo, the girls she wished were her friends, she created, found people to become them, and then really became friends with them?!

I‚Äôm socially anxious and not good looking
Word of advice from a fellow socially awkward (at times) regular schmoe. It's ok to get rejected, learn to accept and be cool with it. Not everyone will like you back that way and that's just you accepting reality. By accepting it, it stops being something that will feel like the end of the world. I practice by talking to people I'm dealing with, like waiters, baristas, bartenders, stylists. You get used to the flow of conversation and coming up with stuff on the spot. You get used to it and better at it. You realize it's easier to talk to people in general (even ones you're attracted to) without being so awkward about it. And you realize looks only go so far. An average looking person who is confident, can make others laugh and feel good just by talking to them are way more successful, not just with scoring but with people getting in their corner.
See im the opposite im ugly but i can talk to anyone even a wall. The way i uplift myself is saying i was to op and God had to nerf me in order to fit in  Edit: Wow just got done finishing my hw and i see all these replies its makes me really happy to know i helped some people and made people smile üòÅ
Does anyone have an advice for a socially anxious person who wants to meet people ?
Quality meme.
Welcome to the club, friend.
Do you know how many ugly married people there are?  Do you know how many ugly, socially anxious, married people there are?  There's someone for you.
Even Neo failed the jump program.
Yay for both of you :).
Gonna steal that mindset real quick
God nerfed me real hard with depression
Alcohol. Reddit always hates this answer, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best for meeting friends but it‚Äôs very good at making you get used to being more social. Go to a pub with a buddy, get some beers in you and marvel at how easy it is to talk to random strangers
It says ‚Äúattractive‚Äù not ‚Äúgood looking‚Äù
That's so sweet. Thank you. I know I will find my ugly, socially anxious significant other someday. ü•∞
Imagine if Neo ragequit after that jump because the world was against him and he's such a good guy why wouldn't everything he do be successful, it must be the world is wrong, not him   We'd all still be in the matrix unwillingly.

Well I have a friend that keeps asking me that... I may give it a thought, thanks
"Bro this is so true. After a year of trying to get any attention at all, I finally, FINALLY, gave up and just cometely stopped trying to impress women at all. Starting actually saying what I thought and felt, which is, in general, very nerdy. Now I have more attention than I know what to do with.  Several of them have said I'm ""just the right amount of nerdy"""

This is pretty old, but the awesome news is [this resulted in raising over a million dollars for his school.](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_6604722)
Ms. Lopez is shaping the future. 
Still amazes me how educators get paid less than their worth to society (imo).
Photo and interview credit as far as I'm aware: Brandon Stanton www.humansofnewyork.com  I either have complete respect or disgust in people depending on how they treat children. This person seems to be one of those people you'd want to trust with such an important job. 
That's the type of educator I want to be.
Reddit stealing from instagram. And balance was restored in the Universe  Edit: it was meant as a joke since everybody is talking about how instagram steals from reddit. Although I agree that keeping the username makes it completely different.
Because of this Humans of New York post, his class all got to go to DC and meet Obama too. 
This article was such a pleasant read. Awesome story 
Hey Mr. Scott, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do? Make our dreams come true!
Lopez 2020
HONY did a follow up story on Ms. Lopez after this interview. She is incredibly impactful community leader, it was wonderful to see her leadership. Happy this is recirculating!
Unfortunately there are large sections of society that under value the worth of teachers and many other important professions.
Brandon Stanton‚Äôs Humans Of New York is truly inspirational and keeps me going everyday. There‚Äôs so many more interviews he does with people of all ages and outside of New York.  Besides the website, he‚Äôs also on Instagram and Twitter. And there‚Äôs a Facebook Watch series of this. I highly recommend everyone to check it out!
I think we need to stop calling it stealing and just accept that it's the internet. 
This is the kind of beautiful shit the internet can do when we focus on the positives
Suspensions are useless. Tell me, how is not allowing your student to do anything a way of showing him how useful school can be? 
"The phrase ""and those who can't X teach"" drives me nuts.   There are a multitude of things that I can do that I cannot teach to someone else. The ability to distill your knowledge down to the simplest building blocks and be able to rearrange those blocks in many different ways so everyone is able to build with them is an absolutely incredible skill.   "
i love you. have a good day 
"Isn't that phrase supposed to be more about coaches/ players than your standard teachers? For example,  a 50 year old whose body is tired and older, who can't compete with 20 year olds, who once had great skills, now can't ""do"" so that's why they ""teach ""? That's how i've always looked at it. "
i love you too. have a good day
"That's a really kind way to look at it, but no, that's not how it's used. It's used to imply that teachers are all idiots who can't hack it in the ""real world."""
I love all of you, this thread just made my day.
I love you. Hope your day is as beautiful as you are!
They are just taking a break from pawing at the gate and ignoring St. Peter when he opens it.
I‚Äôm not crying, I just got something in my eyes üò¢ I miss my babies
Two minutes after this, they were meowing to be let in again. The angel opened the gates, but the cats changed their minds. 
Omg.,.   So I send my friend at least two wholesome memes from here a day. She likes them. And it encourages me to be positive.   Well, My friend just had a cat die yesterday and she told me she ESPECIALLY needed all the wholesome memes today. This is literally perfect. It‚Äôs so strange how pieces of life come at the right time, just when you need them. 
That made me tear up. I hope my cats are waiting for me too in a good place 
Too pregnant for this today. üò≠ Now an emotional snot factory. 
It's ok Rex, you don't have to wait for me. Go find my big brother and keep him company until I get there. I'll find you guys eventually 
If I got mobbed by all my pets after I died I would be sooooo happy.
Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....   Edit: thank you for the gold kind stranger. 
There is one particular kitten who didn't make it to three weeks... I would love to embrace him again. We did everything we could for little Spike. I planted an Aloe Vera cactus (spiky and healing) when we buried him. <3
That's why they have 9 lives. St Peter just gets pissed the 10th time and doesn't let them back out
Annnnnnd I'm tearing up. God damn you reddit.  Edit: jk St. Peter
My cat is just finicky about who lets him in. If my kids or husband do it, he ignores them half the time. If I get up directly afterward however and call him, he almost always comes in. Warms my heart.
Omg that is just what I needed today too.  I had to put my eldest dog down last Thursday and it's been rough, needless to say.  We got his ashes back this week and I just got an urn necklace today, so I have him next to my heart at all times.    
I needed this so bad. Good job.
Good thinking! 
We had to put down our 14 year old dog two years ago before Christmas, we have his ashes in the living room safe where he can be admire by the whole family. It is rough thinking about not having him no more, but we spoiled him ever since adoption making sure he was happy every single day. 
Opening my eyes, I got to my feet. I was surprised that my paws weren‚Äôt hurting. I wagged my tail and sniffed the air. It smelled like The Park and Our Home. It smelled good here, I liked it a lot.   Yesterday I wasn‚Äôt feeling so good. I had been throwing up and my hips and paws hurt. Even eating grass didn‚Äôt help. My Person had brought me to the Sharp place. I tried to be mad at him, but he seemed really sad about something, so I wagged my tail to try and cheer him up. I didn‚Äôt even notice when the [Sharp Man](https://streamable.com/og0ed)  poked me, as My Person had been rubbing me and saying Good Boy. I never knew what Good Boy meant, but saying it made My Person happy, so I tried to make him say it often. After that, my eyes got heavy and then I couldn‚Äôt remember anything.   I take a look around. There are two paths in front of me. Both go far off into the distance. One is dark and filled with scary things and gives me bad feelings. The other goes to a bright place. There is grass everywhere and lots of other dogs playing around. It felt so welcoming, I took a few steps forward, preparing to head in that direction. That was, until I noticed a small spot of light in the dark place. Looking down, I saw Our Home. My Person was sitting on the Forbidden Chair looking sad. He looked over at the Okay Bed, where I was allowed to sit, and he would shake a bit and his breath would stifle, because he was sad. I made my choice.   I walked into the dark place. I sat there in front of the small window looking into Our Home. There were a lot of scary, evil smelling things around My Person, but he didn‚Äôt seem to notice. He was still looking at the Okay Bed, but his eyes seemed, unfocused and foggy. I try really hard and force myself through the small window, causing me to fall into Our Home. I glanced back and saw that the small window closed behind me. I slowly walk up to My Person. I try to nudge him, but my nose went through his hand. He didn‚Äôt notice me, but the Bad Things noticed him. All around us, they were creeping closer, but when they got to me, the Bad Things stopped. It seemed that they couldn‚Äôt move past me. They slowly retreated, fading back into the background.   I sat there, next to My Person. Weeks, months, and many years went by. He never noticed me, but he would often sit on the Forbidden Chair, next to me, looking at the Okay Bed, and whispering softly‚Ä¶Good Boy.
So since I can only assume this total onslaught of Keanu Reeves content on all social media right now is part of a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at boosting his popularity, let me be clear that I fully support Keanu Reeves for President in 2020.
I didn‚Äôt know about his stillborn child nor about his gf. I did know about River Phoenix. He‚Äôs remarkable to go through all of this tragedy in the public eye and react in a positive way. It makes me think my personal tragedies are tiny in comparison. He is breathtaking.
He is not the hero reddit deserves , he is the hero reddit needs
Wow he's been through so much pain and yet so humble and kind hearted.
You are not alone keanu. We all are here and love you wholeheartedly.
Can we stop parading around the tragedies of the man's life for Karma. As much as it's supposed to be a celebration of him it feels disingenuous, and I'm sure he'd rather move past those than see them plastered next to his face every day on the internet.
I had thought the matrix money he donated was going to the special effects artists because he felt they weren't appropriately compensated and were the major reason the film was so good. Could very well be wrong, just thought I read that somewhere before.   I know he does have a charity he sponsors though.
It seems really shitty to constantly bring up the shittier points in his life when referring to the guy.
2020 final candidates:  (D) Keanu Reeves  (R) Kanye West
I‚Äôd never want a President Reeves. I have no idea what his politics are, but the inherent controversy that *any* president faces by nature of ‚Äúthey make world-changing decisions that someone will always disagree with‚Äù would seriously get in the way of his wholesome image that he‚Äôs spent so long cultivating
Well he and his girlfriend had already broken up when she died two years after their daughter was stillborn, but it's indeed a tragedy.
He has got the attention of most of the internet right now, He‚Äôs been changing the world and we don‚Äôt even know it. Hopefully he can now do more.
He‚Äôs not jaded. That‚Äôs the key difference. People wanna martyr themselves for every little adversity instead of pushing through it. He could have easily given up at any of these but didn‚Äôt.
I don‚Äôt know how many other people could come out so successful and inspirational with his background story. Many of us would give up.
I'm pretty sure you're right, he thought they deserved better pay for the work they did.
I actually want this, not for the politics of it.  But for the story.
Thanks for clarifying. This all happened 20 years ago. It is horrible and it is a tragedy but I don‚Äôt think Keanu wants us to feel bad for him and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs lonely. Judging from the Cyberpunk video I think he wants us to be stoked with life! He does awesome movies, he gets to learn new stuff, he started a motorcycle company that he loves, he gets to travel, he gets to donate to charities that are meaningful. He has wonderful friends and supportive family. If that‚Äôs not a happy life I don‚Äôt know what is!
> right now  Actually, this has been well known, and he has had the internet's attention for a decade now.
A much better story than Bran the Broken
Everyone ***needs*** to not only care for themselves but to love themselves. No one else is going to, if you don't.
r/KeanuBeingAwesome
Nothing compared to right now though. Not even close
I don't know if there is one correct answer, but for me it is showing empathy and kindness.  Once you realize that other people suffer, continue to suffer and perhaps suffer more than you, and that by showing them kindness and support you can help them, not only do you make their life better, but you improve your own.  Making someone else feel loved does wonders for yourself.  Then, when you don't expect it, and you are having a rough go, others will be there for you.
Fucking little shit got a throne for doing shit all. I'm still not over it.
Very true. It's been niche fandom for a looooong time. I'm glad the gen pop is learning how inspiring he is and what a *truly* decent and exceptional human being he is.
Same.  After he explicitly stated that as the 3 eyed raven he could never be in a position of power.  I'm gonna die mad about it.
Dont get me started on the shit
Free folk is leaking out.     I like it.
After googling Matilda and looking at Mara Wilson‚Äôs (Matilda) Wikipedia page, I have come to find out that Ben Shapiro is her cousin. What.
Danny Devito was Matilda‚Äôs father in the movie. I was mindblown when I figured that out.
Aaand was one of the productors for Pulp Fiction
Didn't wake up thinking that a post about Danny Devito would get me choked up today, but here we are.
[Danny Devito is a wholesome dude. Check out the top comment on this tread.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/6vpvoe/til_during_the_filming_of_matilda_danny_devito/dm32bh7/?context=1)
He also plays Frank Reynolds in IASIP and Arnold Schwarzenegger‚Äôs sibling in Twins ‚Äî on which they made A LOT of money.
Danny DeVito *is* a national treasure.
It was slightly jarring that he was the narrator and a major antagonist. Because the narrator was quite kind with respect to Matilda, while the father was decidedly not.
They do not get along
I follow her on twitter because Natalie Wynn and a bunch of other prominent left figures follow her. I‚Äôm ashamed to say I had no idea she was the kid in Matilda until she tweeted about it(I‚Äôve never seen the movie). I‚Äôve always just known her as the left lady who‚Äôs got great takes lol  Edit: I knew she was Ben Shapiro‚Äôs cousin before I knew of her acting career wtf is that lol
Rhea Perlman (Danny Devito's wife) was the mother in the movie as well.   And I mention that because she deserves credit too: Mara lived with her in her house as well (being that Danny Devito is her husband).
This is something I'm not getting about the post and your comment.  How could you not know that if you've seen the movie?  He's a pretty distinctive actor.
So he directed a kid's movie that teaches positive values, as well as being widely regarded as one of the best children's films of all time, and another where a rapist gets his balls blown off with a shotgun.
I remember watching the movie and thought he was an asshole irl.   I now feel like an asshole for assuming this. Danny DeVito is a treasure.
Exactly thought about this comment. Crazy how Schwarzenegger managed to run into it and help.
I can‚Äôt imagine why
"Hahaha just looked up her twitter account and the name is ""Mara 'get rid of the Nazis' Wilson"". Yeah I'll bet.  EDIT: Ben Shapiro is not a Nazi. People who speak out against modern day white supremacists (alias: Nazis) also tend to hate Ben Shapiro. Apologies to everyone who can make connections themselves for having to read this."
She was also the little girl in Mrs. Doubtfire!
I read that as Ron Perlman and was very, very confused.
How weird must it have been to work opposite two repulsive parent characters and then go ‚Äúhome‚Äù with them where I‚Äôm sure they were lovely.
I went through that too, though! My explanation is that I saw the movie a million times when I was a kid, and didn't know who Danny DeVito was. Later on I knew Danny as the dad from Matilda, and eventually as he became more of a legend/meme, I forgot where I knew him originally from. I haven't seen Matilda in over a decade, but still love it. So later on when I learned/remembered it was Danny, it blew my mind.
I feel the rapist getting his balls blown off is teaching children positive values.
To be fair, he plays a lot of assholes.  A testament to his acting ability.
He always seems to be there when you need a post sent to Danny Devito, or when you need the liquid terminator killed
Her mom got cancer because he DESTROYED her with FACTS and LOGIC.
Mara won't send Shapiro photos of AOC's feet.
Come on man, that's a little over the top  *checks*  What do you know, it really is.
He speaks against them while also blowing the racist dog-whistle. He's a racist.
ron perlman and danny devito would be one hell of a power couple
It's his release so he can be wholesome af off-camera.
Frank Reynolds is a Saint
What did Logic do? Spit bars at her?
Not enough magnum condoms for monster dongs to fuel that.
That's the best part, Ben Shapiro doesn't actually know Logic, but he pretends to
> Ben Shapiro  my beloved nephew, just started college, likes this guy.  so far i keep my mouth shut as i do not want to alienate him and have him go over completely to the dark side.
I haven't seen anything about Ben in a long time, why does everyone here seem to hate him?
He doesn't argue so much as he espouses so many different views/topics in one single breath that those inexperienced with debate don't know how to handle all the information flying at them and perform poorly.
As others are suggesting, he's good at debating *like a Republican,* which means yelling, interrupting, and Gish Galloping. He only engages with lesser debators, like college students. He doesn't actually debate the greater liberal political minds, so this selective debating makes him appear smart and capable, while he is in fact like a mediocre NCAA player who pretends he's a pro on social media.   There's a video of him being interviewed by a well known and intelligent british conservative. Shapiro didn't know that last bit and accused him of being a liberal for being critical and analytical about his views. The British guy embarrassed the shit out of him, and serves as a great example of how shitty Ben actually is.  Throw in the radical right views he has and presto, human garbage.
He doesn't always think things through. Such as his stance on [climate change.](https://youtu.be/X9FGRkqUdf8)    [^^^HBomberguy ^^^source.](https://youtu.be/RLqXkYrdmjY)
"Pretty sure ""sophistry"" is an apt description of his style."
Waitressing, I once had two drunk customers hitting on me relentlessly while I was trying to put in orders, I told them to fuck off with out thinking. I relate to this too hard.
This isn't restaurant related but I just spent several days in the hospital and it amazed me how poorly everyone was treating the nurses. I just couldn't understand it, these people are trying to help you and they're just yelling and cursing at them. I felt bad for the staff.
I never insult the staff anywhere. They‚Äôre the employees and I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôve been through. They deserve to be treated nicely.
I got upset at a lady at the ups store because I was doing a return and the company had printed the return label for me but only gave me one when I needed two. Was frustrated and took it out on her. I think I was just having a crappy day on the whole.  I felt terrible, I ended up going back in and apologizing to her
Honestly, I think you shouldn't abuse robots either. If I was on a date and they were cruel to any sort of sentient or non-sentient server that would be a total red flag for me...
Man fuck people who try to take advantage of workers who could very well lose their job just for sticking up for themselves. And kudos to you for actually doing something to these ass hats. How did your manager respond?
If I were your manager I would have had your back.
Most of the times the people who are treating the nurses disrespectfully is in some sort of stress, physical or emotional pain. They are not thinking or acting on the correct mind set.   Think about it when you are stressed even the slightest thing could irritate you.
  Imagine getting underpayed and overworked. Thats how these employees are mostly treated. The least thing you could do is be nice to them.
I couldn‚Äôt believe I said it when I did, the two guys looked shocked and started laughing and were like Hey ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt tell your manager okay‚Äù then started making jokes about how if I was in the USA (it was in Australia, I‚Äôm from the USA)‚Äù you would be fired‚Äù and then just kept saying how they won‚Äôt say anything. Then soon after I saw them walk up and tell my manager. One manager (my favorite manager) was Not happy and just couldn‚Äôt believe I said that and was like ‚Äúwhy would you do that.‚Äù Then he big manager (owner) pulled me aside to get all the info, I was Totally honest and at the end of the day he (and basically every other person that worked there) understood and had my back. But obviously he told me to just not do it again.
I've had friends that worked as waitresses, and just thinking about the shit they had to put up with makes me fucking **livid**. One of the worst things I heard was that they would often not be allowed a single bathroom break during 8+ hour shifts. Some of their coworkers would get kidney stones from waitressing. Its straight up inhumane. My heart goes out to waiters/waitresses.  Edit: I didn't think this comment would get any attention, but since it has, I'd like to say this. Just because this stuff hasn't happened to you or someone you know, doesn't mean that it isn't happening to someone, somewhere. Skepticism is perfectly fine, but in this case there is zero detriment to you or anyone else to put aside your skepticism and consider that what I have said may be true. There's no chance of anything getting better if people are in the dark about it. At the very least, please, please be kind to folks in the service industry. If you know someone with a job like that, perhaps check up on them and see how they're doing. Even if you can't do anything for them directly, just knowing that you care can go a long way!
I thought about that as well, and one guy had a legitimate reason to be upset. His surgery had been cancelled for the 4th time in a row and he was none too happy. The nurse explained that there was nothing she could do about it but he still yelled at her. I understand he was stressed but she didn't deserve that.
Wow, they said they wouldn't tell and then went and told anyway. Exactly the sort of behavior I'd expect from two limp-dicked idiots hitting on someone who is just trying to do their job.
Wow. That‚Äôs just fucking slave labor. No job is worth that abuse, I hope they have healthier job environments now.
Here‚Äôs a fun fact, someone who makes a big deal about ‚ÄúNot telling‚Äù and tries to be buddy-buddy about not telling, they should not be trusted.
You are strong like baby ox  This I like
"I totally relate to this post. I miss the guy who used to own the Chinese restaurant near my work. When we came in he would exclaim ""SPICY GIRL!! O-KAY!"" because he knew I liked my food with extra pepper, and his ""girl"" sounded mostly like ""GRR"" which was even more endearing."
It bothers me that the question is never answered.  Farm?
STRONG POST. FARM?
"Once I lifted an elderly Persian man's heavy baggage onto a belt and swung it onto its side so it'd go up the conveyor, and he shouted ""You're splendid, so strong!"" Honestly, that pretty much made my entire month."
"I used to be a chef, and while I was in training, I lifted a huge, heavy stock pot onto the stove. My uber-German instructor, without missing a beat said, ""Strong girl. Good for breeding."""
"I had a guy tell me I had ""thicc thighs"" and my only response was ""My legs are BIG and STRONG, like BEAR.""   He unmatched me after that."
"""LOOK FERTILE, LIKE SOIL."""
"This is awesome. The last time I tried to wrestle my luggage into the back of a cab the driver stood watching me, shook his head and sighed, ""Women."" I bet you feel like a queen today! A strong, farm queen! Thank you for sharing."
Why speak many word when few word do trick?
Strong women are cool.
"I too have met Janus the cab driver. Janus good man. He say ""Harvey you smart boy, move to Poland, have beautiful European weather and opportunity. See America already have Google so you go and make Polish Google!"""
dwight schrute approves
as a Polish guy i feel joy that one of us made you happy
"When I (tried to) put my luggage into the trunk of a taxi the last time I suddenly realized that I was more tired than I realised and the luggage heavier than expected and said ""Schei√üe"". The driver was English, but he immediately understood and laughed sooo hard. Seemed like watching a tiny Austrian lady trying to lift  her luggage and swearing in German was the funniest thing he saw that day :)"
Guys only want one thing and it‚Äôs disgusting.  A woman who is strong like ox.
So were they correct? FARM??
Read in Borat's voice.
"My uncle worked in a Audi/BMW/Benz garage with some weird Euros. Favorite quote was some mechanic telling a customer ""Car run like baby's ass."" Instead of ""Smooth as a baby's bottom."""
I read this to the voice of heavy from tf2
"This reminds me of the owner of the little Thai restaurant in my town. When I was pregnant, I LOVED their pad kee mao extra spicy. When I would walk through the door, he used to say ""oh! Spicy #61 for double person! Coming right up!"" I guess he didn't know the word ""pregnant"", but I feel like he was still accurate."
"Had a mom/pop Mex place near where I used to live, they called me ""super cilantro"" bc I wanted mounds of it and all their cooks called to me with thick accents when I came in.  Was so cute."
"There's a bit of a hole-in-the-wall Thai restuarant near me and everything is Engrish. The owners are Thai, but the father-in-law is Japanese, they employ him as their waiter and it's the most adorable thing ever. Very little English and he's very quiet.    Their thai peppers are imported from relatives who grow them, so the spiciness varies depending on the harvest. There's a 0-5 spicy scale when ordering and a markerboard with, ""NO REFUND IF TOO SPICY"" written on it.    The girl running the register, I believe the daughter of the owners (and the only native English speaker), is so small she wears children's  Disney shirts and I can't help but be jealous she can do that. I compliment her on the shirts and give her a hard time when she doesn't have a Disney character on her shirt for the day.    I also love them for refusing to accept food-delivery services, you either come in to eat or pick it up yourself, because it's a small operation and they want to keep it that way."
So wholesome
There was a guy that had a small hotdog place a few years ago. They had amazing brats on steamed buns. I went in the first time and ordered two brats plain. As he‚Äôs getting them he verified that I don‚Äôt want anything on them and I confirm. He looked pleased. Then he asked if they were both for me and I said yes. He looked up mid prep and said in a thick New York accent ‚ÄúAlright! I like a woman that can eat and you‚Äôre eatin‚Äô ‚Äòem right!‚Äù Then he gave me a bag of chips and a drink and sent me on my way. Nice to have someone say that when I came in.
City girl.
He asked that question, because women from outside the city tend to be stronger and fiercer. It‚Äôs kind of a stereotype in Eastern Europe, including Poland. And, like most stereotypes, there‚Äôs some truth in it.
GRAIN?
Similarly - I was backpacking across Europe with about 80L across two bags and, as I put them on, some Slovak guy said ‚Äúvery strong girl! you gym?‚Äù It made me feel so confident :)
ESPLENDID!
He‚Äôs saying you are the peak of human evolution and your genes deserve to be passed down several generations. That‚Äôs a hell of a compliment.
I play the tuba (5‚Äô3‚Äù woman). When I was 17, my high school band was invited to Moscow to play in a parade and at several venues, including the Moscow circus. I was backstage carrying my sousaphone, and an old man pointed to me, made a muscle, and said in a thick Russian accent, ‚ÄúStrong! Like Russian Women!‚Äù This was many years ago, and I still remember his smiling eyes as he said it.
I'm German and I'd be weirded out as heck
that‚Äôs...sweet? i think?
FWIW, that's genuinely hilarious. You may have dodged a bullet there, people with little to no sense of humour aren't often very fun to be around.
People always say Parisians are rude/don't like tourists, but I was helped to lug two heavy bags from my year abroad down the subway steps on my way to the airport to fly home.  Also, earlier when I had been catching the train from Switzerland back to Paris, a load of what looked like new conscripts for their army loaded onto the train, taking up all the aisle room.  I was on the top level and when I had to get off, there was no easy way through the crush. One young gent yelled out and got one other to hoik my bags over their heads and take them along the aisle, down the stairs and onto the platform for me.  They all looked very smashing in their new uniforms and I felt very flattered haha.
Sometimes at the gym I'm just in awe by the tiny women who squat with heavier weights than I could even dream of.  Then I remember I shouldn't stare at women squatting since it's creepy. Just know this ladies, sometimes I'm not staring at your butt I'm just really impressed by your strength.
Well what are you waiting for? Go make Polish Google!!
This is the most genuine polish response üíï

‚ÄúDouble person‚Äù hahaha I guess all pregnant women are like Russian nesting dolls in a way...
""" Double person "" should be a common name for pregnant women"
Double person is the greatest description for a pregnant.
I love when foreigners don‚Äôt quite know the word for something but find a great way of expressing it lol. Reminds me of a time a few years ago; I used to work as security for a retail store in a big outlet centre which sees a lot of tourists visit regularly.   Once an Arab guy came in to the store where I was working and, as I was the first person he saw, decided to ask me for help.   ‚ÄúMy friend, please, I am looking for uhhh... how do you say... shorts, but with sleeves, yes? Shorts with sleeves.‚Äù  He was motioning towards his legs as he spoke and obviously meant trousers. I thought it was just...fantastic. I showed him where they were and I always smile when I think back about it (although I obviously didn‚Äôt laugh at the time, so as to not seem rude lol).
ah yes, I too enjoy soap flavored food!

Which is a weird sentiment from a German.
[Strong!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/8c/6b/f38c6bfeb0a3e5fa42f2dd1d9b3ed361.jpg)
"You know the show ""Hell's Kitchen?"" Very much like that. (Actually, the movie ""Burnt"" is the most accurate representation of what it's really like to work in fine dining that I've seen in film). It's fucking brutal, especially for a woman. You need a special kind of narcissism and sociopathy to even remotely function in that world. The industry is also a cesspool of addiction. I was in for 6 years, made it from commis to Chef de Partie de Garde Manger and lost my mind. Complete nervous breakdown and THIS CLOSE to suicide. It seems glamourous, but it's not.  I would also caution STRONGLY against pursuing your passion as a career. 20 years later and I'm still recovering and just starting to enjoy cooking again."
I've said that to other people, if I say it in person, I do a little squat and slap my thighs firmly. Most people think it's hilarious.
I'm going to say everything looks smashing for the rest of the day.  My new favorite word!
You are so wholesome
Issa very nice!
Except you shouldn't rip them open to see what's inside.
"I once mentioned to my London friend how weird the fire brigade sounds compared to where I'm from. I did not know the word, so I said ""anti fire people"", and she still gleefully uses that term both around me and with the rest of her social circle lol."

I was gonna make a pun based off this comment but it doesn‚Äôt make sense in writing and now I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to spell something that sounds like ‚Äújohnyer‚Äù in a way that makes it clear that this is a pun

I‚Äôd call him little prick
No joke. I don't think the barista has ever talked to me beyond the bare minimum.  And frankly I'm alright with that really.  Did have one one time mention how weird the name 'kitchen sink cookie' is. I had to agree.

"It's based on the phrase ""everything and the kitchen sink"".  Basically it had a bunch of stuff mixed in.  Edit:  the phrase is: everything but the kitchen sink"

Talking with friends is a completely different thing then talking with strangers
Thought the one on the right had a fish hook in it at first
People are confusing introversion with being shy/socially anxious.   I'm an introvert. I'll talk to anyone and I'll be a social butterfly at gatherings/parties and often host. But I also do just fine sitting at home reading a book or working on projects. After a big night out I usually need a morning to mentally recharge and don't want to be around people at that time. I don't like group vacations for that reason: I'm socially outgoing but I also need my alone time.  OTOH, I have a friend who is an extrovert. He *needs* to be around other people. He makes far too much money to need a roommate, but he has one because he needs the constant social interaction. He leaves his door unlocked whenever he's at home and always has at least a couple of people over.
I'm an Introvert
Aww, that's really cute
This kind of hanging out gradually turned me into actual extrovert
You're gonna love college
I still see a fish hook, I guess I'm just tired.
"Exactly this. I'm not socially inept. I'm good with parties. But don't mention ""parties"" to me for at least another week or 2 after one.  Your last paragraph also sounds like Hell on Earth to me."
Damn
What do you mean?
It honestly took me 3 tries to see they were drawn on arms so I don‚Äôt blame you
Username checks out ?
"College is like both happening at the same time, all the time.  I am definitely an introvert, but some of the best advice I can give to someone heading off soon is, ""be aggressively friendly, even if you hate it at first. Knock on doors and introduce yourself."" You will like at least one of your floormates.   Also? There are so many introverts at college. So, so many."
Yeah you would be surprised. Talk to classmates, share homework details and study groups if you need something to break the ice.
Introvert LPT: just ask the person what profession they‚Äôre studying for.  Once they stop, just ask a question about it.  Once they stop, ask another question.  Once that well runs dry, ask about their hobby.  Once they finish talking about it, ask a question related to what they said.  Rinse and repeat.  Try to read the room, though.  If they don‚Äôt feel like talking about it, just nod, say ‚Äúneat,‚Äù and play it cool by acting like the awkward silence is totally normal.  Keeping a drink in your hand to take sips from is a great prop to make it seem like you have a reason for not talking much but you still want to hang out with others - it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre thirsty.  This way you can be sociable without having to talk.
Share homework details and study groups but your classmates don't study
How big of a water bottle can I bring to social settings before it looks weird?
If you bring one of those metal water bottles you can act like you‚Äôre drinking from it even when it‚Äôs empty.
My brother is autistic and has no care for babies or animals but for some reason they fucking love him! Like babies always laugh at his death stare towards them and there has been multiple times where wild animals (specifically birds for some reason) have literally just followed him around lmao.
‚Äúnot this man! GET BACK IN THERE TEAR‚Äù     Cmon tell me u get the ref
I guess it might be the right word since no one else has brought it up, but ‚Äòdownsie‚Äô just seems like such a wrong word lol.
Semi-related question: where do we draw the line betwern high and low-functioning down syndrome? I don't think this distinction exists in my native language.
The look on his face in the second pic... to be on the receiving end of so much love... breathtaking
I am a single father with a son that has downs. He is the love of my life. God knew exactly what he was doing when he blessed me with him. At the time he was born I didn‚Äôt know how to react and had so many questions. 15 years later and I wouldn‚Äôt change a single thing.   The love they have is unexplainable.
The second picture is so sweet.  Edit to add: would he be able to qualify for a volunteer program at a nearby hospital to hold babies in the nicu?
As a sib of a brother who has Down syndrome, the word ‚ÄúDownsie‚Äù drives me nuts. I can‚Äôt get past it in the meme. Especially combined with low functioning. Just describe the behavior you need to make people understand he can‚Äôt hold babies.   Sorry, end rant, this guy and the baby are amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è my brother loves hugging on babies.
My best friend has downs and she is by far the most loving, incredible person on this entire earth. They are wonderful, kind, beautiful people who see the good in everyone. We are so lucky to have them in our lives.
Yeah, I'm not sure what causes that. I'm autistic myself and I get the same thing. Kids trust me; animals see me as not-a-threat. Luckily I rather like both children and animals, so I don't get annoyed the way your brother most likely does.  My best guess is this: Autistics like me and your bro usually have a neutral expression on our faces and bodies. We aren't constantly trying to interact, shoving ourselves into other people's lives. We just exist and experience the world around us. So when a small person, or an animal, sees that, they see us as someone who won't attack them or try to dominate them. Cats, especially, see us as very polite because we don't impose ourselves on them. So we're sort of a safe person.  When it comes to actually interacting with kids, I tend to forget they're kids and just talk to them like I would to anyone. Some kids may like that because they feel like I know they are also human and take them seriously. I never saw the point in not taking kids seriously, really; I was perfectly serious about life myself when I was a kid, after all.     Edit: Just wanted to say thanks for the medals! You all made my day! Love to all my autistic sibs out there.
He is a Disney princess.
Cloudy with a chance of meatballs?
It's one of those things that's probably a term of affection from the right people, but could definitely sound insulting from the wrong people.
Seems that way, but I guess seeing as it‚Äôs his brother we‚Äôll give him a pass?
I don't think it's a derogatory term, but it damn sure *sounds* like it. Since it's clearly not intended that way either way, though...
It‚Äôs actually a loving term used by people in the community. It sounds less scary and stigmatizing than Down syndrome
High function can mostly take care of themselves and even hold a job with simple requirements.    Low function can't do those things or at least they need much more supervision than a high functioning.
My sister has mosaic Down‚Äôs Syndrome, which means only some of her cells have trisomy 21 and she doesn‚Äôt exhibit all the typical traits (eg appearance). She‚Äôs a pretty articulate writer, can arrange some transportation for herself, and can make herself a few dishes. I think if she had been brought up with independence as a goal, she could have lived on  her own and maybe had a job. That‚Äôs the high end. Kids with special needs receive tons of assessments, so I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs where it comes up.
There‚Äôs a list of skills needed for independent living/functioning that‚Äôs often used to make these calls for people with developmental or intellectual disabilities.  Often that‚Äôs the assessment that‚Äôs used to make that call.
Those eyes aren't focused cause he's looking at the baby through his heart!
I'm so glad that he is born into the world as your son. The world may be cruel to him but he has you.
Happy Father's Day!! You are so incredible, and the love that YOU have is so amazing!!
"The post says he is ""low functioning"" so i doubt he would qualify :/ definitely worth trying though"
Spoiled milk and discount baby wipes.
Interesting explanation, thanks!
that actually makes a lot of sense!!! my brother hates being the center of attention and prefers to be a fly on the wall just listening to whats going on so he is definitely not an imposing person either. i also think animals love him bc he squeaks a lot (one of his ticks) which sounds similar to the noises our chinchillas always made.
Huzzah! A man of quality
Reminds me of another controversial word I know ü§î
"It's the same as aspie for people with aspbergers. A bunch of people are trying to ""own it"" by using the terms themselves and seeing the positives in it."
He's got the d word pass, and we assume, the r word pass as well. Imagine if his brother was black? So many endorsements...
"I can back this up as someone who has worked in special education. SOME families and individuals have a problem with the term; however, most individuals I have worked with that were high functioning had an opinion along the lines of not liking the term ""syndrome"" because to them there isn't anything ""wrong"" with them, simply different. It takes away that negative word.  Edit: I can't spell."
Yep, there‚Äôs a guy with Down syndrome at my local McDonald‚Äôs
An explanation you should take with a grain of salt. People with autism can be quite different from one another. Some people with autism are gentle with animals and small children, some are not.
Heh, yeah, I try to use my powers for good. Or maybe I just like to pet cats. You'll never know... muahaha...  Ever heard of Dr. Temple Grandin? She made a career out of understanding animals. Became an animal behaviorist, focused on livestock. Autistic AF and lucked out with a savant skill of near-perfect visual-spatial abilities; designed kinder slaughterhouses so the cows don't feel afraid or even know what's coming. Nowadays she does a lot of public speaking, and some research, I think. Some of the disabled students at my school got to meet her when she came to Ohio.
MY N‚Äî
If he was black that might be the most powerful brother in the world
We had one at Walmart as a greeter. Always gave everyone who walked in a high five and I do mean everyone. Hardest working mf in there any day. Till they got rid of the greeters.
Wait, so different people act in different ways and have different temperaments?! No way!  Lol, I'm just messing around üòú it was a good point to make.
IGHTMARE
ana
Honestly, that's the kind of shit that makes my day.  High five just for coming into your store? Fucking right, gimme two!
I know you‚Äôre kidding but the difference being that my son is non verbal and has no interest in babies. He also isn‚Äôt aggressive. Some of the children I work with however would chuck that baby across the fucking room but would say nor emote anything before you handed them your baby.   Difference being typically developing people can say nah I‚Äôm good your baby is ugly.
And they weren't half ass ones either. They were the good stuff. Got so many people to smile and never made a fuss about those who didn't want one.
I just imagined a 7 year old child grabbing a baby and just yeeting it across the classroom lmfao
I hurt for anyone that doesn‚Äôt enjoy a solid high five
I really don't like people touching me, and even I like a good high five.
Finally a person with a sense of style
Maroon seems to be her color. It‚Äôs all over the place
r/streetwear would love that cute track suit and that composition/pose
What is that? Velvet?
A person with a sense of style!
She feeds off of it to extend her lifetime. There's only Maroon 1 left.
John cena‚Äôs phrase is you can‚Äôt see me so it‚Äôs a joke that you can‚Äôt see the grandma because her clothes match the couch
I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable.
Ahhh I see you are a person of *style* as well
Never would have realized that.
Huzzah! Persons of style!
This both breaks and warms my heart at the same time and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it
I‚Äôd like to imagine that Lee, Tolkien, Gygax and Arneson are all getting a pint of the afterlife‚Äôs best ale together.
It‚Äôs easy to say that Stan Lee will love on FOREVER through the franchise that he built up. He was amazingly creative and talented and I‚Äôm glad that we have all that he created to look back on even without him here with us anymore!! 
"I'd like to imagine he showed this to his wife and she was like ""who's Stan Lee?""  So he wrote 'Marvel' on the suitcase and she was like ""ohhh, I get it now"""
Stan Lee: Thanks God. Now I have seen you face to face, I do have one question to ask you?  God: What question?  Stan Lee: Do you guys Excelsior?
This is amazing.
You sumbitches really out here trying to make me cry today huh.
Cool, that‚Äôs a Marshal Ramsey cartoon! He‚Äôs a political cartoonist and commentator here in Mississippi. üòä 
Rest In Peace Stan.  You touched us all
That indeed is true. And he's also not half bad at destroying half of the universe.
"Agreed, of all the ""RIP Stan Lee"" posts I've seen on Reddit today, this is by far my favorite. Excelsior!"
Nothing sad about Stan's death. He was 95. 70 or so of those spent loving the same woman. He was able to co-create some amazing things, and people loved him for that. It's not a time for sadness. It's a time for reflection. 
I want to watch them play DnD together.
We can throw Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams on there too
Go one step further. It started with ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that, sweetheart?‚Äù   Draw the big button.   ‚ÄúStan Lee?‚Äù  *sighs*
God: Every Me-damned day.
God: You've got this hero thing down, haven't you?   Lee: You could say that  God: I've still created the best hero there ever was...... you  Lee: \*blushes
Already with the allegations?
Right? This is the first one I connected with  Awww :(
Was about to say Tolkien is required to DM but then there's the two men themselves...
"Dave Arneson is [the co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.wired.com/2011/09/dave-who-arneson-gameday-celebrates-other-dd-creator/) along with Gygax.  *Arneson had an enormous impact on the evolution of the RPG genre. ""Lots of stuff in the modern gaming landscape can be traced back to what he invented as a game-master starting in '71, years before D&D's release,"" Tavis says. ""Not just specific tropes like clerics who can turn undead, but the whole concept of having an alternate personality in an imagined world whose capability is measured with numbers that get better with experience. When my son trains his Pokemon, or my aunt sends me a request in Farmville, that's all part of Arneson's legacy.""*  He's the reason for so much of what we associate with RPGs."
I frickin love this subreddit man

If I ever become a parent, this is the kind of thing I hope to find out my kid is doing behind my back
Great. Now my face is leaking.....Andddd here come the water works.
I‚Äôm totally the kind of parent who wouldn‚Äôt question it.   My wife would be like ‚Äú2? Why 2? Are you being bullied? Are you getting hungry during the day? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  I would be like ‚Äúalright. 12 sandwiches and 3 gallons of water... whatever you want bro‚Äù
So was this little kid living alone or something while his mom was in the hospital? Wtf.
We need more adults like this kid.
I'm quite surprised she didn't think anything of it. It was a sweet reason this time, but wanting two lunches generally means the kid is being bullied  and having his lunch taken.
When I was in 10th grade, my mom was undergoing chemo (they found pre cancerous cells, so thankfully it was caught really) and a divorce and was depressed af. I was supposed to get free lunch, we were poor, but somehow there was a mix up and I wasn't getting it. I didn't want to stress her out, so I didn't tell her. And there wasn't a lot of food in the house. So I just went without lunch.  Until my best friend noticed that it was a recurring thing. She started sharing her lunch with me, or buying new lunch. For the entire year.
Yea me too.
Yea, not crack
When I was in 6th grade (US) my parents would put money in an account I used for buying lunch. One of my friends wasn‚Äôt as well off and her parents were getting a divorce so her home life was a mess. A new school year started and things were going awful for her, most days of the week she arrived late and without a lunch or money for lunch. At first I just split my lunch with her but then I‚Äôd just buy her a full lunch as well after a few weeks. It wasn‚Äôt everyday but it was pretty often.   Mom got mad when only a few months into the year I came to her saying my lunch account was running low. Got a lecture about being responsible with money and eating right ect. Money was supposed to last me until near the winter break.  I was worried I‚Äôd get in trouble for buying my friend lunch, so I didn‚Äôt tell my mom at first. Went back to splitting my lunch with my friend. Then a neighbor who substitute taught at school caught us splitting lunch and offered to buy my friend lunch thinking she‚Äôd lost or forgotten hers. My friend explained the situation, which the neighbor relayed to my mom later that day mentioning what a good kid I was to my mom.  Mom confronted me and I confessed. My mom was like ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you tell me‚Äù and ended up funding more on the account with the condition that I be responsible and healthy with the items we picked.  It‚Äôs funny when kids think they‚Äôll get in trouble when doing the right thing. Also by the spring semester things had largely settled down for my friend at home and it wasn‚Äôt much of an issue after that.
It's better than fireworks, believe me
It‚Äôs all fun and games until has asks to bring two blankets to his homies house..
OMG. My mom was like your wife and i gotta tell you this shit is the worst. - Why you need that? What's going on? - Ah, just forget about it - Tell me. What is going on? Is something wrong? - Just forget i asked. I realized i don't need it anymore. And then i would basically learn not to ask her about anything, cause kids needs some privacy, and secrets of their own, you know? I can't explain everything to you, because you could think: a)  whatever i'm asking for is just dumb; b) what I'm asking is, for some reason, wrong for you (but not for me apparently); c) want to get involved when i clearly don't want you to. And i gotta tell you this is worst possible action you can take. You do this shit and all my trust I put in you is gone. Just like that. Gone. And you won't rebuild this motherfucker for years, that's for goddamn sure.
He probably was buying cafeteria lunch and told this persons brother that he missed having his mom pack a lunch for him.   Dad is probably still home, some Dads just refuse to pack lunches or don‚Äôt have time in the morning or doesn‚Äôt have time while doing double parent duty and visiting his wife.  Or the brother just thought this would make his friend feel better.
We do. And we need adults to create a society where something like a parent having medical treatment doesn't lead to their kid going without lunch.
Yea, maybe one of their parents are sick
I will expect you to marry that friend
Why do I suddenly feel the urge to buy double glazing?
Only if he steals it from my stash
Who brings a blanket to a friend's house? Just use the rug as a blanket like everybody else.
Or the child knew there was so much going on that he didn‚Äôt want to put extra tasks on anyone.  Like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find something to pack, dad.‚Äù  But then he doesn‚Äôt cause he‚Äôs a kid and the dad is too busy running around keeping everything together to notice.
Who says she's gay tho
Only if he shares
I'm glad to see so many people coming to wholesome conclusions about why the kid was still going to school without lunch. Many comment sections quickly devolve into assuming the worst in people.
Did you read my whole comment?   ‚Äú or doesn‚Äôt have time while doing double parent duty and visiting his wife.‚Äù
Then she‚Äôs the best of friends.
Just be glad that these days she‚Äôs not assumed to be straight and that comment goes both ways ü•∞
Basically it's proving that you're poor enough to qualify (*testing* that you do not have the *means* to pay), as opposed to simply feeding a kid who is hungry and doesn't have a lunch.
Dumbledore time
Your child must be mesmerized when you talk to your wife about the staff meetings at work.
No one:   JK Rowling: ‚ÄúSo anyway, James Breakwell is gay‚Äù
Probably sounds like he's casting up potions
J.K. Rowling didn't say that, you said that. I heard it with my eyes.
I saw it with my ears
I tasted it with my nose.
I sent a similar message to someone on PS3 while playing Red Dead Redemption 1 multiplayer. I kept killing this one player because I was just messing around in the game world and was sent a message by them asking if I could please stop because they were trying to get a trophy. I immediately felt bad and stopped and then began protecting them from any other players who were trying to kill them.  Edit: thank you for my first gold!
I once received a message in Dead By Daylight that said: ‚ÄúIf it looked like I was teabagging you, it‚Äôs because I was.‚Äù
This man deserves a medal
I once got a message after a really fun free for all round in Destiny where two of us were going toe to toe while decimating the rest of the opponents.  He was a little better than me and had an MLG gamertag.  I was like great here comes the shit talking.  But no, he messaged me to say the round was a total blast and thanked me.
That's fucking adorable
And we thought gentlemen don't exist anymore.
"I once got a message of a really close game where it was basically me and 1 other guy going at it and he ended up winning but messaged me saying ""sorry about your teammates"" even though his were also really bad. We ended being friends a few weeks later after playing with each other."
I am so proud of this community
This is a genuine person irl too i bet
You sir turned from a Grim Reaper to a Guardian Angel real quick
did they get the trophy? I hope so!
I wish I could put a big sign over my head in Red Dead that says ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt shoot me, I‚Äôm not that good at games and I just like to run around‚Äù I can‚Äôt play the multiplayer version (the only version where you can be a girl) because I always just get obliterated immediately, over and over
They had us
I have one that was less funny, but I still feel kind of proud of for coming up with, to a degree. This one guy killed all my friends but I just barely escaped through the hatch, and survived the match. After the round ended, I messaged him saying: ‚ÄúYou missed a spot bitch lol‚Äù.   I thought it was funny at the time.
*carefully, he‚Äôs a hero.*
M: Major   L:League    G;Genuine
I found a guy in the Dark Zone in The Division who actually wanted to cooperate and get loot together, which was rare.  No mics.  We were doing good but at one point had to run away from some other guys.  I thought we got separated and I turned around and some dude was chasing me.  Without hesitation I unloaded into him and killed him.  But it turns out it wasn't somebody chasing me.  It was my coop buddy and I gunned him down in cold blood.  Was a long time ago and I still think about it to this day.
Sorry for murderer ing you
Hopefully he is not the last of its kind.
How long have you been married?
I‚Äôd assume, I mean he went out of his way to tell the guy he‚Äôs sorry about T‚Äôbagging.  That‚Äôs a gentleman.

Not sure, I had to get off at a certain point. I just hope I made them feel better. Edit: as in getting off the PS3. Lol

He has a podcast now! Levar Burton Reads - which is exactly what it sounds like, him reading a bunch of stories to you.
"""I told Pierce a thousand times, I never wanted to meet LeVar in person! I just wanted a picture. You can't disappoint a picture!"""

My happiest memories in elementary school are singing along to the reading rainbow theme song with my classmates.  When the teacher wheeled in the big tv and turned down the lights you knew it was going to be a good day.
# I WISH I WAS LEVAR BURTON
Dude's legitimately in the same vein with Fred Rogers and Bob Ross. 
Geordi Laforge will live forever, most likely
Oh hey I didn't know it was his birthday! I was just reading about a park in Sacramento that's gonna be named after him!  >Sacramento Park's Commission will rename Richfield Park in Meadowville to LeVar Burton Park.  >Richfield Park, three acres in total, was recently upgraded by the city. It features a nature-themed playground, fitness stations, basketball courts, a picnic area with shade canopy, and a turf amphitheater.  >‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always been proud of his Sacramento roots and he continues to use his career and his influence to be a strong advocate for literacy for children,‚Äù said¬†Brianna Moland, an assistant planner for the city.  >In response to the news, Burton said, ‚ÄúWow, is all I can say as well!‚Äù
I TOLD PIERCE I ONLY WANTED A PICTURE OF LEVAR BURTON! YOU CAN'T DISAPPOINT A PICTURE!
It was LeVar Burton that convinced me, a young white man, that systematic racism was still a problem in this country. I saw an interview with him on a major news network where he said if he ever gets pulled over by the cops he goes the extra mile by putting both hands out the window and placing them palm down on the outside of the door, just to make the cop extra comfortable.  I was like hell, if this guy of all people has to worry about this sort of thing, then there must really be something to it.
He also narrated *The Good Neighbor: The Life and Works of Fred Rogers*. That's right, you can listen to this man narrate Mister Roger's life

That's why I like to live near successful dealers in stolen goods. Good fences make good neighbors.
Dude there are two kinds of Romanian people: fucking assholes and awesome people. There's no in between
"That is an awesome story. Thank you for sharing.  The proverb quoted ('good fences make good neighbors' (or in this case, 'good neighbors make good fences')) is questioned in ""The Mending Wall"" by the often misunderstood Robert Frost.   None of which has anything to do with your heartwarming story but if you want some Americana exploration of boundaries and relationships, Bobby Frosty has your back."
"""Were going to build a wall......and ask nothing in return"" :)"
Sharing a beer is a nice thing.
"Our Mexican neighbor who speaks very little English comes over with tequila whenever he sees my husband and I sitting around on our front porch. At our last neighborhood cookout, he taught my son how to play part of ""Michelle"" on his guitar. Then he played it and I sang. Every Christmas, his wife brings over tamales. He's apparently fond of my peanut butter cookies. Dang these Mexicans, invading our neighborhoods and......making us food...and teaching good American kids....guitar...and... sharing their dangerously... smooth tequila. "
They probably got sick of looking at her broke ass fence.
This is exactly why I just bought a sabre sword. Good fencers make good neighbors.
i think successful dealers in stolen goods is the most wholesome and true way i've seen a foreigner describe us.
I am romanian and you don't realise how true this is
And vampires, don‚Äôt forget vampires 
Its funny you said that, I have 2 Romanian neighbors one is the nicest guy I've ever met, for example I've seen him do this twice if he sees you bringing in groceries or something he will run down stairs and hold the door for you and help you carry them in, the other one is so evil she gives me chills when I walk by her
As a romanian, I'm surprised a romanian refused a beer.
And you can use it in de-fence of your property
Multumesc, my friend.
I used to know a Romanian boy in my childhood. He was a good guy. I don't know that I've known any other Romanian people, so it's 1-0 for the good guys over here.
I am from Transylvania (count Dracula's place) and I am a vampire. I'll suck your blood and your cock (NO HOMO)
I use mine to help with defenestration 
Cu placere, my friend
Mi foame, Bunica!
Romanian looks so fancy. I love you, you forgotten Romance language.

Okay, this is adorable.

The whole idea that people should be stuck in the trends of their youth dooms them to be people who complain about LED light bulbs and electric cars. Fuck, I just hit my 30's and I found myself realizing my Spotify was all music from when I was a teenager and I was complaining about Post Malone being pushed by the algorithm . Fuck that, gotta keep my mind open because once it closes it's all downhill.

Well technically they‚Äôre both rocking Nike‚Äôs.   Grandma has a pair of Jordan 1 Homage to Homes, about $500 resale.   Gramps, on the other hand, is rocking a pair of Off-White x Nike Prestos, about $2,500 resale.   Gramps stuntin‚Äô on errebody.  Edit: I stand corrected, I thought I saw some white making them H2H and Grandma but they look like Breds, still about same price resale. Gramps still stuntin‚Äô tho.

> we'll probably be able to adapt to the climate crisis and find ways to live with it.    If you pay attention to the actual scientists, and not the pundits that's literally what is being worked at right now.  It's already changing, reversing isn't currently an option, so putting the breaks on and finding ways to adapt to it is the only things we can focus on.
Whatever position your hands go into when your arthritis acts up.
Had a gay guy ask me to make out once. I'm as straight as they come and said no politely, but it made me feel good. No girl has ever just walked up to me and asked to make out.
Was complimented by a gay guy once. Was later told by some female friends i should take that as a double compliment.
Please don‚Äôt eat your son
These are jokes from Comedian Mark Normand. I'm all about being wholesome, but it isn't wholesome to not credit the person who came up with the original joke
Had a gay guy hit on me in a club, and it was the most flattering while vaguely confusing moment of my life
Used to work as a bartender for a nightclub and we once hosted a gay pride after party - never in my life have I been hit on more in such a short space of time. I‚Äôm straight but it sure was a nice confidence boost!
It‚Äôs happened to me 3 times and my parents are extremely christian
I would just take the money to an exchange lol
These jokes are from a cool comedian. I just can't remember the name
Going to a surprise gay bar when you're a good looking straight guy is like getting rained on. You're like wtf but damn is it refreshing. Credit to Mark Normand, great comedian, deserves credit.
Happened to me a month ago. This guy at the bar was hitting on me and told me I was a beefy Chris Evans (despite the fact that I am more like a P&R Chris Pratt).   Then this guys lady friend turned to him and said ‚Äúleave him alone he‚Äôs not gay.‚Äù So I said ‚ÄúNo I am not, but that is the nicest compliment I have ever received. Thanks and have a good night‚Äù
Only gonna say this once with my throwaway account. I once was at a bar, more drunk than I usually get these days. Was having a fight with my gf actually and it was our first big fight.   I walk into the bathroom and a guy quickly rushes in behind me. He shuts the door.  And he locks it. Was a one person bathroom. I was able to follow pretty quickly where his mind was at and the locking of the door definitely made me nervous...  He has this light grin on his face (an ‚ÄòI shouldn‚Äôt be doing this kind of grin‚Äô) and you can tell he‚Äôs pretty nervous. He gets closer to me, gets on his knees, and he asks if he can suck me off.   I was shocked, but I wasn‚Äôt angry. I just never had been in that position before and I felt honestly like prey, but I didn‚Äôt think I was in danger at least. He was a little pushy but I politely said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not me man, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and told him best of luck and that I‚Äôm not upset.  Definitely won‚Äôt forget that experience. And now I know how some women probably feel at bars....
I had a gay coworker compliment and hit on me once. It still boosts my ego when I think about it lol
Definitely!!
Thanks, Saturn.
Was looking for this comment. It is wholesome and great, but the comments are stolen jokes. Hopefully OP will notice and give credit in a comment or something of the sort.   Mark Normand is too wholesome of an individual for this.
Man, I wish anyone would hit on me.
How often did women at the nightclub hit on you during other days of the year?  I've heard from bartender guy friends that women see them as 'safe' to hit on.
You‚Äôre overextending the metaphor here
Mark Normand, great comedian
Rained on, but on a hot day
So, what is a surprise gay bar?
Hey, I'm not gay, but you make me feel beautiful and loved and I might give you a little handy under the table.
I swear, guys are like compliment camels. We can take one compliment and hold on to it for months. I feel like a compliment from a gay guy would last me a year.
I still see that painting in nightmares. So terrifying.
Hey, DeadArtist617 you looking fiiine today üòéüëâüèΩ
or... is he? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Sounds pretty steamy tbh.
Going to a gay bar without realise that it is, not that it makes a difference :)
When you're a guy and your female friends want to go out to a bar for someone's birthday and you're invited.  Surprise. It's a gay bar.
Wait a minute... ü§î
It‚Äôs probably because we don‚Äôt receive that many of them
> compliment camels   I'm using this later lol  But yeah, we hold on to them because we don't receive them often. Also, the being hit on was nice. I don't think I've ever been approached like that by a woman in my whole life.
With so little compliment sources, you have to learn to hold on to the ones you get. Its honestly kind of depressing.
Thank you, this made my day.
Tastes salty.
"Aw man... I hate these groups of straight girls going ""WOOOOHHH!"" and ""YAAASS!"" in gay bars. They often see queer people as an entertainment for the evening :("
But one of those friends is Kristen Wiig and she spoils the surprise.. she's just too freakin excited.
"I have had one female compliment, it was ""I like the way you wear you pants"" best believe ima always wear Levi's forever."

Hey guys, peter griffin here to explain the joke. So basically, the kid in the pictures looks adorable in the magikarp costume, so the fact that they could come back 20 years later as a gyarados would be pretty funny.
This kid is being eaten by a magikarp, GO GET SOME HELP OMG
Is that John barrowman?
And that buff Gyarados will be posing with an 80 year old John Barrowman who still looks like he's in his 30's.
Redditors in their 40s: Hey Larry! Remember this from way back before the crash of '25?
Isn‚Äôt he always? Love that man.
Hey Peter! You forgot to explain the fact that Magikarp evolves into Gyarados at Lvl. 20, which is why he would come back later in 20 years!
Biff, is that you?
I'd hit him with a Splash attack, if you know what I mean
Is this BTTF?
It sure is Larry, now shut up and get in the hovercar, we're going to miss the Friends Remastered rerun

I really needed to read this right now
"Thank you so much for stating this! It's crazy how often people think that an indulgent lifestyle isn't selfish because it's ""self care"". For me, as a mother, I think about the care I offer my child as a guide for how to take care of myself. The ""treat yourself like a toddler"" rule is a great one. If my child is sad, I don't say, ""Sure, stay up all night and watch Netflix because I love you.""  Instead, I say, ""Your fatigue is contributing to your sadness, so let's get you to bed, even though you don't want to."" Most humans need the same stuff to be happy :)"

You have no idea how much I needed this today. Thank you so much, OP.
I‚Äôm at 301 days since I quit drinking. I have lost 42 pounds. But I need to amp up the exercise now.  Ugh
Getting up and going and doing a real workout no matter how sore my legs/arms/abs are after.
I've been struggling this whole year with anxiety , money , depression, living alone for the first time and a negative self image. After a stranger on Reddit sent me a book and even a little financial help for my birthday I'm going to dedicate these last 102 days to working on being me. I hope everyone can succeed in doing their goals as well! üòÄ
Huh,  this is actually really cool,  and something I needed to hear today.  My self loathing's been a real bitch and I think this might help.   It reminds me of the Japanese art of Kintisugi.  The Japanese have a well known and centuries old art of taking damaged pottery and filling in the cracks with lacquered gold,  silver,  or platinum.  You get some absolutely stunning pieces and they often come out even more unique and durable than before.  It's been a hugely useful metaphor for recovery for me.  No matter how deep my wounds,  how fucked up I was in the past,  I can heal,  and find ways to use those wounds to make myself better.    I can be wiser,  better,  and perhaps I can prevent someone from doing all the stupid shit I did.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi)
Yep. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt sacrifice for what you want, what you want becomes the sacrifice.‚Äù
Hey man, I‚Äôm doing the same thing! I‚Äôm halfway through and I still get scared time to time from the uncertainty and ‚Äúam I doing the right thing?‚Äù But then I remember why I started.   We got this! Best of luck!
I love this mindset! I will try to start implementing the same thought process. Especially about the going to work one...
This reminds me of a quote I tell my coworkers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to, or need to, but I GET to‚Äù.
Is your dad my dad?  My dad always said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a problem until it‚Äôs a problem‚Äù   In other words, don‚Äôt worry about potential problems until they are real and live in the moment right now. Sounds like our dads have some sage advice.
Call the police, explain the situation, and ask for a police escort to get your stuff.
Congrats to you!  Some people might not understand it...but that‚Äôs okay.  Sometimes these small tasks are huge mountains for people.  I have suffered from anxiety issues for the last decade.  I can totally relate to using your partner as a crutch.  I got so bad that sometimes I couldn‚Äôt even go check my mailbox or answer the door.  Those first few times forcing myself to check the mailbox felt like I was climbing a mountain.  But it‚Äôs baby steps.  I‚Äôd say that you being able to go get coffee across town by yourself is wonderful.  I myself wouldn‚Äôt even be able to push myself that much right now.  Celebrate those victories for yourself.  I have found that with anxiety, you need to reenforce the positives as much as possible.  Because your anxiety brain will focus on the negative anyways.  So you go on with your bad self!!!!  Lol
Be careful that you're not the one always calling others toxic for every little thing you don't like, or disagree with, because it might be you yourself that is the toxic one.
Preach.  I cut ties with one of my oldest friends this year, whilst living in the same house as him, for these exact reasons.  He could not see the role he was playing in our friendship 'game', as I like to refer to it.  But recognising how others behold you is tricky, and can often leave one feeling quite empty and used.  But it is your life and only you can make something of it. Don't spend years in co-dependent friendships that are not built on respect.
If you notice yourself often feeling kinda bad after talking to a specific friend, that might be a toxic friendship. And it's totally okay to end the friendship.
Been having thoughts of self harm and suicide lately. Thank you for this. 
Wow, that was a really heartwarming read. Good on you, seriously. Hope this positive relationship between you two gets to last for a long time to come.
It is nice that you are turning it around - but you have a lot of work to do. This isn‚Äôt about you, it‚Äôs about her. You actively abused her to the point she was begging your parents to keep some distance on her day. I don‚Äôt know about every 12 year old girl, but that isn‚Äôt easy. I can‚Äôt imagine what she‚Äôs already gone through.   If you aren‚Äôt making sure she is safe and loved and happy for the rest of both your lives, you‚Äôve failed.
Thanks :) The more I think about it, the cooler it becomes that she wrote a letter instead of just telling me in person. I'm going to keep it in my wallet or something and read it occasionally when I'm feeling sad or probably more importantly, mean.
Hey buddy, on behalf of Riot I commend you for pushing yourself to be a better person and focusing on what is important! I myself had to learn self control in college and forswore MMO's after Everquest had me staying up to all hours of the night and blowing off classes... I eventually played WoW but did so with considerably better self restraint.  Wherever your life takes you, whether it is back to LoL, on to other games, or too much other stuff for video games at all, I wish you the best :)
Hell, I knew a guy who quit EQ just before college and sold his EQ accounts to *pay for all of college*.
DON'T SAY THAT
I had a friend who sold his Runescape gold to buy a car... and another who sold one of his accounts for $500.   It's amazing how people will buy game accounts to avoid playing most of the game.
Karma for breaking the T.O.S. you bastard.
I like your style.  and by style I mean pot.
I just read recently about a guy who would sell runescape accounts/gold for bitcoins and holy shit did he step in it now that theyre worth 1k a piece. 
"THAT was a wise investment of magic internet dragons for magic internet money!  Edit: obligatory ""wow! my first gold! Thanks random internet stranger!"" Now to see what this gold is all about..."
Fords don't float.

i notice you start getting more paranoid and jaded at the world after viewing these.
Mihaly Cziksentmihaly‚Äôs book Flow argues that the secret to happiness lies in moving beyond both boredom and anxiety towards a flow state through adjusting youre challenge level. If you are bored you are not challenging yourself enough and if you are anxious your skill level is night high enough for the challenge.
Never take social media serious.. It‚Äôs for entertainment purposes

"Start with asking yourself questions:  ""Why do I care about this?""   ""What will happen if I let it go?""   ""Is this really mine to control?""   ""What's the worst that can happen?""    It also helps to break things down to the lowest point:  ""What would happen if I didn't go to the party?""  ...people might be upset with me  ""If they get upset, what will happen?""  ...they may not talk to me  ""Do they have my best interest in mind if they stop talking to me over this?""   ...no  ""Am I responsible for making others happy?""  ...no    I hope that helps!"
Sometimes, drunk girls are the best humans.
Drunk girl ftw
My biggest realization in life was that there is actually no one there waiting for you and that if you want friends you actually have to work your ass off as if you are in a relationship, but without the love factor in it.
Thank you friend. I desperately need a friend. I just quit drinking 95 days ago & mine went poof. I‚Äôm fighting a war on a massive flea infestation in my house. It‚Äôs my fault & I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything wrong! My bed is covered in layers of TOO MUCH diatomaceous Earth & it‚Äôs making my tiny chihuahua sick. I have sprayed, bombed, sprayed, vacuumed & I was trying to do the right thing. My girl is ten years old & has a collapsed Trachea. The dust is bothering her. My problems seem insurmountable & all my Mother can say is find the lord again. Good grief. I can do this right? I can do this & my dog will be ok. I‚Äôm crying as I type but just bc I can tell someone who might care. Thank you & I hope you have a day as beautiful as you are. To everyone else, I‚Äôm sorry to post this...I‚Äôm just so overwhelmed & alone.
Alcohol, for me, it's the darkest drug, it messes with your mind in a really fucked up way. Try to change your lifestyle, keep busy doing what you like and of course give some quality time to yourself. Learn to adjust yourself. At the end, No one is having a good time nowadays,therefore, we have to make the best of each day. Keep Fighting. Our worse enemy is inside ourselves.
Well said. If 18 year-old me had heard this instead of ‚Äúget a job you love, and you‚Äôll never have to work a day in your life,‚Äù then perhaps I would‚Äôve thought twice about a degree in art.
Now you have an anniversary to look forward to. 2 August can be a celebration the rest of your life.
Wow. You just made my week!  I was seriously in the dump heading for darker places,but your story touched me in a better,deeper place. Thank you. Keep doing,achieving healing,giving .....huge hugs!!!
You deserve to brag. You succeeded when many people would have thrown in the towel :) 
Just dropping in to say I find you very handsome. Hopefully this experience gave you some confidence. It‚Äôs incredible you went through with it! Best of luck! 
It‚Äôs a matter of perspective.   You‚Äôve put your entire life into a checklist where You won‚Äôt let yourself be happy unless you hit those boxes.  The fact you looked to start your own business is a big undertaking and shows risk taking. The fact that you‚Äôre still here and you learned from it? Resilience.   Take what you‚Äôve learned and apply it now! Meeting new and interesting people is all about risk taking and resilience. Women aren‚Äôt any exception to that.   Where ever you are, that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre at. Find the beauty and let it reel you in.
I agree that when you are younger you definitely have a lot more time to experiment, test things out and gain all the experiences that you need.  However, you life is your life and the choices you made are the ones that you were meant to. 20's, 30's, 40's, these are all just numbers and you can do whatever you want, at whatever age you are. Just because you are reaching 30 and you have not experienced the things you wanted to, does not mean you cannot do them tomorrow and gain them in a way that you enjoy.  This is all coming from someone who is the same age as you but did have the travel experiences, did have the love experiences, did have the friend experiences and the moving to the big new city experiences. I had all of these and I did get a lot out of them BUT I can also look to other people who did more than me and wish I had that level of opportunity and suddenly all of my past seems wasted. Sound familiar?  The point is, the grass is always greener and it is never to late to do the things you want and gain the experiences you desire. It is a mindset that your  20's are the best time for you to do this because you control your actions, not the amount of times you have gone around the sun. It all comes down to you, one day just taking the step to become better. We all can do this, whenever we need to. You just need to commit and allow discipline and momentum to keep pushing you forward.
Can confirm the above, I am a woman and almost in an identical predicament except that I have dated and been intimate with men. I even started my own business like you and failed.  I am also a musician too and have social anxiety and get scared I‚Äôm going to mess up on stage.   I think the dating thing takes a tonne of effort and is scary as fuck and when you interact with those people you find attractive, you may also find that you don‚Äôt have that much in common and they aren‚Äôt as intimidating as you once thought. I‚Äôve learnt to not put people on a pedestal and not develop a connection in my head to their looks. Looks are nice and being attracted to someone is nice but if there is no conversation or connection then I force myself to see only that.   There are people in this world that will make a million mistakes and do one thing right and only focus on that one right thing and there are people that do a million things right and make one mistake and only focus on that one mistake, I think you and I are the latter. You‚Äôre doing okay OP and you shouldn‚Äôt beat yourself up so much.
My mom always says that you have to love yourself before someone loves you, and I‚Äôve found that to be true in my own life. Dating and relationships are hard as hell, especially if you‚Äôre getting in your own way due to low self-esteem etc. I don‚Äôt know how old you are but it wasn‚Äôt until my late 20s that I started having quality relationships, and a lot of that had to do with me finally developing a little self-confidence and self-awareness.   Good for you for taking steps to improve your mental outlook! Here‚Äôs hoping the perfect person for you is right around the corner!
I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre doing better and feeling more confident! We‚Äôre in your cheering section, and good luck for here on out!!! 
It's so sexy to me when men talk about or show that they are committed to self-care.   Seriously, confidence but also beinf vulnerable is so attractive. Good on you for taking those steps for yourself.
Life absolutely is a physical performance. Sitting at a desk for 8 hours straight is a physical performance. Standing up all day working retail is a physical performance. And unlike athletes, we don't get a 9 month off-season.      People need to adopt this frame and take physical training and recovery seriously.
Awesome! I hope you had an amazing day!
You walk like this is your first time in a human vehicle.
This is so cute; I can see the excitement in your steps as you get closer! Hope y‚Äôall had an amazing time. I‚Äôm sure he was thinking he‚Äôd have liked you to have been there and getting to seeing you must‚Äôve put him over the moon.
My dad wouldn‚Äôt even realize I was gone haha that‚Äôs so cool man. What a great video
Thank you! It was great and the next day we relaxed on a boat so it was a perfect weekend :)
Reasons I was nervous:  1. I was surprising my dad 2. It was my first time piloting my new flesh body
Thank you for the kind comment üíõ I could barely contain my excitement!
Thank you!  I‚Äôm an only child so I think that might help a little üòÇ
"The dad at the end.  ""Oh my god!""  So sweet.     But surely the mom can't be about to be a grandma.  She was clearly a teen in the 80s.  And never let go!  But that's just a bit older than me.  I became a teen in 1990."
The moms are always so much faster at getting it than the dads in these videos lol
I love how he was indignant for a second.   'You're pregnant? You didn't say that!'
"So sweet üíï Always kind of makes me sad when I see these videos though, reminds of the broken look on my fathers face when I told him I was pregnant followed by, ""oh no."" Some wounds never heal."
I am such a sucker for these videos. His OMG killed me.
Why does the grandma look like a 28 year old that just flew in from the 80s.
Hahaha while it was very sweet when he exclaimed ‚ÄúOh my god!‚Äù with so much emotion part of me also hears  it as pure panic which made me laugh. I know it‚Äôs only joy but... I cracked myself up.
It‚Äôs cause that‚Äôs all they‚Äôre ever thinking about...grand babies
Maybe it's because they've been in similar positions before and know how to immediately respond?
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say that‚Äù absolutely killed me üòÇ
I can only imagine that you‚Äôll have such an excited and wonderful reaction to when your own child tells you that you‚Äôre going to be a grandparent!
Context: The Grandfather lives in Germany and the Mother and her child live in the US, due to the Grandfathers health problems he can't fly, so the mother and child surprised him
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3oKn8mzNV5U&utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app  With sound.  Edit: thank you u/bycats75 for the silver!
If that was my grandpa, this video would have had a naked old man in it.   Always call first.
Ah he is so happy. The joy in his eyes made my day. I miss my granddad.
I can't fly either
‚ÄúI was just thinking about you‚Äù üò≠
Me either, I didn't know this was a health problem!
The skilful scanning of the medical bracelet to clock his meds by the nurse is so impressive, doesn‚Äôt interrupt the moment but doesn‚Äôt leave idle her other patients time. Definitely deserves a raise
There are few things more beautiful than your children. One of them is your children succeeding, one of them is being good people, and one of them is them loving you. They‚Äôre both beautiful.
i wish that dad's illness is a temporal illness nd he can see his daughter for many more years. I have a daughter and this video hit me hard.
Nurses often only have a set amount of time when they can do a med pass so they only have a few minutes per patient so they have to make it work.
That was pretty badass of her
Now I‚Äôm crying
Sweetest thing ever.. have no recordings of my mom‚Äôs voice at all.
I had a voicemail from my late grandfather who I considered a dad. I kept it on a old BlackBerry. It ended up getting stolen...one of the saddest days in my life.
I am obsessively keeping all of my mom's voicemails to me. My dad died a few years ago and I had only one voicemail from him that I found I hadn't deleted and it was a pocket dial so he didn't say anything and it fucking killed me.
Yep. I‚Äôd give anything to hear my mom‚Äôs voice again. Been almost 15 years and I worry I‚Äôm forgetting it. Crushingly sad.
Awww the puppy gave him lil face licks, so cute
I AM EMOTIONAL *flips table*
when the puppy starts licking his face... omg
I like how the puppy at first is just like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt get what i did right but okay‚Äù 
"Very sweet, but as the dad of a 17 year old ""puppy"", I hope nobody gets me another dog when my Sammy passes away. I know it comes from a place of love, but I'll know when or even if I'm ready to have another buddy and I would want to pick one that I felt was ""right"", not anyone else.   Sammy was 15 when we rescued him (or the other way around). I'd prefer to save another senior and I'd want to make the choice myself."
Damn it, making me cry at the office. Not cool. 
Crying with him. 
And ear nibbles...
My dad would know how you feel. Never say never, although I definitely get wanting to pick your own buddy.  We got a beagle when I was 5, who lived to be 13 years old. My dad never really gets emotional, he‚Äôs not into all that, but his love for animals is a different kind. My parents and I took her to the vet to euthanize her when she was no longer able to stand up. She‚Äôd already been urine incontinent for a bit. The only other time I‚Äôd seen my dad cry that hard was when his own father passed. He buried her in our back yard absolutely sobbing as he lowered her body into the whole. That moment is burned into my brain. He swore he‚Äôd never get another dog again, didn‚Äôt want one. Didn‚Äôt want to feel that pain again.   About 2 years later, I saw a rescue shelter post that they had a lab mix liter for adoption. To this day I‚Äôm not really sure why I felt so pushed to submit an application for a puppy, but I did and I was pretty persistent about our interest. We got approved to come pick out our 8 week old pup. Only my mom and I went, because my dad was so extremely against this idea. He was hoping we wouldn‚Äôt *actually* come back with one.   Well, we did. We picked out a chunky brown boy and named him Winston. When we walked through the door with him, I swear my dad could have killed us. He didn‚Äôt talk for the rest of the day, and he pretended like our new puppy wasn‚Äôt even there.   It took a couple weeks, but my dad began to warm up to our new boy. Fast forward 5 years, and I don‚Äôt think my dad has ever loved a dog more. Since our beagle was purebred, there wasn‚Äôt a lot we could do with her off the leash without her bolting to follow a trail. Our Winston is much more laid back, and loves to just follow my dad around outside. My dad even takes him on leisurely walks through the woods, something we could never do with our Beagle. I‚Äôve since moved out, and unfortunately my mom left my dad, but Winston stayed at the house with dad, because there‚Äôs no separating them now. Winston even barks at my dad when it‚Äôs time to go to bed. He‚Äôs one of the most charismatic dogs I‚Äôve ever met.   I utterly hate to think about the day my dad will have to say goodbye to him. It will surely be harder than the loss of our first family dog. It probably gets harder every time, if I had to guess. I know when that time comes my dad will probably hate me for being the one who introduced him to the vulnerability again, but I won‚Äôt be sorry for the years of happiness and love his companion brought him.   Getting another dog doesn‚Äôt have to be considered ‚Äúreplacing‚Äù your beloved past dog, although it sure feels that way. The way I always try to think of it is that your dog would probably want you to love another the same way you spoiled and loved them.   
Establishing dominance right away
aw you can tell she loves him so so much
I‚Äôm a dad of a two-year-old and randomly have been really teary today thinking about how much my daughter means to me. Probably had to do with reading her Stellaluna (try and do that without crying, I dare you) and a couple truly beautiful posts on this sub. You guys are the best.
I almost cried yesterday morning. Worked my overnight shift and I put the key in the door, I hear my 6 year old daughter yelling ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs home daddy‚Äôs home‚Äù and when I got in she gave me the biggest hug. Said, what you doing up so early?  She told me she was waiting for me to get home. I love my daughter.

So much love all around
Happens to me all the time.  Or any time of day I'll randomly daydream of something horrible happening to my little girl and find myself crying and sometime ugly crying out of the blue.  And I'm not a cryer.  Girls are the best.
"Before you project your bs onto the daughter, mom, or father, this is what she has to say about it.      Original vid is titled ‚ÄúCleared my daddy child support balance after he‚Äôs been on it for 16 years. This was his reaction:‚Äù  My mom put him on it when I was really young. He paid it. But she also asked for 30k in back pay. He thought when I turned 18 he didn‚Äôt have to pay it anymore. But he did and wasn‚Äôt able to keep up w 600/ monthly. Today I cleared his balance. He no longer owes them anything.  For y‚Äôall that don‚Äôt understand. When you can‚Äôt keep up w child support they garnish your pay, your tax refund, your drivers license, your passport. My daddy been on child support since he was 23. He‚Äôs 40 now. He deserved this.  He owed $27k in interest alone. That should tell u something  I did all the groundwork and she (mom) signed the papers. It was a process      In response to ‚ÄùI hope this doesn‚Äôt offend you but your mom is awful for that lol‚Äù   ""She isn‚Äôt. She had her reasons. It‚Äôs in the past now.""      ---      #/r/MensLib"
My ex didn‚Äôt pay child support for the entirety of my son‚Äôs childhood. My child and I had some difficult times...heat and electricity turned off, not enough food, too tight shoes. At times we depended on food stamps and other social services. But we made it through. My ex left the country to avoid paying his considerable arrears after the state rescinded his driver‚Äôs license and issued a warrant for his arrest for failure to pay child support. The weekend my son graduated from college, we came home to a letter from a lawyer saying that the ex wanted to return to the US and wanted to pay 18 years of child support back at once. He asked if we would forgive the interest. I talked to my son and we agreed to forgive it, and sent a message through the lawyer that we wished him well. My son was raised, he was/is a great guy, and every time I looked at his face, he reminded me of all the best qualities of my ex.  Edit: For some context, the interest was over $6k.
You can hear the release of stress. What a great daughter!
That's crazy. Glad everything worked out though. Good on your mom for signing the papers.
Thank you for posting the context..!   Also, after reading that last sentence, she has admirable maturity about the entire situation.
If she and her mom are cool with it good for them. Child support shouldn‚Äôt be about punishing anyone, it‚Äôs about participating in the raising of the child. I do not like it when the government steps in and makes it worse instead of helping what is already a highly emotional and stressful situation.
It‚Äôs not that simple. Kids are expensive and responsibility for that needs to be shared between the parents. I say this as a step-mom who‚Äôs husband pays child support in a joint custody situation.
Yeah, I am very impressed by the daughter's ability to empathize with both her mother and father. People aren't morally black and white and situations can be very complex. I'm glad it's all been worked out.
One of the milestones of adolescence is realizing your parents are flawed human beings just like you. Becoming an adult is forgiving them for it.
Definitely tried the casual ‚Äúnot crying‚Äù wipe
[Much, much better with sound](https://youtu.be/cEKzZNvNCd0?t=12).
Dad‚Äôs like ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs nothing,I got something in my eye‚Äô.
Ahhh much appreciated, I‚Äôm just the friendly neighbourhood crossposter.
The video is not in English, but you can get the gist of it pretty easily ;)   Edit: I posted my mom's reaction in r/aww as I wasn't sure happy crying moms are allowed here. You can check my profile if you want see it (happens about 30 minutes before this video was taken, when dad wasn't home)
I love his reaction when he realised halfway though talking to you! Didn‚Äôt need to understand the language to tell how much he loved you :)
Every one of the women in this video could be the exact same person, but from a different point in time.
"What is this, Fiddler on the Roof?  >TEVYE: ""I have FIVE DAUGHTERS!"" *raises hands to God*"
I love how happy the whole family appears to be, as if you have all found the secret to familial happiness. Your dad especially looks like he‚Äôs always smiling! He even has the twinkling, squinted eyes of mirth! Is he really like that all the time?
Awww. He looks like such a sweet dad.
Is that hebrew?
Aww thank you!
Haha those are my nieces. And well, yeah, we're related.
Modern Family, jewdition.
My friends call him jewish santa ü§∑ he's a really sweet guy (most of the time, when he's not annoying my mom).
Yes
Yep
I'm guessing the downvotes are your pun-ishment
The most adorable part was when he muttered to himself, ‚ÄúDang it, I almost made it...‚Äù but he was mic‚Äôd up so we could all hear him. 
Your brother has an 80s vibe to him!
Aww man, that is too cute. 
This...*waves to your entire submission; including your family, your lovely sister-in-law in that gorgeous dress, and that fabulous island perfectly centered in the shot*...is the most adorable part.  Many happy returns to them! 
Oh yes, he is very stylish in that sort of way. I mean, he had that suit custom made that shade of blue with this beautiful silk, tropically colored, paisley lining, so he‚Äôs obviously pretty serious about his ‚Äúlook‚Äù. I called him Tommy Bahama and he was mortified. Lol. 
That little girl strides up with such confidence. What a little star! No wonder Mum is moved to tears. I‚Äôm all watery eyed and I don‚Äôt even know the kid!
I love this one. That Mom is wonderful
r/happycryinggalgadots
Omg that little hop before she gets lifted up. What a sweet child.
Na man don‚Äôt take your frustration out on women being supportive and empowering each other. In all honesty there are toxic elements of feminism but EVERY single group, demographic, race, ect has a minority or subset of assholes which unfortunately are  loudest.  This video is awesome and the message is awesome. As a  male I have had numerous role models in media to look up to and it‚Äôs nice to see young girls, like this, can feel stronger when there are empowering role models to look up to. I have a younger sister and if I ever have a daughter one day I want her to have the feelings of strength in who they can be and opportunities I have had.   I know i just gave a rant and you may just be trolling but if you took the time to read great.
Grandad is rocking that retired and golfing look
That look says ‚Äúwell, there goes our quiet time!‚Äù
Wait I'm confused. They're \_at\_ the farm but also surprised that you got them a trip to the farm?
He absolutely is a retired golfer, good eye
Trust me, he isn‚Äôt the quiet type
Okay, so, long story short, we got them the trip as a present but they thought it was just them two and my auntie and uncle.   Then the whole family showed up.
I don't understand.  Start at the beginning.  What is a farm and what is a family?
Okay, so, a farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops, sometimes you see cows and piggies.  A family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship) you sometimes get babies and doggies in one.   I hope this cleared things for you
Sorry I can't read
Okay, so, in morse code   - ... - ..   ...‚Äî‚Äî...‚Äî__...    .....‚Äî-...-.‚Äî‚Äî....
Okay, so, french morse code  .................doesn‚Äôt exist because we beat them in the war and stole all their morse code machines............I think   French guy: oui
Good decision
This choked me up, how adorable.
This is precious. I‚Äôm happy crying with him. I love you Ben
It‚Äôs so pure!
Just another white cop killing a black man... with kindness.
What a ballbuster the cop was. Funny dude
I‚Äôm just gonna throw this out there - Todd is not a great name.
Tears of happiness... but mainly relief
I just want to hug and squeeze you both. This image is so sweet. I'm not crying, you're crying. 
This is so fucking adorable dammit
I've been an occupational therapist for a number of years I'm currently working in home care. when I was working in outpatient ,this was the number one reason for referrals for client Parkinson's folks. Usually right after the holidays there was a big influx of early 50s to Mid 60 year old males to work on gait and strength. They said they had a timeline to be able to walk their daughters down the aisle by a certain month. My friend who is the head physical therapist in that department loved the first part of the year because his secret passion was working with Parkinson's folks. Did your dad work with the BIG program? If not he really should look into it,it is a wonderful program. The therapist who would be doing it with him are specifically certified and trained with special techniques. The most challenging part is finding certified therapist.
He did not, but I'll have to tell him about it!  He has been battling depression because he can't move like he used to (in three years, he left the house maybe 15 times) but our wedding definitely was motivation to get out and start living his life again.  I think if he had more physical therapy, it would definitely help with the depression.  
‚ÄúMy baby home‚Äù   Doesn‚Äôt get any better than that
Why do I watch these at work? I cry every time.  Like a moth to the flame, I see a post like this and I click... every...single...time.  Something about dads showing emotion that just choke me up.
Omg that second time he said ‚ÄúJosh‚Äù :‚Äô]
"I love that the Dad still calls his son, a man fit and strong enough to be in the military, his baby. The son seems more than willing to wear the hat of both ""his dad's baby boy"" and ""honorable man serving his country"".  It's such an understandable juxtaposition."
This was the moment I knew I was about to cry
He had to double check it was her. Oh my goodness.
Visit your grandpa more jerk
That voice crack of pure happiness!
I hope I'm still that healthy looking when I'm 83.
My old aunt had Downs. She died when she was is her 60‚Äôs. We had her over for every thanksgiving and she LOVED my husband. She would always say, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my boyfriend!‚Äù And she often grabbed his ass!! We decided it was hilarious and laughed our asses off.  EDIT: To anyone who has issues with this:  1. SHE HAD CONSENT after the first time. My husband and I discussed it and he said it was not a big deal and was fine.   2. He let her do it as she wanted because she had dementia. DEMENTIA. She wasn‚Äôt always this way, and back then she didn‚Äôt do it. It was only with the arrival of Alzheimer‚Äôs.  3. Folks, the scale of the infraction is so minor, and the details here matter.  Life isn‚Äôt black and white. It‚Äôs grays. Lots of grays.
"The son reminds me of my very Downs uncle whom we call ""cousin"". So gentle. So loving. I worry about him when his second parent passes away though."
My younger brother had it.  One of the best people I‚Äôve ever known, which is why I asked him to be the best man at my wedding.  I get why other people sometimes just saw the condition, but I swear to God most of the time I forgot and just thought of it as his personal quirks.  I sometimes laugh when I think of the times that I‚Äôd introduce him to people and forget to tell them he had Down Syndrome.  He was always just the guy who like to liked to watch me play video games, or would get scared at lame action movies.  I remember that he used to call me his hero for ‚Äúsaving‚Äù him from a scary looking moth, or a house gecko that looked somehow vicious.  He passed years ago, but I still ache to see him again.  I wish I could have him tell me ‚Äúgood luck at your work‚Äù or ‚ÄúI love you with all of my heart‚Äù again.  When his visitation was done and we leaving the night before his funeral I made sure to close the door and tell him goodnight just like I did when we were growing up.  I know that this comment is buried, and he passed years ago so most people won‚Äôt understand why it still hurts.  I feel like an amputee or something that he is gone.
My uncle was downs but he was more like an awesome big brother. He got me into the WWF in the late 80s and we used to watch every pay per view together. He did a mean Hulk Hogan impersonation. I made him the best man at my wedding because I honestly didnt know a better man. The doctors told my grandparents that he would be a burden on them and that they should give him up, when he was born. He lived a long and awesome life and brought a lot of happiness to others. I miss him so much.
It‚Äôs okay. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt tolerate such a thing. But she has an intellectual disability and we don‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of nothin g.  When she comes over she wants a ‚Äúbeer and a piece of pie. Cherry pie!‚Äù That one beer affected her so she got a tiny buzz maybe and got uninhibited. She was always sweet and usually did not act inappropriately‚Äîwe asked when it first happened because we have nurses in the family.   When folks with Downs get old, many of them develop Alzheimer‚Äôs. At this point in her life she had been showing signs of dementia for several years. I‚Äôm an RN and I know dementia first hand. Some people who get demented or have damage in a certain area will become quite uninhibited, and they do things like grab people‚Äôs asses.   So yeah while I would be the first one to intervene if I saw anyone touch another inappropriately, she is family. We know why she did it and she is not sexual at all. It never went farther than that, and she never said anything other than how he‚Äôs a hunk (he is) and she wanted to hug him. That‚Äôs it. Harmless like a child. We just let it go because we get it: she‚Äôs not harming anyone and she‚Äôs not aware of the implications of doing it.
I‚Äôm at work and I am now crying because this is so wholesome and sweet.
Fuck, I wish I had a dad who loved me like this guy loves his son. Haven‚Äôt spoke to mine in 15 years. I‚Äôm so happy for this guy!  Edit:  holy shit my first gold. Thank you so much guys.   This post has made me so happy in an otherwise shitty week. Thank you!
This is so beautiful, being able to share this moment with a parent and to introduce your child to their grandparent. I love the little kid that jumps in to be a part of it. ‚ù§Ô∏è no matter how old we get, we always need family. 
The daughter running up to hug her father broke me, what a truly precious moment.
What‚Äôs the backstory? 
I'm your dad now. I'm proud of you son/daughter, You're a good person and I see you trying to do good in the world. 
They had been apart for 37 years, why isn't known.  https://www.godtube.com/watch/?v=YY6PGLNX
I know I'm not the only one who pretended that was for me also. Thanks, dad.
Anytime kiddo! Remember to eat well and watch the sunset every now and then. 
It takes a lot of bravery and courage to make that choice. I am proud of you for having the character to do that. Good job son, aim to do good in this world and good will come to you. 
These always make me cry. Damn.
Aww, kids are so lovely. Pure, unadulterated happiness.
:‚Äô)
You're not alone. I knew it was going to happen, but I watched it anyways. 10/10 would cry again
I'm super happy for this guy, but also wondering how they could legally do a procedure on him without him knowing exactly what they were doing?
Lovely video.  Sucks our health care system is such shit, and that dental and vision isn‚Äôt even included in our normal health care.  This shouldn‚Äôt be an uplifting story bc this should have never happened for so long untreated.  No one should live like this ‚Äî for lots of reasons, but especially bc dental health is linked to heart health and other medical issues.    Glad for this man though.  His happiness is palpable.
Maybe didn‚Äôt even read and signed the forms?
No, medical consent requires that the doctor tell the patient all the risks of a procedure before they agree. The patient must understand the risks for it to be legal. I assume it is the same in dentistry, since they are basically teeth doctors.
I asked my Dad to be my best man.   He cried.  I cried.   He gave the most epic best man speech ever.  One of the best decisions I have ever made.
I was confused for a second because I thought the son was the little boy.
I love when he can‚Äôt wait one more second so he steps forward and scoops his lil man up and holds him so tight and anyway who‚Äôs chopping onions in here 
Oh. My heart.
I'm not crying you are.  What an absolutely beautiful moment. 
He's so damn proud
You mean... You're crying.... Too hard to admit? Just say you're crying dammit! 
"If it makes you feel any better they didn't tell him he would never walk.  Doctors don't really do that. They might say it's unlikely, but they aren't just going to be like, ""you'll never walk so we aren't even going to give a fuck, just sit there and whatever.""  The reason he can walk is probably do to physical therapy and being encouraged to walk by the people who said it may be unlikely."
Thank you for the reply, and I‚Äôm assuming you know this family? And I‚Äôm guessing if you don‚Äôt then it‚Äôs meant well... however, I was told that my daughter would *never* walk. By a doctor. More than one. And lots of times.   Apparently, it was to help me accept that she never would.   She never has, and never will.   Just for a second I pictured myself in the father‚Äôs place and imagined how I would feel.   That‚Äôs why my heart hurt.    Edit. Downvoted for relaying my experience as a parent of a child with quadriplegic cerebral palsy or for another reason?   Edit: And there is a world of difference between a doctor saying ‚Äúyour child will be completely unable to walk because of <insert medical reasons> so we will be focussing on comfort and seated mobility with possible weight bearing for bone density‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never walk so just sit there, we don‚Äôt give a fuck or whatever‚Äù.
This could get reposted weekly and I'd still upvote and enjoy it every time.
Straight up ugly crying, that‚Äôs how I do too my dude. Awesome video.
Such a beautiful moment, such a great man. I am so glad they shared this.
As a dad, I can feel his joy - gave me goosebumps.
There should be a subreddit called Quality Reposts where good stuff like this can get posted over and over
Try it for like 14 hours. It's hard to breathe. Eventually you just pass out.
I broke down into full out ugly sobs the moment my daughter was born. I know exactly how it feels.
Yep, it's called reddit.
He said quality, though
[Original tweet](https://twitter.com/fcknmimi/status/651930334053793792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  You gotta hear his voice it's the best part. The crumbling attempts to stay composed are so much more powerful. He keeps that little growl in his voice like he's not phased all the way up until he makes eye contact with his family and then the bubble bursts.
This is probably my favorite sub. Seeing a man cry tears of joy is powerful stuff. Gives you a little perspective on stuff. These probably aren't wildly expensive but maybe for them it's an unneeded cost and clearly someone saved up just to give this man a dream experience. Fucking...awesome
This has already been posted here before, but a better version with sound. Still makes me cry.
No no no no no no no no!
My dad was diagnosed with cancer around this time last year. Me and my son went to go see him (my other siblings live in state and in neighboring states) and were already there. He didn‚Äôt know we were going. He was sitting in the living room about to eat a bowl of Pho and we walked in. This was his exact reaction... I can‚Äôt stop watching this because it reminds me of what‚Äôs burned in my minds eye. 
Maybe he wouldn‚Äôt look at you so crazy if you weren‚Äôt a fucking potato. 
No chinguen, mira mira mira, no no no no...  lol, mexican dads <3
The kid‚Äôll cherish this when they‚Äôve grown up. I lost my dad recently and I cherish the very few pictures / videos we took when he was still with us. Beautiful.
God wait til that kid goes to school for the first time...he‚Äôs finished! I can remember putting my kid in the bus for the first day of school and as it pulled out I cried now she‚Äôs graduated from college she gave me a grandson where I‚Äôm even more of a cry baby for the first.
I love these videos, but does it bother anybody else that they feel the need to subtitle them and put sappy music over it? It is already a big enough tear jerker, the music just makes it feel like they are taking advantage of my emotions...
What a great present for a even greater man!
That one made me tear up
Wow. My daughter has a similar situation but she‚Äôs only 12. I hope this is us one day. Good job man, it takes someone special to love someone else‚Äôs kid as your own. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I wish I had a dad
"yes absolutely. I wish they'd cool it with ""he loses composure and sinks to the floor"" like, NO FUCKING SHIT"
Thought he was just tying his shoelace. 
I love that it was the last one to pop. You're gonna be a great dad and sorry about your old man bud. Good luck!
I was terrified that it was going to be the first one I popped.
Congratulations!
Thanks.....milksteakboner69, I hope there‚Äôs not a story behind that name.
This is perfect and beautiful. Thanks for posting
I‚Äôm dying over the dude in the background, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bagel!‚Äù
Did he have his son when he was a child himself? He looks very young or he ages extremely well
Former player, Louie Debrusk. Son is Jake who plays for the Bruins.
My favorite thing about this is that he was a former player and he was the enforcer/tough guy
Mother checks phone, grandfather says it‚Äôs about damn time. 
That's a manly ass way to cry.  I imagine that's how Ron Swanson cried when Lil Sebastian passed.
[Louie DeBrusk, age 46](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_DeBrusk), born 1971, and had his son in 1996.   So he was 25 when he had his son. 
Damn I hope I look that good at 46
Posting your hot mom on Reddit. That's a bold move cotton let's see if it pays off.
Love how he instantly starts holding the bear like it‚Äôs an actual baby, being super careful. Great vid
The way he instantly holds the bear as if it‚Äôs a baby ‚ù§Ô∏è
SOMEONE GIVE THE POOR MAN A HUG
This is quite possibly the top 3 reactions, to anything, that I've ever seen. That instant bear snuggle...
I am so happy that women out there have fathers that love and cherish them, are capable of joy, and take an interest in their child's lives. It's so nice to see. It makes me angry that my dad sucks but it also fills me with so much happiness that there are ladies out there who can count on their fathers and are excited to share with them. It makes me jealous sometimes (like I so wish this guy was also my dad) because I never had momnets like this, but also reminds me that not every dad is like mine and gives me hope for my daughter. I know my husband is going to be a wonderful father and I know my girl will love him as much as this dude's daughter loves this dad. That means I get to see moments like this between them for all their lives. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Seriously! There are so many of these videos where I‚Äôm just ‚ÄúWHY IS NO ONE HUGGING HIM?!?‚Äù
This is the only circumstance you can gift-wrap something you pissed on.
As a dad, I want to hug this dad-to-be 
"...I've seen this several times and this is the first time that ""Baby Ruth"" and ""Dad's Rootbeer"" clicked in my head. I thought those were just things he liked."
While I think videos like this are adorable, I always feel bad that the moment being filmed takes away from the awesomeness of the moment. The person filming the video has to stop the video to hug. 
Eh... idk. I feel like she had already gotten the point across without the pee sticks...
I was frustrated that she hadn‚Äôt yet put the camera down. This man needs a hug, dammit.
Aw man. We need to take better care of our Veterans.
Omg who‚Äôs cutting onions I‚Äôm bawling
I mean good on pet smart and the individual who fronted the cash, but why the fuck is a veteran in this position? I‚Äôve seen them on the streets of Atlanta and Los Angeles and I can‚Äôt understand how we let these people down after they fight to keep us safe. Step up VA
Agreed.  This actually happens to a lot of hospitalized patients. If they don‚Äôt have friends/family to take over, it‚Äôs a possibility that they lose their pets. If they can‚Äôt bring them into the hospital, and the vet/shelter the pets are at doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on or act on it, they can be sent to a shelter. It‚Äôs very unfortunate, but also hard to intervene as a stranger.
When he asks ‚ÄúAnd Why‚Äôs that?‚Äù fully expecting some company policy shit, but then is greeted with the fact that he can actually take his babies home for free, you can tell he isn‚Äôt used to things like this, which is a crying shame.
Anyone else expecting a little kid (8-12) not a full grown adult? Haha either way this is great
The son even looks a lot older than the dad.     (I had to laugh at the ‚Äúfor‚Äù in the original title implying the bearded guy is the dad)
This should be tagged NSFW!  Pipe fitters don't cry at work!
That was the sweetest little happy frown I've ever seen
This is amazing,I love it.  I want to hug my dad right now.
You're gonna make me fucking cry
The kid is hamming it up for his dad. What a little fighter!
I think it‚Äôs the other way, an adorable baby cheering up his/her father.
As a new father, I want nothing more than that baby to be ok.
Oh my fucking God i hope the baby's alright.
Love how it says hi to everyone too.
He‚Äôs by far the happiest about the puppy.
Kevin Mawae was such a beast for the Jets for so long.   In the late nineties I went to a lot of games with my dad. One time, I saw him hustle off the field, find a trainer, and lift his arm. He had a massive, bloody gash running from his pinky to his elbow. Blood everywhere, dripping onto his pants, jersey, and all over the turf. The trainer gauzed it, taped it up, and he was back on the field within a few plays. Such a gnarly dude.
Awww! That‚Äôs nice! Dad needs a new camera though.
[for those concerned, he thanked his mother immediately after](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1157809290708602880?s=09)
That‚Äôs such a dad thing though. Visited my dad the other day, and he had this janky old pocket camera i could‚Äôve sworn I saw him using when I was in high school.   ‚ÄúI paid good money for this and it ain‚Äôt broke yet.‚Äù
Hot damn this is one of my favorite posts on here now. He‚Äôs so happy :)
It's 8 am and this just made my whole day. I was dreading going into work but seeing how happy he is made me feel better, thank you :) 
I love that little hug tackle at the end haha
Dude that jump was fucking phenomenal dude he is going to be a great dad and I would like to share a beer with him one day.
There's nothing better than seeing a grown ass man happy jumping like a 6 year old.. this is a perfect post OP! 
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all week
"This is awesome, although the cynical part of my brain said ""Yeah, tackle your wife who just told you that she's pregnant. Good call."""
Call it a 6th sense, but I would bet my life he‚Äôs going to be a great dad.  
This is exactly what my husband did when I told him I was pregnant with my first. Ran around the whole house whooping with joy then just about squeezed me to death.   It‚Äôs one of my favorite memories. üíú
Glad to share it with you!
Don‚Äôt squish the baby!
This is the second time I have seen this Judge on here giving common sense verdicts. Good for him.
Dads crying? More like I'm crying.
I wish there was some social assistance program that would ease the burden of the dad a little more :(
Sooooo that old man is beyond adorable and pulls on my heartstrings and the judge is funny and kind and I love it, but I am left wondering if maaaaaaaaaaybe the 96 year old man should not be driving anymore.
He looked genuinely upset when the judge said that he was setting a bad example for his son! I don‚Äôt think he picked up on the sarcasm but still a great ending
"He has a TV show on cable, ""Caught in Providence"" and a lot of youtube videos.  Not only does he apply common sense to almost all of his judgments, but the main prosecutor,  Inspector Ziggy Quinn, also has a lot of compassion and humor.  https://www.caughtinprovidence.com/"
he only drives when he has to
"I love how he goes from loud and boisterous sailor talk with, ""Well goddamn"" and ""who the fuck are you"", to suddenly soft spoken, sweet grandpa ""Oh honey"".  Turned that big old potty mouth tough guy into a big ball of mush right away."
That HAH NO WAY when he throws the card is awesome
Dave Letterman's loving that retired life
Card went fucking mach 10
Few times do you see such a fitting YEET
Gifts that get this type of reaction are the best. This is what giving is about.
This is a great video. I have a question i have always wanted to ask. Why does it take that long to write childrens books? Is it the story? The Pictures? What makes a person a good childrens book writer, especially for those books for kids aged between 1-4?
I'm not the best person to articulate what makes a *good* children's book author, but as my wife's job involves children's book publishing, I can say that I've seen so many *bad* children's books that it's become abundantly clear to me how hard it is to do them well. Some of the problems I've seen:  * Picture books where the text is way too long * *So many* books written in shitty iambic pentameter * Shocking number of books written in rhyming verse where the author seems completely clueless about the rhythm of the words * Books that condescend to the audience. It is actually possible, unfortunately, to be unnecessarily condescending even to very small children * Books that are basically one long, tortured, uninteresting didactic metaphor for some social/developmental issue. Or even worse, don't even manage to scrape together a metaphor and are just didactic and boring. It's great to write books that help kids to internalize good values. But it's actually really hard to do this in an effective way. * Books that are just fucking *boring*, even/especially for kids.  So I guess a good children's author is able to produce a book that is the opposite of all the things above. Like I said, I can't articulate all the elements of good children's writing, but a few things I've noticed:  * Good children's books tend to be *really* creative in ways that you might not even notice until you reflect on them. It's a level of creativity that's hard to pull off, and yet the effect is often very subtle. * Many of my favorite children's books - both when I was a kid and now, as a parent - involve an element of danger, or something like a little bit of darkness at the edges. It validates a feeling you have as a kid - a feeling you need to be able to process, and can also find thrilling, even when you're quite young. Think of *Where the Wild Things Are*, or *Harold and the Purple Crayon* (Harold is only playing an imaginary game with his crayon, yet on another level he's utterly lost in the world until he remembers what it is that comforts him about his room), or even the darknesses lurking outside the edges of the light in *Goodnight Moon* * Good children's books, like good parents and good teachers, take children seriously, even when they're being very silly.
[To Build a Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUFJJNQGwhk), is kind of cheating, song always gets me. Congrats to that guy, I expect to see that same crying face when he is on his 30th poop diper of the day.
My husband and I have been trying for 6 years after our first was stillborn. I fantasize about the day that I can finally tell him he‚Äôs going to be a dad. I hope it happens eventually.
As a father can confirm, he should be crying
I cried but also  I loved how he goes to take the baby but then he‚Äôs like  Wait how do I hold one of these
As a younger self, I would probably have not reacted to this video. But now, I am a happy crying dad. 
I've never seen a baby look so much like his father.
When I left for Iraq in 2006 my son was 2 weeks old. When I came home he was 15 months.  I'm 45 days out from my wife having my second child and I'm am so scared and happy. I completely understand this man's feelings.  It was so scary to think I wouldn't come home (I was a scout sniper) and every mission I would take my pictures, wedding ring, and name tapes off on the off chance I was killed or captured (I didn't want my family identified). Or if one of my family members was hurt and I was so far away. The emotional turmoil of a deployment is crazy.  Seriously choked up.
No. My heart can't take this, it's too sweet.
Anyone else just watching that kid the whole time he's on screen? 
Omg I love the little shocked turnaround and quiet little ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù
I wish my dad had loved me this much.
"The softest and most precious ""what the fuck?"" I have ever heard. Quality HCD :)"
Why were they separated for so long?
/r/Happycryingeveryone is always a safe bet
There's one if those baby seat things in th background, I'd say he's a dad and it fits.

I wish they‚Äôd zoom in on the top of those a little bit.  Curious about pulleys or what.  Making one of these would be fun for a backyard party, after the first few cases of beer are gone.
I love the helicopter motion at the end that turns into a vicious cycle cycle of him trying not to get domed
Why do I get the feeling these guys are in Australia?

Bernie Sanders and Trump are like the ultimate showdown of a 75 year long epic battle between capitalists and hippies.
Let's just put these two guys alone in a room together with a hidden camera.
"Bernie: ""Alright Donny, now this meal is for everyone in America. However, 90% of people share a single fry and the remaining 10% get everything else. What have you learned?  DJT: *reaching for a fry* "" That I can eat all of it if I blame the cooks?""  Bernie: ""NO TOY!"""
This edit is so well-timed!
>75 year long epic battle   I'd watch an epic rap battle between them
Sounds like a low-key celebrity death match lol
It's originally from when Trump was sitting next to a bald eagle and tried to reach out towards it and the eagle didn't take too kindly to it. They took out the eagle and replaced it with Bernie and added some fries. One of the best gifs ever made IMO  https://youtu.be/L32bvp2on2g?t=0m07s
Oh i‚Äôd pay for that, how ever much i actually hate Trump, that‚Äôs the only thing i‚Äôd actually pay him for.
Nah, for that you need to turn the camera off, like with Epstein.
Bernie destroying trump with disses about controversial shit and exposing him. Then trump starts his verse and there's money flying everywhere the crowd loves it and they immediately forget what Bernie said and trump wins. But when people watch the tapes after they all agree Bernie should have won it.
He was asked to pretend to be a bald eagle and someone is about to steal his fries I think.

Lmao didn't even notice the popcorn guy the first 5 times
That guy in yellow shirt sitting in middle of his parents looks to be held captive! lol
Scripted AF
It's probably planned that's why. If you look the guy with the popcorn is ready to move before the camera even adjusts.

Idk, he looks like he‚Äôs getting low to be on camera, then stands when it shifts upwards.
New band name. Called it
It could be I just never trust any of these stadium can shots any more. 90% are scripted.

That‚Äôs the ‚Äòoh fuck! Have I just killed a man?‚Äô shit your pants moment.
Worked in a tire shop. We played pranks am the time. My favorite was this reverse prank the young kid posted on my buddy. He went to the washroom, and my buddy loaded the air blaster and when the kid came he blasted him and the kid fell backwards into the bathroom. My buddy had a good chuckle and returned to work. Well the kid didn't come out of the bathroom for 20mins, finally we noticed he had not come out and when we opened the door we found him lying on the ground. My buddy stated freaking out insanely worried and flipped him over to start CPR. The kid was fine, but he had a sopping wet towel from the toilet that he slapped my buddy in the face with as soon as he could.  Those were good days.
No u
The commitmentüëå
That‚Äôs because it was real. He just played it cool.

20 minute wait face down in the bathroom to slap someone with a sopping wet towel in the face?!  I can appreciate the commitment.

This one really is better with every loop. The cork bouncing off of his head. No sooner does that fact register than the drink starts to gush out of the bottle and now he has to deal with that :-)
Just like when I tell myself I‚Äôll last more than 2 strokes this time but then come across a brand new kink
Beans are my new kink
ever since i read he has this weird forward-lean probably due to wearing shoes lifts in his shoes, i havent been able to think his weird posture is caused by anything else.
Bigfoot and Smallhand
If you asked me 5 years ago which would happen first, I'd have picked proof of Samsquanch before Trump president.
Totally not the same. One of them is an ill-tempered, dim-witted, hulking land mammal and the other is Bigfoot.
You can really see his diaper in this image.
This will be downvoted but at least you will know. His forward lean is 100% designed to hide his massive chest and gut. He has learned from years of being on camera that he can lean forward and his suit jacket will hang straight and create the illusion of a flat chest. It only works when he‚Äôs squared up to the camera. From the side it looks ridiculous. Shoe lifts don‚Äôt make you lean forward.
You know, a lot of middle aged men have to get their prostates removed due to cancer, which can cause temporary and permanent incontinence based on the amount of nerve and muscle that needs removed.  Like, I get that Trump is a piece of shit, but shaming a person that needs to wear a diaper is, in my opinion, the same as shaming a woman that had a mastectomy for being flat chested.
while i can appreciate your defence for those who have had cancer and their plight.  I was making a reference to a reddit post from a week ago where he has to wear a diaper due to his abuse of narcotics.
This is probably some physics shit. I can smell the science.

I almost wonder if the cats reflexes were so good that it saw the motorcyclist falling down before our eyes could catch it and that's why it touched the screen.

I live in Beijing and EVERY NIGHT in the bigger public parks you will find hordes of elderly people doing all sorts of dancing. But for some reason shuffling is reeeeeally popular.

What's with all the happy delivery people gifs lately, was one caught stealing packages again?
I would do this every single day if this were my job. Guy is a legend in my book
I'm surprised he stayed that long. My ups guy basically stretches for the bell while simultaneously dropping the package and turning with out breaking a stride, truely amazing to watch.
To be fair those signs are pretty patronizing
Your packages go through MUCH worse getting organized before getting loaded into the truck.
Ring cameras aren't going to sell themselves.
But how swole is he? Should I lift boxes for a living? Maybe I could start a business and charge people to move furniture as a new workout craze.
General rule of thumb is that if you‚Äôre packing something fragile, if you aren‚Äôt comfortable throwing the box down your stairs or across the room then it‚Äôs going to break in transit.
I worked for ups for a while, in a DC loading the delivery trucks as well as semi trailers. I was pretty well jacked the whole time I worked there, we all were. Best workout routine I ever had, plus it paid decent and had great insurance.
you raise me uuuuuup, so I can stand on moooooountaaaaains...
I want my cat to do this.
I appreciate the fact that this person put a GoPro on their head just to lift their cat.

My cat does. Although it's great, you always have to deal with him walking in your path every 5 seconds.
The amount of times i've kicked my cat because she wanted to rub my legs while walking, makes me think she was a soccerball in a past life.

That 4th kid tho. What a hero
The dedication to know each and every one of his students in such a way is astounding. This man was born to teach.
Speaking as a teacher, I just have to say: How the everloving fuck?
"""Aaannd there goes the bell, goodbye Children"""
Literally everyone feels special with a secret handshake. Good dude.
Does he remember each kid‚Äôs specifically or does he have to do them all in a specific order or he‚Äôll mess up?   Also, I like that one kid‚Äôs was just a salute.
Yoooo I met this guy at a conference! And; it should go without saying, he was cool as shit.
One thing that I want to mention (I already replied something similar to the haters at the bottom so that they can learn something) is that this is excellent classroom management! If you respect children and make them feel seen and heard, they are more likely to respect you in return! That respect takes the form of following class rules. If every child respected the teacher and sat and was receptive to his lesson, everyone would have a better learning experience as opposed to having the lesson constantly stopped while the teacher disciplines unruly students.
Idk if that kid is technically MORE creative or less creative...?
"I know I would be the 4th guy. "" Fuck this shit I'm out """
4th kid doesn't like being touched, and teacher respecting that is wholesome in itself.
This man was born to inspire.
Look. I'm way better at building relationships than I am teaching. I admit that fact. I'll take the Pepsi challenge with any colleague I've ever had in getting to really know my kids.  I have some old guard colleagues who work their asses off. They put in way way more time and energy than I do *teaching*the  kids. They don't build shit for relationships. They teach. When kids tell me they don't like Ms whatever, they will always then agree that Ms whatever is a **good** teacher.  All I'm saying is this man may make kids enjoy school and enjoy being in his class. And that makes them more willing to learn. But it doesn't make him an amazing teacher, just a good person.  Teachers that genuinely enjoy students are unfortunately rare, but so are the teachers who go in and just teach their balls off. And those ones never get much credit because they aren't flashy and kids don't yell out their name when they walk through the lunchroom. But it's a lot easier to do the job every day when kids idolize you. Ms whatever is on that grind simply because she was born to be a teacher.
"He's an elementary teacher with a total of around 17 students if my count was right.  My mom sent me this video when it first came out saying ""Oh you should do something like this!""  My yearly class load is around 200 students. Motherfuckers should be glad I remember their names."
And don't forget kids..  It's rude to leave without a handshake
We'll have to conduct a stringent set of standardised tests to find that out.
This man was born to be a man.
I can‚Äôt even remember the names of my 5 professors

This was last bit of inspiration this kid needed. Get ready to see this clip again in 15 years when he‚Äôs playing in a World Series.
That's the look of a kid who realizes the experience is worth more than the ball.
For the record it is legit for the kid to try to catch the ball in this case and it is not interference, because the ball is coming down into the stands.
This is how Mac looks at Chase Utley.
Totally. That kid was about to get beaned.
Yup. Kid's a rookie, never close your eyes!
He's got no legs.
If there‚Äôs someone on base and less than two outs they can tag up on a fly ball caught in foul territory. That ball is still live.

Worked at a gas station where we gave away a 2 liter pop with every 30 liters of gas for the cost of the deposit only. Several dozen people wouldn‚Äôt take the pop, so we would pay out of pocket for the deposit and then spend our down time gathering up all the shitty flavors, tossing them in air as high as we could and launching the pop rockets into the surrounding area. These days it‚Äôs all developed and there are just too many cars, but back then there was nothing g but fields around the station and it was the most fun you could have for 20 cents.

I think that offering opinions on Reddit teaches us to be careful and tactful in the way we express ourselves because we are all very sensitive and hate being criticized harshly.
After 8 years on this site as of today, this is absolutely true - kinda.  The only real difference between the exact same comment being upvoted to glory or being brigaded to the depths of the underworld is the company you keep.  There is nothing more frustrating than attempting to be the voice of reason amongst zealots.

I'm a residential framer. This is incredibly hard. Planed out lumber from a lumber plant even has deficiencies that would stop this. When you leave lumber outside some is more wet than others and will dry and crown twist or bow at different rates. To do this he probably planed all the lumber himself and put it on a lazer leveled foundation and re checked the level/plane after. Or you know his level is bent like a ski and he's just pulling a fast one on us. I guarantee 99.9% of people's floor joists are not done this nice.

Does he step on the edge of the ball to pop it to his right foot or does he kick/sweep it?
I've seen it 30 times, he commands the ball with his foot to leep into his hand... that's all I got
He steps on the side of the ball which accelerates it. With his other foot he creates an angle for the ball to bounce up into his hand.
Yeah he steps on it and it shoots to his right foot and then he kicks it up. I‚Äôve played tennis for 16 years and still can‚Äôt fucking do it
Not to be a topper but I have watched it 40 times and I reckon it's magic.

The scene with the building falling from Steamboat Bill, Jr. was very real and damn near could've killed him if he missed his mark.
All hail Buster Keaton.
It was only a single-storey drop, but Buster Keaton was originally supposed to make the jump! He had a policy of adapting his stunts if he couldn‚Äôt do them in one take (!!!), so this scene evolved into him falling down the side of the building. [This video](https://youtu.be/UWEjxkkB8Xs) goes into a bit more detail.
That one is a camera trick. He's stationary in front of a projection.
I believe it caused a lot of drama on set too, with workers threatening to quit in the hopes of convincing him to not do the stunt
You can even see it clipped his arm but he stayed composed which is damn impressive

They don't recognize him, he later walks up with someone and they confirm that person was the theif. It's a really interesting look at human perception."
Shit I guess I'm good 'cause I saw it first time.

First the man in Black has crutches and the man in yellow is running. After they bump into each other, the man in Black runs away and the man in yellow is in crutches. You don't notice until later that they switched.
There‚Äôs a lot of power behind the human mind and yet I think it‚Äôs is so easily manipulated.
Not the point. Easier to see it the first time when you're viewing in a video where you know something interesting is about to happen. You're not in the situation, reacting, looking at other things, talking to other people, distracted by other's around you.
i noticed right away
Lemme have this one dude.
So did he win the car?
But he slowed time down, that‚Äôs cheating!

Is it just me or is the gif cut off halfway through?
The way he did that epic button push I thought it was measuring his punching strength or something like in the DBZ tournaments
"""Why is this better every loop?""  >Because of the way its better every loop."
He probably won one entry towards the grand prize: the car
Seriously though, why does every video of anyone doing a thing have to have a bunch of unnecessary slow mo?
No. I saw him get 9.91 about 10 times in a row. He‚Äôs very precise.
He won the 1953 Ferrari after that impressive showing of skill
And nobody ever hears about who won it.
I like it when they show full speed and then the slow motion part after. If it just has the slow motion part it's hard to relate to and see how I'll never be able to do anything cool.
My friend won a Harley and $10,000 towards accessories or parts for it.  We both entered at a cigar shop. You got two tickets for the raffle for buying a cigar. I was the last person to enter, gave it a spin for luck. I win nothing and this jackass wins the first prize, which was a bunch of merchandise and a 1/50 chance at the bike (they were doing one drawing per state then the grand drawing).   He calls me two or three months later and tells me he won. They flew him out all expenses paid to watch them build the bike, pick out his parts, and party nonstop (smoking $100 cigars and drinking all day) for a long weekend.  All in all everything he got was probably over $30,000 worth of stuff including the bike. I won the pleasure of teaching him how to ride a motorcycle. I might sound bitter but I'm really happy for him. He doesn't have a lot of money and it was a struggle for him to get the money for the taxes together but he loves that bike more than anything, and he really appreciates it.  So moral of the story is, it happens.

"It sounds like you're confusing [sidereal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time) with [solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time).  A sidereal day is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to rotate by 360¬∞, and is indeed 23h56m4s.  A solar day is the interval between two successive instances of the Sun crossing the [local meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_\(astronomy\)).  Since the Earth moves by roughly 1¬∞ around the Sun each day, the Earth has to rotate by roughly 361¬∞ for the Sun to cross the local meridian.  In [this image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sidereal_day_\(prograde\).png), sidereal time is the difference between the blue circles labelled ""1"" and ""2"", where solar time is the difference between the blue circles labelled ""1"" and ""3""."
"That's how long it takes for a 360¬∞ rotation of the earth. Since it's also revolving around the sun it requires more than a 360¬∞ turn for the same point to be facing the sun again. Therefore, a ""day"" as we know it is more than 360¬∞ and a lot closer to 24 hours than your estimate."
"Your math is off, we add add the lap day because the solar year is actually about 365 1/4 days, we add the extra day every 4 years to account for that. We actually had to change it a while back to account for the fact that its slightly less the 365 1/4   Heres a better explanation...  The exact length of a solar year is actually 11 minutes and 14 seconds less than 365 ¬º days. That means that even if you add a leap day every four years, the calendar would still overshoot the solar year by a little bit‚Äî11 minutes and 14 seconds per year. These minutes and seconds really start to add up: after 128 years, the calendar would gain an entire extra day. So, the leap year rule, ""add a leap year every four years"" was a good rule, but not good enough!  Calendar Correction, Part II  To rectify the situation, the creators of our calendar (the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582) decided to omit leap years three times every four hundred years. This would shorten the calendar every so often and rid it of the annual excess of 11 minutes and 14 seconds. So in addition to the rule that a leap year occurs every four years, a new rule was added: a century year is not a leap year unless it is evenly divisible by 400. This rule manages to eliminate three leap years every few hundred years.  https://www.infoplease.com/leap-year-101-next-when-list-days-calendar-years-calculation-last-rules"
No, 23h25m4s is the length of a *sideral day*, which is the time it takes to face the same direction relevant to an object outside the solar system (such as the galactic center). A solar day (the time it takes for the sun to reach the same angle in the sky) is about 24 hours (give or take a few seconds on certain days, considering the earth moves at different speeds at different parts of its ellipse).  Leap years are a different kettle of fish. You see, the speed at which the earth rotates, and the speed at which it revolves around the sun are not connected, and the solar year is 365d5h48m46s (which is 11m14s less than 365.25 days) so we accumulate nearly a quarter of a day (to be specific, 24.219907407407407407407407407407%) per year, which would mean over time, our calendar would slip and we'd end up with summer in the northern hemisphere for christmas! over the course of 100 years, autumn would begin to creep into august, and spring into January, as the seasons shifted over by 24 days. So, we could add an extra day ever 4 years to fix it right? However, since the solar year is 11m14s shorter than that .25, we're now shifting 11m14s a year in the other direction. in 128 years, we'd be one day off. So we do better by NOT including an extra day on years divisible by 100. But we also knew we could do better, so we made an exception to that rule: If the year was divisible by 400 it WOULD be a Leap Year. Now it will take 3300 years to diverge for the calendar year and solar year to converge by a single day!
This is the answer. All the leap year mumbo jumbo is essentially independent of this
360 degrees in a circle, 365 days in a year, eg, like you said, ~1 degree a day. I don't know why, but that's pretty cool to think about like that and I never had before.  Thanks!
The approximately 24 hour day that we know is called a solar day, and the 4 minute shorter day is called a stellar day.  edit:  Just as a ball park calculation to see why it's four minutes shorter: with respect to the sun, in 365 days, the Earth rotates 366 times (365 times around its own axis, and once due to its orbit). With respect to itself, the Earth rotates 365 times in that time. So the following two ratios should be about the same:  366/(24*60) = 0.254166...  365/(24*60-4) = 0.254178...   
Yep. The actual length of a day is 24 hours and 0.002 seconds on average (and very gradually getting longer as the Moon recedes).
Exactly. After one solar year, the earth has made 366.25 rotations relative to the universe. But since the earth is rotating around the sun in the same direction, we experience only 365.25 sunsets each year.
Seriously, this explanation made me feel smarter for understanding it. Hi, I'm 37 years old and I learned something today that I can teach my son.
Interesting is that the closeness of both numbers (degrees in a circle and days in a year) is not a coincidence.   5150 years ago the sumerians were the first (that we know of) to count the days of the year (to know when to seed the grains, and using the fact that the shadow of a stone at noon each day repeats after a year). They got the 360¬±4 days number, which is relatively close to 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360 - and they already considered the 3 x 4 x 5 = 60 a pretty magic number (roughly how we consider 100 a significant number today) so surely that cannot be a coincidence, it must mean something!   So the sumerians picked a 360 days year, and decreed that the remaining 5 days are outside of the year, so why work then if nobody counted interest on loans during those  days (by religious decree), let's spent 5 days partying, drinking, and celebrating the new year!   And this is why we have 360 degrees around the circle - one degree is the distance covered by the Earth around the sun during one day.  
A.K.A. sidereal time.
If you think that's cool, try the implications: first, the Earth rotates by a degree every 4 minutes, and by 15 degrees an hour.  Second, if you go outside and look at the stars, and you want to see the stars tomorrow night in exactly the same position they're in now, you need to look 4 minutes earlier.
Which is, counterintuitively, pronounced sigh-deer-eal.
No, this is handled by leap seconds rather than leap years.  Leap seconds adjust the daytime so sunrise isn't eventually at 2PM.  Leap years adjust the seasons so spring isn't eventually in September (in the northern hemisphere).
"put a chair in the middle of the room. look at the chair. spin yourself in a circle (pirouette) and end looking at the chair again.  Thats 360 degrees.   Now spin yourself in a circle, while simultaneously taking a step around the room, and still end up facing the chair. Because you moved around the room you have to turn further than 360 degrees to end up facing the chair again.   (If you walk around the room the ""wrong"" way, it will be less than 360 degrees, if you walk around it the ""right"" way, it will be more than 360 degrees)  So if you keep spinning and going around you could count two things  1) How many times did I look straight at the chair. (solar day) 2) How many times did I spin in a complete circle (360 degrees)  Those are two different numbers.   The following image may illustrate : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sidereal_day_(prograde).png  "
There was an old Andy Griffeth show about the extra 4 minutes because of someone thought Barney didn't use his turn signal so they had to wait the next day minus 4 minutes to get the same sun glare on the turnsignal
The etymology is sider- (sidus, sideris: star, constellation) + -e (-eus, like X) + -al (-alis) = sidereal (siderealis)  from sidus, sideris you also get the words consider and, through French, desire.

"There is a fixed amount of water available in the basin that varies only slowly over decade time scales. So if Ethiopia builds a dam close to the source of the water and stores it there this will have results downstream. A minor effect would be the evaporation from the lake which would be lost to the region (the recycling factor in the Ethiopian highlands is small). A major effect would be a quick fill which would temporarily cut off water supply to the downstream areas. A long term effect would be that in times of drought Ethiopia has control over the distribution and can keep more water for itself. All of these are negative effects for Egypt's water security. As for the claim that Egypt's waterflow is increased by reducing Lake Nasser evaporation, this is really a wry statement. It means that they might reduce the level of Lake Nasser by siphoning of more water upstream thereby decreasing the volume of the lake and the area from which it can evaporate. That might slightly reduce evaporation in Egypt which is what they could mean by ""increased water flow"" but I don't see how Egypt's total water budget would increase because of this.  That said, if Ethiopia's dam is properly managed it might increase the overall water security of the region, something that would also benefit Egypt. It all depends on the amount of irrigation Ethiopia is going to develop with this dam."
"The dam will reduce evaporation (deeper water with less relative surface area), but Egypt WILL get less water while the dam fills (could take a year or more depending drought), and then they are reliant on Ethiopia to let the water flow. I see no reason why Ethiopia would ever send that ""saved water"" to Egypt. "
Its like temporarily moving the surface area of Lake Nassir upstream to Ethiopia, and then adding a lot more volume in depth. The water in the middle and the bottom does not evaporate, only the water exposed to the surface is in danger of evaporating due to the hot and dry air of northern Africa.   It will not just be better, it will be a LOT better. The average amount of water that falls in the mountains of Ethiopia is fairly well set. It will not grow. It flows down the mountains to Egypt, and in the shallow Lake Nassir, much of it evaporates into the air.   To keep as much of the Ethiopian rain in storage as possible, it must be stored in a deep reservoir in the cool and moister high Ethiopian location, then flow it down to Egypt as needed.   The hot and dry-air Lake Nassir MUST be made smaller, and the reservoirs in the high, cool, and moist Ethiopian mountains MUST be made larger.  Egypt hates this because it gives Ethiopia control over a vital resource, and they do not trust each other. If Ethiopia and Egypt were one country, this would have been done long ago...
Liquid will only evaporate from the surface exposed to air, and so is dependent on and relative to exposed surface area. As you fill a container with liquid, the surface area exposed to air will by necessity increase at a slower rate than the volume being stored, if at all (in the case of vertical or narrowing container walls as height increases). So the deeper your container is filled, the slower evaporation will happen relative to the volume of liquid contained within. 
While you're probably right, it actually depends on the surface area, elevation and environmental conditions at the location of the two lakes.   It might be that Lake Nasser is very large and shallow in an extremely dry area, and the newly created lake in Ethiopia is extremely deep with almost no surface area.  I'm not sure what the situation is or the proposal, but they could be correct...not saying it's a good deal as a result.
To me it sounds more like I'll lower your taxes by decreasing the total amount of money you have.
For an extreme -- consider earlier proposals to [restore Lake Chad to its historic sizes](https://books.google.com/books?id=_Fz9CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA560&lpg=PA560&dq=sorgel+lake+chad&source=bl&ots=vhs_Ja1Vaf&sig=HPGccIkdxGVKfX_Rm8seJm3kaBw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVsJy97OvYAhUPHqwKHfqNCfgQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&q=sorgel%20lake%20chad&f=false).   If such a project were undertaken, it'd change the climate so much, Africa's deserts [would probably no longer be deserts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantropa) at all. 
Not if it makes the next lake downstream smaller. The total surface might even shrink.
"To be more precise, it is:   ""I can reduce the total amount of taxes that both of us pay combined by holding on to more of the money.""   The evaporation rate of the GERD is expected to be much lower than from Lake Nasser. So the dam should result in more total water being available to Egypt and Ethiopia combined, but it seems extremely unlikely that Ethiopia will only draw off the water saved by those efficiency gains.  "
This is just incorrect. Dams can increase water supply when you need it, I.e when the flow is low. So on sum you won‚Äôt get more water, but your minimums will be way less minimum, while your maxes will be lower by a similar amount.  If managed well, This is a good thing.
"The point of the Aswan High dam / Lake Nasser is to control water flow - prevent flooding in the spring and droughts in the fall. If that water flow was regularized further up the river, where it's cooler and there's less evaporation, then the Aswan dam needs to hold less water, and hence less overall evaporation.  Of course, if Ethiopia uses the resulting lake storage to increase their irrigation, then there would be less water downstream. This is something the Western US states have been fighting over for years, with the Colorado river. It feels a bit condescending to accuse either Ethiopia or Egypt of being ""unable"" to manage the water when the history of the Colorado River Compact shows that we're perfectly willing to make up flow data and otherwise misrepresent the facts to steal water from each other.  "
A fun bit of trivia:  In polytrauma injuries involving a traumatic brain injury and bone fracture, the fracture may actually heal at a faster rate than the same fracture alone. The mechanism is currently not well understood, but some researchers speculate it's related to enhanced macrophage mobilization.  EDIT: For some more formal reading, check out some of work being performed in small animal models: [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25682315), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26636276), [and here](http://globalprojects.ucsf.edu/project/murine-model-polytrauma-understanding-molecular-basis-accelerated-bone-repair-concomitant). Then, even more exciting, check out [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323691) that looked at human patients with combined TBI + fracture injuries. Finally, to try to sum it up as best as we can, check out these lit reviews: [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25873754) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15710151)
Common to have multiple injuries, like in the surgical ICUs from traumas. Healing comes down to infection control, nutrition (usually the issue) and rehab.  With large body surface area burn patients, very hard to feed them enough, even with a feeding tube 24 hrs a day to meet calorie requirements to heal.  Edit for additional info: Acute critical illness can lead to catabolism exceeding anabolism, even in adequately nourished people. Obesity, is equal or more risk for wasting.
A distal injury won't affect another injury until it begins needing more resources than the body has to distribute - take burns for example.   If you had a burn on your hand all sorts of plasma and proteins and immune related cells would be rushing to the site (some already there) causing both local inflammation and an immune response that ultimately results in a blister - the blister is full of immune cells that help to repair the damaged tissues by providing an ideal micro environment for healing. Now let's say there's a burn to a large portion of your body; depending on the degree and the inflammation response (3rd degree burns have a different response as many of the biological channels of cell repair are completely destroyed) while your body will send out all its required immune cells that it has it might simply not be enough - in this case bacterial infections can take hold in the blisters as they provide an ideal environment for certain infections to grow, this results in sepsis and eventually septic shock. Imagine that the bodies immune repair system is spread too thin to repair both burns - it doesn't have a very good system at establishing where it should send immune cells with regard to controlling sepsis beyond directing blood away from the extremities and towards critical organs as septic shock progresses.   Ultimately it depends on the nature of the two injuries but yes they could affect one another.
To answer the question simply, yes, absolutely.   Different types of illness have unique calorie requirements.   A polytrauma patient is different than a septic patient is different than a burn patient with regards to protein, carbohydrate, electrolyte, and fluid requirements.   A dietician who works in the ICU could probably answer this question a lot more thoroughly than I can. I usually just write the order for a nutrition consult and leave it up to them.   Source, am a doc, although this is definitely not my area of expertise. 
I understood the first part. But my medical and anatomical knowledge is limited :(
Wow. I'm curious now how many calories are used in the repair of different injuries.  UPDATE : http://ask.metafilter.com/112868/How-to-measure-calories-burned-to-heal-from-various-injuries
>very hard to feed them enough, even with a feeding tube 24 hrs a day to meet calorie requirements to heal.  is the hard limit the amount of stuff you can physically get in there or the body's ability to process it once it's inside? 
Does that mean that in some cases it's better to leave a blister intact to heal on its own instead of popping it?
> (Bone isn't a tissue but you get what i mean) with two types of ressources to rebuild.  Of course bone is a tissue. It contains osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and various other cell types. They require the same nutrients as every other cell, and osteoblasts require calcium on top of that.   As to the original question, I don't think there are any data to suggest that a local injury affects regeneration of a more distant local injury. To put things in perspective, your skin and gut are *constantly* shedding tissue and regenerating it. A papercut it is a drop in the bucket compared to those metabolic demands.   Bone, likewise, exists as a dynamic equilibrium between osteoclasts, which are constantly destroying it, and osteoblasts, which are constantly making new bone. You can think of healing as osteoblasts temporarily getting the upper hand. There are plenty of situations where unwanted new bone is produced (eg osteoarthritis) with no impact on metabolism or healing elsewhere.
"Macrophages are white blood cells that eat other cells and ""debris"" like dead cells, bacteria, and virus infected cells.   The guess there is that a brain injury causes more of them to circulate through your blood stream, leading to a better ""cleaning"" of the fracture site, and faster healing. "
Dietitians will frequently calculate increased calorie requirements for our patients in the ICU based on the etiology of their disease for example trauma, infection, burns, etc.   Source, am a doc. 
In relation to your curiosity, I find this to be fun and relevant information.  Exercising is a form of injury infliction,  when you exercise you essentially create micro tears and muscle breakdown.  Your body then uses calories on top of your basal metabolic rate to facilitate the muscle damage repair.  Not only do you repair this muscle but it grows more robust to prevent that same injury from occurring again from the same amount of work output.  Even your bones will grow thicker and more robust in response to the torque applied to the structures.  (Best prevention and reversal for osteoporosis is weight lifting anything even a couple pounds heavier than what your body is used to). All this burns calories due to self inflicted micro injuries.   Edit: Yeah,  I like biology not grammar
That's pretty much always a better idea simply because opening a blister introduces an infection risk.
Are we talking like 4000 calories/day, or like 12,000?
Am surgical/trauma chief resident, I can answer this.   Looks like most answers are vague.  So there are equations out there to calculate what a persons basal metabolic rate is, ie calories needed to lay in bed and breath.  For the average person this is somewhere around 1800 calories or so.    For the severe poly trauma patients and the severe sepsis (infection) patients where nutrition becomes important, they are usually bed bound, intubated, and very sick, (I'll have them on lots of meds and all sorts of crap.)  For these patients, we will typically not only increase their caloric intake from their basal metabolic rate by 30% or so, we will also make sure they are getting 2grams of protein per kilo (basically the same as recommended for weight lifters).   This is usually done through a feeding tube as they can't swallow.    There are complex methods of determining if that is adequate, it's called a metabolic cart and it measures various chemicals or proteins your body puts out to get a specific caloric need.  This is not done often, as it's difficult.  And mostly we can eyeball it with our equations and get it really close.   Literally could talk for an hour about nutrition in the super sick patient but I think you get the idea.  So calories around 2500 for the avg sized person and protein around 150 grams a day.  
You'd gain 2.5 lbs of fat PER DAY on a 12,000 calorie diet even assuming an extremely high (3000 kcal) TDEE  EDIT: this was just a little joke based on the rule of thumb that adding 3,500 calories to your weekly total energy expenditure, you should expect to gain about a pound of body weight (fat or muscle). It's not actually possible to put on multiple pounds of mass in a 24 hour period. RIP your glycemic index if you ate like this, though.  
Absolutely. Popping pimples can run the risk of rupturing the wrong way and sending some very nasty bacteria right into your body. If that happens, most likely outcome is just making it worse/heal slower, but there could certainly be a worse infection.
Your body doesn't actually absorb the whole 12,000 calories, right?  In addition to some other things I can't remember, I recall that insoluble fiber also regulates calories absorbed.  
That's why so many professional athletes (especially football players) gain so much weight when they retire. That 8000 calorie a day appetite doesn't just go away overnight. 
It also accounts for the concerns when an athlete shows up after the off-season 10-20 pounds heavier. While the extra weight may affect that athlete's performance, it more importantly indicates that they were slacking on training in the offseason.
There are generally a few reasons.  One of the biggest being that higher altitude means thinner atmosphere and less resistance on the plane.   There's also the fact that terrain is marked by sea level and some terrains may be much higher above sea level than the takeoff strip and they need to be able to clear those with a lot of room left over.  Lastly, another good reason is simply because they need to be above things like insects and most types of birds.  Because of the lower resistance, at higher altitudes, the plane can almost come down to an idle and stay elevated and moving so it also helps a lot with efficiency.   Edit:  Forgot to mention that weather plays its part as well since planes don't have to worry about getting caught up in the lower atmosphere where things like rain clouds and such form.
Pilot here,  We can start by forgetting about piston aircraft that don't have any great benefits going above 10,000 feet compared to say 5,000 feet.   Turbo-prop aircraft (Q400 or ATR-72) usually cruise around 30,000 since they have a benefit of the prop biting into a bit of a thicker atmosphere vs. a higher and thinner atmosphere  Jet turbine aircraft (737, 320, Cseries) leans itself out as the go higher: air:fuel ratio becomes most efficient. A rich vs. a lean engine in a piston aircraft can go from a 12:1 air to fuel ratio to an 8:1 fuel ratio in a few thousand feet and usually cannot get better than that.   All other factors like greater fuel efficiency (fuel burns can be cut in half to 1/4 of lower alt. burns), drift-down time (Gimli glider), greater radio reception and radar guidance, obstacle avoidance, but mainly its turbine performance (concorde cruised at 60,000), not friction avoidance.  One misconception is the friction factor. A headwind of +5kt at a higher altitude will not outweigh the benefits of less friction at a greater altitude. Oxygen (atmosphere) drops off a lot after 12,000 ft.  I've changed cruising altitude from FL 19,000 to 13,000 ft to gain another 30 kts.  
u/stoplightrave us partially right. However, one reason no one has mentioned is that most want to travel as fast as possible. The higher you go the less drag and thus the faster you go with least amount of effort.
Thinner air actually makes an engine less efficient, but this is offset by increased airspeed in a turbojet engine due to an increase in ram air. A high bypass turbo fan or turboprop still loses efficiency due to the thinner air. Efficiency is primarily gained by the much much colder air temperatures at higher altitudes, which more than offsets the reduction in thrust due to less dense air. I can‚Äôt recall exactly why this is but the lower temperature is the biggest reason turbine engines are best at high altitudes.   Also, because of the thinner air, for a given indicated airspeed, true airspeed (airspeed through an air mass) and subsequently groundspeed, increases as your altitude increases. In the end you go faster for less fuel as you get higher, up to a certain altitude. Then the temperature stops dropping and you run into increased costs to keep the cabin pressurized to below 10,000 feet. IIRC, this is somewhere in the 40,000 feet range. 
There is also the matter of having a safety cushion. It really doesn't matter if a plane crashes from 5000 or 30000 feet once you hit the ground. Dead is dead. However, when something goes wrong, falling from 30000 feet gives you a lot more time to fix things than falling from 5000. It's like how ships will often avoid land in a storm - the danger zone is where sky or water meet land, so stay away from that.
"My pilot friend had this to say: ""So, turbine engines are most efficient at hotter temperature differentials.  At 33k feet it's -50 outside, and the engines are up around 600.  The lower drag coupled with the lower oxygen means lower fuel burn.""  Edit to add another comment: ""My engines (on a 737) burn around 1500 lbs per hour at idle at sea level. At cruise at 38k feet, it's around 2200"""
Winds, when they are going the right direction, are more like an added bonus than the primary reason aircraft fly high. Airlines will route aircraft to take advantage of tailwinds to some extent, but sometimes they have no choice but to fly right into 100kt+ headwinds, and they will usually do that rather than flying lower because of the reduced drag at high altitudes. Also, wind speeds tend to top out around 35k feet and actually drop off as you get up into the stratosphere.
"""more efficient"" is the wrong way to describe this, or at least it's not the turbofans that become more efficient, it's the entire vehicle becomes more efficient due to less drag on the airframe. The engines get less efficient by themselves, but it's a net-positive effect all the way up to around 45,000 ft. At those altitudes, a 500mph aircraft has the drag of a 230 mph airplane, which is 1/4 of the drag."
Case in point, for anyone wondering if this really happens: in 1985, the pilots of China Airlines flight 006 reacted incorrectly to an engine failure and allowed the thrust imbalance to turn the plane upside down. The plane fell, turning over and over, for _5.7 miles_ straight down before the pilots managed to recover and land the heavily damaged aircraft in San Francisco. No one died, but had they been flying at a lower altitude, everyone on board would have been toast.
Assuming you travel at the same speed, yes.  You have to travel faster to generate the lift.  Which is good!
The engines need oxygen to work so there's a limit to how high you can fly
Several reasons:  1. Engines require oxygen to work. At high altitudes, there is almost no oxygen. Designing an engine that can work on the ground and also at 60,000ft+ is very difficult and expensive.  2. Above approximately 60,000ft, the pressure is so low that oxygen masks would not be enough to survive if the aircraft depressurized - all the passengers would have to wear spacesuits.  3. To pressurize the inside of the plane at higher altitudes, the pressure differential between the inside and outside of the plane is greater. Since the fuselage will be under more stress, it will have to be heavier and stronger.  4. Emergency descents from higher altitudes take a much longer time.  5. At higher altitudes, solar radiation is much stronger and can increase the likelihood of skin cancer, unless you black out all the windows.  6. As you increase in altitude, the plane‚Äôs stall speed (minimum speed it can fly at) will increase. This means that the higher you fly, the faster you must fly also. Eventually, if you go high enough, the plane will have to be traveling supersonic in order to not stall. Designing planes to fly supersonic is very complicated and expensive.
Drag at 500 mph @ 45000 ft = Drag at 230 mph @ ???   Is it at sea level air?
> for 5.7 miles straight down  This didn't sound right to me so I checked but yeah [30,000 feet = 5.682 miles](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=30,000+feet+to+miles)  
Stalling at high altitude isn't much of a real safety risk, most aircraft with a well trained pilot can easily recover from a stall given enough altitude, stalling at low altitude where there's no time for recovery is infinitely more dangerous.  Stalling at pattern altitude on landing approach or shortly after takeoff is a major cause of aircraft fatalities, stalling at high altitude is almost never fatal.  As a matter of fact every student pilot will deliberately stall their aircraft at high altitude as part of their training so they become familiar with the plane's stall behavior.  The mitigation of weather related issues at higher altitudes more than makes up for the added risks.  Cabin depressurization is a rare event in an airliner.    Flying in the dense lower atmosphere would greatly limit speed, require much more power and fuel, allow much less time to react to in-flight emergencies (such as an engine out), subject the aircraft to dangerous up and down drafts when crossing mountainous areas, force aircraft to fly in bumpy choppy air, that would be uncomfortable and stress the airframe, due to convection currents from the warm earth's surface,  and crowd all air traffic (including smaller aircraft moving at much slower speeds) into a smaller space where collisions would be much more likely.
The plane was actually flying at 41,000 feet, as it was a 747 on a long-haul trans-Pacific flight. So not quite that close, but still bad. Basically, the plane was flying in cloud cover and when the plane started turning over, the pilots suffered from spatial disorientation and weren't able to figure out which way was up. When the plane dropped out of the cloud layer at 11,000 feet and they could see the horizon again, they were able to recover.
Correct. Drag increases with the Square of velocity, multiplied by the coefficient of drag. Big and bulky aircraft like airliners will have a higher coefficient of drag than a fighter jet, for example.   It's the same reason a 140hp Honda can (eventually) get up to 120mph, but it takes a super car with hundreds more hp and an aerodynamic design to get to 200mph.
This is why as a pilot in training, they teach you emergency procedures and disorientation exercises. One being wearing smoky glasses and putting your head down between your legs while the instructor moves the plane around like a crazy person until you are thoroughly confused as to which way is up. On command they will give you control of the airplane and tell you to get control of the plane. Could be straight down, sideways etc. Needless to say, it's not fun and a change of clothes is sometimes required. If you are going to get sick, this will be the time!
The main reason why it is so enforced in pilots, VFR and especially IFR, that you should pay attention to your instruments and attitude indicator.   Don't trust your senses! Don't fly by the seat of your pants. Don't rely on the outside world to guide you. Trust your instruments no matter what and you'll make it out alive without a hitch. Unless, of course, your instruments disagree with each other.      
Isn't that why they always tell you to watch and trust the instruments (artificial horizon being one)?
The engine failed first, so no failures were caused by the fall.  They kept the plane on autopilot while diagnosing it, but the autopilot wasn't set up to control the plane's rudder, so with the asymmetric thrust the plane eventually rolled and stalled.  After that it began to fall and the pilots assumed the artificial horizon had also malfunctioned as they attempted to correct the plane's plunge - because it told them it was inverted and all that.  The captain brought the remaining three engines to idle to slow the plunge, but miscommunication happened and the flight engineer didn't see this, saw the engine performance roll back to idle and attempted to get the engines back to full throttle, but the aircraft was so far out of limits that they responded slowly so he thought they'd failed.  Eventually the plane began to break up and sustained damage to it's tail from aerodynamic stresses, *but* then it came out of the clouds and the pilots were finally able to correct the fall and land,despite the damage. 
[Here's what some of that testing looks like](https://hips.hearstapps.com/pop.h-cdn.co/assets/16/02/1452895628-wing3.gif). Those wings aren't going anywhere.
When the pilots became spatially disoriented‚Äîwithout a visual reference point to determine which way was up‚Äîthe organs in the inner ear that detect their position in space stopped working properly. It became difficult for them to actual feel the plane's violent rolls and steep dive, so they thought their artificial horizons were malfunctioning.
Yes.  Without the instruments, it's very easy to be oriented incorrectly without the pilot or passengers having any physical sensation of it.  You can do a calm, controlled flight right into the ground.  For example, [JFK, Jr. and his wife died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Jr.#Death) because he was not rated for instrument flight (VFR only), but he was flying at dusk.  
This has always blown my mind - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9pvG_ZSnCc  It's pretty short, but the tl;dr; is that he rolls an aircraft without spilling his drink, and then rolls the aircraft while pouring a cup of tea.  Now imagine this video but with pitch black outside the window.  Or flat gray.  You'd experience the same 1G as that drink does, and without some external reference, it's entirely possible to go through that roll without ever realizing you're upside-down.  You know the feeling when you corner a little too fast in a car, and you can feel you're being pulled to the side?  Now black out the windows - how do you distinguish between being pulled to the side in a corner, or the vehicle being on its side?  The only difference between being pull back into your seat because you're accelerating, and being pulled back into your seat because you're flying straight upwards, so the force of gravity is coming from your back - is your trust in which direction the ground is in.  In a car, you can trust that if the wheels weren't pointing at the ground, you'd know about it by now.  In an aircraft, this trust is broken.  This is what's happening when we talk about a manoeuvre being 1G, or 2G, etc.  That the manoeuvre creates a force on you equal to one, two, etc times the force of gravity.  If that force isn't in the same direction as the floor, your butt (okay, ears) starts lying about which way the floor is.  If your eyes can't add any more reliable data to the situation, instant disorientation.
A wave is typically measured by frequency and amplitude. What aspects of gravity do these two properties affect, and are these aspects explainable/understandable to non-physicists?
I posted this on Facebook last night, and will leave it here in case anyone finds it helpful:  ---  Gravitational waves are one of the last major, unconfirmed predictions of general relativity, a theory which does a pretty amazing job of explaining gravity. General relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter. Gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around. They are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces.  But because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism, we can see light all the time (just look around!) while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly (absurdly) precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation. Rumors are flying that LIGO, just such a system of lasers and detectors, has found a gravitational wave signal, probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other (because that's the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect).  This would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there, rather than reveal something new and shocking about the Universe. Think the Higgs boson a few years ago. It would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out *not* to be there: general relativity has worked extremely well so far, and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s, which won the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. LIGO's *direct* detection would undoubtedly be Nobel-worthy, too; the only question is whether it would happen this year.  This is exciting because a) it's direct, rather than indirect, confirmation that these things are there, and b) they'll open up a whole new window onto the Universe. Pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation, from visible light to X-rays, the ultraviolet, microwaves, what have you. Starting now we'd have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos, delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes.  So all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow, ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics. Or they could just be fucking with us.
Are there any currently accepted theories that will be eventually discarded as a result ?
EDIT: Haha, I work at MIT and the professors who have to teach classes right now are really pissed, they want to watch the announcements!  As expected, there‚Äôs already quite a bit of confusion and misinformation in this megathread, so I‚Äôll try to clear things up:  &nbsp;  **What are gravitational waves?**  In order to understand gravitational waves, it‚Äôs first important to have an understanding of how forces and fields work. We‚Äôll first take a look at something more familiar - the electromagnetic field. (note: this is simplified to avoid writing a textbook):  The electromagnetic field actually consists of 2 fields: the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (B). The electric field is generated by particles with *electric charge*, such as electrons (-1 charge) and protons (+1 charge). Here‚Äôs a picture of the electric field generated by 2 such charges:  &nbsp;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_charges_plus_minus_thumb.svg  &nbsp;  As you can see in the picture, the convention is that electric field lines come *out* of positive charges and go *into* negative charges.  If you already have an E field and you put a charge in it, the charge will feel a force according to the simple relation (from Coulomb‚Äôs Law):  F = E*q  where F is the force, E is the electric field, and q is the charge. This force has a direction - for positive charges it points in the same direction as the field lines, for negative charges it points backwards (since q is negative).  Now, what does this have to do with gravitational waves? Well, let me ask you the following question: what happens if I have 2 charges, A and B, far apart from each other, and I suddenly move charge A?  1) The E field changes instantly, with charge B immediately ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the new position of charge A.  2) The E field changes first at charge A, and then the change propagates outward until charge B ‚Äúsees‚Äù the change a while later.  &nbsp;  http://i.stack.imgur.com/gA6FS.gif  &nbsp;  As you can see, the answer is 2. Changes in the electric field *radiate* outwards at a constant speed - the speed of light. In fact, this radiation IS light - our eyes are actually super-sensitive E&B field sensors that pick up these ripples and translate them into images of the world!  &nbsp;  Most importantly for our purposes, this principle of changes *radiating* outwards at the speed of light is **universal** for all fields and forces in the universe. Including gravity. The caveat being that the gravitational field is incredibly weak compared to the E&B fields, so you need to have incredibly **huge** masses moving around extremely violently, and incredibly **sensitive** detectors to pick up their movements.  The biggest masses in our universe are Black Holes. The most violent events in our universe are black holes colliding with each other. And LIGO is the incredibly sensitive detector designed to detect them!  We‚Äôre almost done! The last question is: what do we expect the gravitational waves to look like? And as a corollary, why do black holes collide in the first place?  Well, most of the black hole collisions are going to happen in binary star systems - systems where you had 2 huge stars orbiting each other that at the end of their lives become black holes, still in orbit. But why would they collide? Why not just keep orbiting forever?  Well, massive objects orbiting each other radiate gravitational waves. Those waves carry energy, and that energy has to come from somewhere - in this case, it comes from the orbital energy. So over a very long time, the orbits slowly collapse, the objects slowly orbiting closer and closer to each other. As this happens, the *orbital frequency* increases - the time it takes to complete an orbit gets shorter and shorter. This is a universal principle of gravity - if you look at our Solar System, you‚Äôll see that Mercury orbits much faster than Earth, while Pluto is much slower.  So, as 2 black holes spiral towards each other, we expect to see a **chirp** - gravitational waves increasing in frequency and intensity, rising in a final shriek as the black holes collide and merge.  &nbsp;  **What is LIGO?**  Even with black holes colliding to make gravitational waves, the ripples produced are still incredibly weak, requiring the ability to detect changes on the length scale of 1/1000th the diameter of a proton or less. So a very amazing detector is required.  LIGO is basically an extremely sensitive distance-measuring device, called an interferometer. The way this works is the following:  You start with a laser beam, then you split it into 2 equal beams (typically using a half-silvered mirror that reflects 1/2 of the beam and lets the other 1/2 through) and send them down tunnels at 90 degree angles. When they get to the end of the tunnel they get bounced back by a mirror. When the beams return to you, you recombine them into a single beam and they *interfere*. Depending on how far each beam travelled, this interference can be either *destructive* or *constructive* - meaning the beams can either cancel each other out, or they can reinforce each other and get even brighter.  At LIGO, they designed the beams so that the interference is completely destructive, meaning that no light arrives at their detector. But, when a gravitational wave comes in, it distorts spacetime, changing the lengths of the beams, and they no longer perfectly cancel out! Thus, a light signal appears at the detector.  I strongly suggest you watch the following video, which has a good visual representation of the process (around 1:30):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzZgFKoIfQI  &nbsp;  **Why is this so damn exciting?!**  So many reasons! The incredible technical achievement - measuring changes down to 1 part in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. The long-awaited confirmation of gravitational waves, which is a HUGE deal in itself. Perhaps most of all, the fact that this opens up an entirely new method of astronomy, one that ultimately will allow us to probe the most extreme densities and energies that exist in our Universe! Finally, this result gives us some confidence that we‚Äôll eventually be successful in measuring the gravitational waves of the Big Bang, and learning about the fundamental origins of the universe.  tl;dr - There are no real tl;drs in science, and why would you want one? It‚Äôs worth it to try and understand cool things like this!
For anyone still confused about what exactly gravitational waves are, [Piled Higher and Deeper (PhD Comics) has a fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GbWfNHtHRg) explaining what they are and how we can detect them.   In short, gravitational waves are produced whenever masses accelerate, changing their distortion of spacetime. Anything with mass/energy can create these waves, but since gravity is very weak only the most massive of objects produce detectable waves. We (currently) rely upon the fact that the speed of light is constant to detect gravitational waves on Earth. If a wave passes between our detectors, it will either stretch or compress the distance between two points, thus changing the total traversal time for a laser beam.  The detectors themselves are [laser interferometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry) and are large L-shaped constructions with each arm extending for 4km. The US-based LIGO project has two facilities near Livingston, LA, and Richland, WA. The detector takes advantage of the phase change a gravitational wave will cause in a laser beam. 
This event apparently released 3 solar masses worth of energy.    If that sentence sounds weird, remember E=mc^(2), which means energy and mass are interchangeable.  So to figure out how much energy that is, you have to take 3 times a solar mass (2&times;10^30 kg) and multiply it by the speed of light (300,000,000 m/s) squared, which is an awfully big number:  * 5.4&times;10^47 Joules * 1.3&times;10^41 kg or 66 billion solar masses of TNT equivalent (**A typical galaxy made out of TNT**) * 2.2&times;10^34 kg or 11,000 solar masses of thermonuclear explosive * 5000 Type 1a supernovae * 100 hypernovae  A sphere of lithium deuteride thermonuclear explosive that massive would be 36 million km across, and isn‚Äôt even capable of exploding because it is so heavy it would immediately collapse into an 11,000 solar mass black hole.  But this was a release of gravitational energy, not light, so we never saw a thing, just felt the slightest ripple when it distorted spacetime as it passed by. 
Whenever there's a scientific breakthrough, this question:  > What's the practical application?  always comes along and I hate it. So many things have been discovered and created at a time no practical application was possible and now we can't live without.  With that being said, possible practical application for this gem is marvelous. From LIGO:  > In conclusion, we will never be able to commercialize or weaponize gravitational waves themselves.  However, they will carry information to us about some of the most extreme environments in the Universe which we can use as a laboratory for environments we cannot create here on Earth.  This information can tell us more about how the physics around us works in subtle ways that can have profound implications.  What those are are yet to be seen.  That's the exciting thing about science - you never really know the full potential of new discoveries until after the fact.   EDIT: Sorry, folks. I've meant to say people that ask this question in a derisive manner. Of course, curiosity as to its practical application in real life is, of course, welcome.
They kept this really hush hush.  I have a friend that works at LIGO on theory side. He had no idea that they had measured it in September. I even asked him about it in January when whispers started up.  First confirmation he heard was a few hours ago.
Is there any concept of directionality with gravitational waves like there is with e.g. light and sound waves? If LIGO detects a disturbance, will it also be able to tell us where that disturbance originated from or are we dependent on other detectors to get that sort of information? 
So in order to make gravitational waves you need to shake something really massive really fast. In the case of two inspiraling black holes, the amplitude is related to how hard they are accelerating in their orbit, and the frequency is related to the period of the orbit.  This is why inspiraling binaries have a gravitational wave 'chirp' - as they come closer in their orbit the frequency increases as they orbit faster and faster, and the amplitude increases as well.   If a wave passes through you, it will strain you a bit, effectively squeezing and stretching you. The amount of the squeeze is related to the amplitude, the frequency of the wave is just the frequency of the squeezing. It's this tiny wavey squeezing that LIGO was designed to measure.
The idea of two black holes crashing into each other makes me feel so irrelevant. It's amazing.
> incredibly (absurdly) precise detectors  The article's description really brought it home for me:  >the sensitivity achieved by Advanced LIGO, which can detect stretches and compressions of space-time that are as small as one part in 1022 ‚Äî comparable to a hair‚Äôs-width change in the distance from the Sun to Alpha Centauri  It's amazing to me that humans can confidently detect such a small change from an event that happened 1.3 billion years ago.
No.  A direct detection will only confirm general relativity.  However, if we start seeing weird signals in the future, this may lead to modified theories of GR.  
Also, for comparison: annual world energy consumption is about 10^(20) Joules.
"The minimum wage worker wants to know ""What's in it for me?"" because he's on food stamps even though he has a full time job.  You shouldn't deride them for asking about the practical application. Imagine you ran into a homeless shelter and told everyone you discovered gravitational waves. Nobody would care because they have bigger problems.  If you want support for your science projects from everyday people then you need to talk to them in everyday language. In what way might this solve their everyday problems?"
Think sound waves - each detector cannot tell what direction the signal is coming from, but by using 2 detectors we can try to triangulate it.  Additionally, both the detectors and the sources are somewhat directional (more sensitive in some directions than others).  This helps narrow down the source, but until a 3rd or 4th detector comes online, it can't be precisely determined.
> So in order to make gravitational waves you need to shake something really massive really fast  In order to make waves, or waves we can detect?  I guess I don't understand why the waves would only exist past a certain threshold. If I drop a pebble in the ocean it makes a very small wave, but a wave nonetheless.  
Yes, but a little different from electromagnetic waves.  A gravitational wave distorts space in such a way that a circle perpendicular to the direction the wave travels gets distorted into an oval -- first compressed horizontally and elongated vertically, and then compressed vertically and elongated horizontally, and back and forth between those two situations.
"What really blew my mind was when on the press conference they told that the amount of energy released on these gravitational waves from the black holes mergin was equal to 50 times (if I remember correctly, could be wrong) the output of all the stars on ENTIRE universe. Only for 20ms though. And the energy was ""only"" equal to complete annihilation of 3 stars the size of the sun.   It happened 1.3 billion lightyears away, and yet we could still detect it here on earth. It'd be really interesting to know what kind of effects the gravitational waves would have on for example earth, if this would have happened 1 lightyear away and if we'd ignore all the other apocalyptic stuff propably occuring. Would it be bit like some kind of uniform earthquakelike occurence, or would we simply warp a bit without ever realizing that anything special happened?"
Which article was that? 1 part in 1022 seems much, much bigger than a hair's-width change in the distance from the Sun to Alpha Centauri. Mistake in the copy-and-paste?  Edit: Ah, I watched the PhD Comic's video and it quoted 10^23. So just a mistake in the superscript.
It's quite mind blowing that GR correctly predicted things we can verify only 100 years later.
To those who become confused by this, remember that 10^20 is not half of 10^40 , but instead only has half as many trailing zero's. This means that 10^40 is in fact 100 quintillion (short scale) or 100 trillion (long scale) times larger than 10^20.
Ones that we can reasonably detect.
"Astounding. The Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment was done in 1887 to try and detect the differences in the speed of light in perpendicular directions, in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether (""aether wind""). In 1905, Einstein published a paper first bringing up time dilation, which takes the speed of light as constant and deduces some weird shit that reality should conform to. During 1907-1915 he develops General Relativity, which explains how gravity plays into this. And now, in 2016, a 100 years later; the dude's scientific deductions are still coming true in exciting ways. And, hilariously, the idea of looking at light going in perpendicular directions is again the experiment being done, except with an entirely different outlook on what is expected. What's ironic is we can look at this now as ""listening"" to the ""ether""."
Amazing, but also quite common in physics.  Another example would be when Paul Dirac predicted the existence of the anti-electron only using mathematics. 
Thank you.
the original rush to alchemy was done in the belief that we could turn lead into gold and other such hogwash  except that, as a consequence of the long term scientific effort at real chemistry and then beyond into nuclear physics, we can actually do that today:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesis_of_precious_metals  (completely financially infeasible though)  given long enough time, science becomes the magic it debunks 
"I believe this is postulate 3 of [Clarke's Three Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws):  "" The three laws are typically formulated as follows:  **Clarke's first law** When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.  **Clarke's second law** The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.  **Clarke's third law** Any sufficiently advanced technology is *indistinguishable from magic*. """
This isn't a fortune teller flipping a coin and telling that tomorrow is the end of the world. This is specialists taking in account all the mathematical and experimental bases we have for current physics and developing all the possibilities step by step in a logical, mathematically proven way. All the prediction have to be this way, so they cannot just say anything.   If this kind of prediction fails it isn't because it's a random thing, but because there's some kind of hidden variable or a poorly understood property or concept that needs a revision. And, in fact, that's the coolest thing that it can happen because we need go deeper and change things upside-down to get an even preciser theory. 
That would be so cool, if we could eventually get gravimetric radars. No stealth possible for objects over a certain mass. This would have big repercussion in military aviation and also in astronomy I'm sure since we could detect objects without having to rely on the EM spectrum. Depending on sensibility of this, I could see application in meteorology also.   Edit: astronomy > astrology
As a flood engineer i wish i came here sooner to answer a few questions.   But the main thing is that a number of vectors will remove the water due to gravity.   Namely sewers, ground drains, good old evaporation, lay of the land, local ground geology, tidal differences to name a few.  Once the hurricane has passed though then levels will drop fairly quickly.  The biggest problem will be both the environmental (mobilised sewage etc...) and physical property damage that has occured.  Lots of standing water means mozzies and vermin.  Contaminated waters means polluted ground water sources, damaged agriculture infrastructure, dead livestock, crops wiped out and quarantined/destroyed  (certain crops absorb harmful nasties).   Infrastructure wise lots of work gutting out the drainage system and clearing hurricane damage will take place. Damaged electricity/phone/gas infrastructure will need checking too.    Now let's talk about the houses that are damaged.   There are typical damage assessments that can be done but there are 2 typical factors that ultimately determine damage costs and severity - the depth of water and the time water stays around (ok and type of building materials used)  Anything typically above 400mm for a day or 2 means that the lower floor needs gutting and requires a complete rework.  Now think of this in terms of demands locally.  Every homeless person will  need rehousing, every house will require skilled trades to repair them(and they WILL be in  demand). It will take years for all affected properties to be repaired by all trades.  But as a starter for then why not google what happened during hurricane katrina or the 2005 flooding carlisle in the UK.  Some of the stats are just mindblowing and heartbreaking.  Ps also google the lake levels rises during hurricane Katrina due to the low air pressure alone.  It makes for amazing reading.

"I'm a semester away from graduating with a degree in soil science, so I'll answer this as it pertains to soil.  The most important concept to understand before I delve into this is that everything moves through soil via water. This includes nutrients, pollutants, minerals, etc.  The large scale scope of a flood like this is pollution and soil erosion. When soil is flooded to the point that water can no longer infiltrate, it begins transporting the top 2 layers of soil. This is the organic layer (such as leaf litter) and the surface layer (topsoil). These are the two most nutrient rich layers of soil, and often the most polluted (by pesticides, foreign chemicals, or trash). This is not good for a few reasons:  1. The main source of nutrients have now been stripped from the plants.  2. The sub-surface layers are exposed, and from what I understand about Texan soil, this is mostly clay.  3. Pollutants are now being transported and dumped into waterways or varying soil environments.   Some of the nutrients will be returned to soil elsewhere, but most of these nutrients will flow to waterways and into the ocean. This will not be good for the Gulf, as it is already hypoxic (lack of dissolved oxygen due to nutrient runoff. Essentially, the large amount of nutrients results in algae blooms which deprives the water of oxygen). The reduction of plant matter will also reduce the stability of the soil, meaning it will be more likely to erode in the future.   The second portion of this is that clay now becomes the surface layer. Because clay is so small, it takes water significantly longer to move through the soil profile, thus lowering the hydraulic conductivity. This means water runoff will now become a large problem in the affected areas for months or years to come.  The third portion is pollutants. Chemicals and trash are now being transported to different soils and waterways. Not good.  As for the smaller scope impacts, soil horizons will become disrupted. Soil stability will be negatively impacted. Nutrients will be forced through the horizons quicker, leaving a deprived soil. Many soil microbes (the most important indicator of soil health, depending on who you ask) will be killed off.  So, yeah. It's disastrous for soil and the overall environmental health of the area.  EDIT: Also, as for plants, many can survive being submerged for up to a weekish. Many cannot. The flooding will inhibit root nutrient uptake, which will result in decay. Water-logged roots are also more susceptible to organisms that specialize in root-rot.        EDIT2: /u/BadBadger42 asked a question about highly expansive clays. These are what we call shrink-swell soils. The clay fraction is expanded in area when water-logged, which causes extra stress on infrastructure. This is the leading cause of flooding basements, and why many buildings in Texas do not have basements. Taking a look at [this soil map of Texas](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/nrcs144p2_000979.jpg), most of the area effected is Vertisol. I'm sure you've all noticed a vertisol before, when it dries it looks like [this](http://geotechfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cracked-soil-texas.jpg). The ""swell"" of the soil is caused by the micropores between the clay particles becoming over-saturated - and when it dries (""shrinks"") those cracks are left behind. Vertisol is the shrink-swell classification of soil. I would imagine that the effects of shrink-swell on infrastructure will be exacerbated by the flooding.  "
I'm a Professional Engineer in Pennsylvania who consults in stormwater management.  Q1: Water will recede just like any other storm, it will just take MUCH longer. In an urban setting like Houston, it will flow into storm drains along the curb, into small pipes like 18‚Äù diameter, then those feed into larger pipes like 48‚Äù or even concrete box culverts which might be 15‚Äô wide by 4‚Äô high (the possible dimensions are endless). Those large pipes/culverts drain into the streams and rivers. Everything eventually keeps draining downhill to the ocean, bay, bayou, etc.   Q2: In general, this probably won‚Äôt change much regarding the landscape. It will look like the same place as it did before, except structures around main drainage channels may have washed away.  Q3: No permanent lakes or rivers will be made. Everything will drain naturally in a matter of days. If there is a low spot that doesn‚Äôt drain by gravity to a storm sewer, channel, stream, etc., that depression could hold water longer but it will eventually infiltrate into the soil and/or evaporate.  Up here in Pennsylvania, we design pipes/culverts to carry up to the 100-year storm which would be like 8‚Äù of rain in 24 hours. Not sure what they design for down south, but their 100-year storm is probably like 12‚Äù+ of rain in 24 hours. This hurricane is dumping 4+ feet in some areas so there‚Äôs no way to drain that much water very quickly. Just have to wait.
I Googled this yesterday cause I was afraid to ask on here. I am curious of the actual paths it takes to get to the gulf. The only thing I can imagine is how a tsunami rapidly recedes back to the ocean but I know that isn't how this works. 
I would like to piggyback on this question if I could...  Would draining the 2 reservoirs they're having problems with (the Addicks and Barker) before the hurricane hit not have kept the water out of the Bayou and out of those neighborhoods close by?  Why would they not have done this beforehand?

Differences in atmospheric pressure DO NOT appreciably contribute to storm surge.  Storm surge is wind-driven water.  What makes it bad/worse is the shape of the continental shelf (whereas shallow = bad) and also the rise in elevation of the adjacent coastal land (how much elevation per mile as you go inland.)  [Here, read up everyone.](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/surge_intro.pdf)  Pay special attention to page 2, upper left.  Source: Am a physical geographer specializing in tropical cyclone meteorology and climatology, and fluvial/littoral geomorphology as well as being a mediocre googler.  edit: I generally don't intervene, but I wanted to set things straight on the pressure/surge stuff since that seems to be a popular misconception. u/mitchanium, excellent post otherwise!
I don't want to be rude, but what made you decide that you want to be a soil scientists?
"For what has been dubbed as the ""Gulf of Mexico dead zone"", it's a bit of a mixed bag in terms of how storm-related freshwater inflow from the Mississippi plume (and some influence from the Atchaflaya and other rivers) impacts these hypoxic/anoxic conditions. During the summer, it has been observed that disruptive storms (i.e., hurricanes) do a pretty good job at mixing the water column and breaking up stratification (a principle component for the development of the dead zone); this mixing appears to have lingering effects by drastically reducing the size of the dead zone even after stratification re-emerges. Conversely, these winds may enhance upwelling- and downwelling-favorable conditions that simply shift the location and shape of the dead zone and not help to alleviate it at all.   Another interesting component in all of this is the probable shift in species distribution of phytoplankton; the silica-rich freshwater inflow would replenish a Si-limited system and allow silicifying algae (e.g., diatoms) to bloom again (as opposed to dinoflagellates and other phytoplankton that are commonly associated with harmful blooms). What is interesting (and somewhat cool if not for the hypoxia) is that this has pretty substantial biological, chemical, and geological consequences in both short- (intra-year) and long-term (decadal or more) time-scales.

Basically. Water is gonna follow gravity to the lowest spot. The lowest spot could be a pond, lake, or, for the majority of water, the ocean. Water will follow rivers and gullies until it reaches the ocean/lake/whatever the low spot is.  Problem with a hurricane is the storm surge, which forces the ocean to rise into the coastline. I know the shear wind force can push it but there may be other factors (for reference, put water on a plate and blow on it. It will move towards the area you blow). So the ocean, where the rainwater normally flows, is now several feet higher, meaning those rivers/streams/gullies are going to stop flowing once they reach equilibrium with the ocean.
They completely drained them before the storm. They aren't for water storage, only flood control. There was so much rain that they filled up.  They were empty as of August 23rd: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?cb_00054=on&cb_62615=on&cb_62615=on&format=gif_default&site_no=08073000&period=&begin_date=2017-08-16&end_date=2017-08-30 
I believe you want to look into the storm surge. The section labeled [The Storm Surge and Flooding of New Orleans](https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html) is an example of what mitchanium mentioned.   Reading that section says not all that height is air pressure alone, some of it is water pushed by wind and the result of water pushed into enclosed spaces, but the [model](https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html) shows something like 10-12 feet of water on the southern shore of the lake. Whether it was just air pressure of a combination of that and wind, that is still a wall of water created by nothing more than the movement of air.  
Honestly it's mainly the lay of the land thay dictates where the water will go.  By that i mean that if land contours or people  prevent flooding to that area then that inevitably means flooding somehwere else.  The reality though is that most areas are only protected to a certain degree (and economically justified {cost benefit analysis} projects) and most are reactively responded to as opposed to proactively responded to.  Now don't roast your local government or council for lack of action because the world really has been impacted by global warming.  Eg for any business case or flood scheme that i propose in the UK i have to factor in  20% additional damage due to climate change.....and trust me storm intensities have got worse here.   It's crazy times folks. 
I saw either an article or another post on Reddit somewhere that over the last 20 or so years, Houston has been improving its water drainage system by creating storm drains under any new road construction. The system helps divert water away from homes and instead floods the streets (since it is safer there). Those incredible pictures from Houston interstates are at least partly a result of that flood control system. It is also a reason why they did not issue an evacuation order, because people would be sitting in traffic while the water rose, resulting in unnecessary deaths.

"Bad news is starting to get out, unfortunately. The local environmental justice org TEJAS and Sierra Club have an early rundown: http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2017/08/least-10-houston-area-chemical-facilities-and-oil-and-gas-refineries-have  Corpus Christi has experienced several chemical leaks, some on purpose. Flaring off large amounts of gases is part of shutting down refinery operations, but it's not pretty. The Valero refinery had a flare so large that nearby residents called the fire department. https://patch.com/us/across-america/huge-flaring-corpus-christi-refinery-sparked-power-outage  And Koch Industries (Flint Hills Resources) refinery in Corpus Christi was flaring benzene last Friday, as it shut down: https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060059445  Farther north, the greater Houston region is having several serious problems at various petrochemical facilities, where flooding was/is much worse. Companies have disclosed 2 million lbs of chemical releases to TX government: http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/29/hurricane-harvey-chemical-danger-242142  The Arkima industrial chemical facility in Crosby TX is in danger of a serious fire or explosion. The manufacturing process involves keeping certain chemicals at very low temperatures, just below freezing, but the plant has been without power for days and at the moment is still inundated with water: https://www.wsj.com/articles/arkema-warns-it-cant-prevent-potential-chemical-explosion-in-texas-1504124326  Exxon and Valero both reported releases of carcinogens, specifically benzene and toluene. Lightning struck a Dow Chemical plant and set off a benzene leak. And Flint Hills flared benzene, see above.  Days ago, people in the Houston area reported acrid smells in the air.

Flaring can be very dangerous, and this crisis is demonstrating how much (extra) pollution is created when refineries shut down in a ""controlled"" situation: https://qz.com/1066097/hurricane-harvey-oil-refineries-are-polluting-latino-and-low-income-neighborhoods/  As Quartz notes, and community advocates on the ground have stressed, all of this pollution, on top of the rain, floods and storm, tends to hit low income refinery communities the hardest. Many of those communities are majority people of color. And while the storm doesn't discriminate, some aspects of the petrochemical and real estate economies clearly do.   The Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst has a helpful annual ranking of air, water & climate pollution, down to the individual facilities and community demographics: https://www.peri.umass.edu/top-100-polluter-indexes  For all of these reasons and more, I appreciate the organizations listed here that are all working on rescue and recovery operations in Texas right now.

Lol. Thats not rude at all. I get this question more times than you can imagine.   My interest in soil started when I was a kid. I loved digging. I loved looking at all the critters scramble about when I dug them up. I liked the different colors I found in the ground when I was on family vacations.  But I never took it as a serious desire until college. I was going to be a civil engineer until I took an intro to soil science course. I quickly realized I loved how all of the sciences are incorporated into it - soil physics, soil chemistry, and soil biology are all equally important.   I guess it's hard to explain why I enjoy it so much. If you like lab work, you can do lab work with soil. If you enjoy being in the field, you can do field work with soil. It reaches into more areas of study than I previously imagined. Agriculture, hydrology, landscape management, engineering, and urban design just to name a few. 
This link is outstanding. Thank you for sharing.
Fascinating. So the hurricane basically takes water from a lake and then drops it over Houston? 
I'm amazed (and a bit jealous) about how you found your passion in something that the vast majority of people wouldn't spare a second thought for. Good for you sir!
Not really. It causes lakes to bulge upward because there's not as much air pressure acting on the water, just gravity. Essentailly, the water spreads out vertically.  A really bad example that still gets the point across is putting a peep in a vacuum chamber. Except instead of marshmallow, it's water that can still flow.
There are lots of different jobs you can do, lots of different options for careers.  The challenge is to make yourself into the kind of person that can bring their passion to the job that needs to be done. Almost any job can be rewarding if you push harder, seek out opportunities for improvement, and... dare I say it... dig deeper.
The density of the water remains pretty much unchanged from the change in pressure. Water is often considered incompressible because no naturally occuring pressure differentiall will cause water to expand to a significant degree. What will change is the actual mass of water in the lake. The pressure will draw more water to the low pressure area if the lake is connected to another body of water, the ocean in the case of katrina or from the other side of the lake of it is big enough. This is like sucking water through a straw. The water moves up the straw but drains it from another source. Also, regardless of whether not the lake is attached to another source, the water will go up simply because the low air pressure means there can be less water vapor pressure (dryer air). So the air outside of the eye is very wet (obviously) but the air in the eye is not. The decreased pressure means thinner air and thinner air cannot store as much gaseous water. So the air that was previously very humid in the higher pressure areas can no longer hold all of its water resulting in the water vapor condensing back into a liquid. This isn't on the scale of rain, but enough to contribute towards the amount of water in a lake.
The nose is actually an organ that performs many functions aside from just being a conduit to the respiratory and olfactory system.  The nose warms up and moistens  air before it enters the trachea in the winter and has an air conditioning effect in the summer.  The nose is the first line of defense before foreign particles can be inhaled into the respiratory tract ‚Äì large particles are captured by hairs and smaller ones get caught in mucus.  In that way, it can be thought of as an organ of the immune system, since it is responsible for draining the sinuses.  The endings of the olfactory nerves go through the roof of the nasal cavity; if there was no protection and just open orifices on the front of the face, you would basically have very little between raw exposed cranial nerve endings and the outside world.  Lastly, the shape of the nose changes vocal resonance and affects your voice.  Edit:  Wow, leaving for a few hours, you wouldn't expect a little comment about the nose to blow up like this, or else I would've elaborated more.  I did a little lower down, going into more detail on theories of racial/climate-related differences in nose shape and comparative anatomy of other animal noses (carotid rete).  I also agree that noses are not usually classified as immune system organs, but I just meant that it has functions with innate immunity.  And good point on helping to keep liquids out of the respiratory tract!
In addition to what everyone else said there is one point that no one brought up: The shape of a human nose helps infants breathe while suckling. Other primates have protruding jaws that allow them to breathe while suckling. If we didn't have our noses we could be more prone to smothering. 
Protection from rain.  Many animals have heads that point down, but with our large brains, we're not designed for that.  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2015/oct/05/sneezing-monkey-walking-fish-200-new-species-himalayas  Locals have told scientists the monkeys are easy to find because, owing to their upturned noses, water gets into their nostrils when it rains and they start sneezing. On rainy days, they sit with their heads tucked between their legs to stop the water getting up their noses.
Every time this comes up, I mention the benefits of a hooded nose for swimming, but it's shot down. I get that it humidifies air for us and all that, but is there not at least something to the fact that we can go underwater while other primates can't?  Other primates have open noses, and I don't know if they live with constant respiratory issues, but I know they aren't into swimming like humans.
In addition to what everyone has said, the nose plays a big role in taste, too. We can smell our food better with the nostrils right above our mouth and better detect potentially harmful (rotting or poisonous) food. 
I think you may have missed mentioning the most obvious reason. The nose primarily functions to keep water out of the respiratory passages. We can't close our nose like we can our mouth, but the shape of the nose, the position and size of the nostrils, and nostril hairs themselves (which are hydrophobic), all serve to block water from entering the nasal passages.
So why isn't it just two holes in the face, and internal like animals that tend to have a far better smell than us anyway?  Lots of great info but it doesn't really answer the questions about why it is shaped the way it is.
It works for adults too!  If your nose was just two holes and you ended up pressing your face against something while you slept (such as a pillow, a leaf, or your mate or child), you might suffocate.  As it is, the shape of your nose keeps the area around your nostrils clear even when pressed against an object, helping you breath.
Snub-nosed monkeys have problems with rain getting in their flat faces so they sneeze a lot during storms.
Here's the real question; why didn't we develop the ability to close our noses? We seemed to have managed every other convenience.
"Speech language pathologist here: your nose does not affect the deepness of your voice! That is based on the muscles of your larynx and the prominence of your ""Adam's apple."" Your nose affects your resonance - when you are sick, it sounds like no air is coming through your nose. When someone sounds super nasal, it's because too much air is coming through your nose.   The deepness of voice = thick vocal fold muscles The nose= resonance (hypo/hypernasality)"
They have snouts that serve the same function as our noses, creating a similar nasal cavity.
Not really answering your question, but a quick yet important tidbit about evolution:  There is no goal for evolution, and it doesn't always produce the best and the most efficient feature in animals. Evolution occurs when random mutations help an organism or a species to survive better and reproduce. It need not be a step forward in all the characteristics of the animal, just the necessary ones that help it survive it's immediate surroundings. Also, a marginal step forward in one characteristic may itself provide a huge *net gain* in advantage for survivability and reproducibility, in spite of regression in certain other characteristics.
Actually, racial differences have been studied pretty specifically pertaining to nose shape [since the 1800s](http://www.popsci.com/climate-nose-shape-evolution#page-6).  There has definitely been a correlation between flatter, broader noses and equatorial climates, and narrower, longer noses at higher latitudes.  [This study](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006616), for example, controls for genetic drift and found statistically significant differences in nose shape across cultures, varying directly with temperature and absolute humidity.  The [theory](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-shape-of-a-nose/) on this is that narrow chambers are better at insulating the air that is exchanged and warming it up, whereas broader chambers facilitate more open surface contact with greater volumes of air, allowing for more efficient cooling.
Kinda like the shape of your eye sockets with the eyeball recessed reduces the likelihood of trauma.
Evolution [selects](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_25) for whatever trait that works well enough to ensure differential reproduction, not necessarily for the best trait. Our current nose works well-enough. This implies no value judgment on whether closing our noses would have been better or worse. 
Actually, from a design point of view, our bodies are not that well constructed. Our spine isn't really made for walking upright, for one. The way the nerves branch out from between vertebrae makes them extremely vulnerable to compression.  Similarly, our head is just one big point of failure. If anything happens to it, we're toast. GG, centralized nervous system.  Our circulatory system? It depends on us nearly constantly moving to function. Ever notice that when you have to sit for a while, your feet get a little sore and you wind up fidgeting‚Äã? That's because if you don't keep your muscles moving, your circulation stops. Those little movements (toes wriggling, feet shifting, etc) are what pump your blood back up to your heart.  All of it works *well enough*, but it's far from well designed. More like cobbled together and functional.
>  This implies no value judgment on whether closing our noses would have been better or worse.  Or that we just weren't lucky and didn't have that mutation. Or that while trait might've been beneficial, it wasn't beneficial enough and randomly didn't survive.
Like the rest of evolution, just because one branch of life hasn't evolved it yet doesn't mean they had plenty of time and just chose not to. Just means their environment never called for it and they never stopped reproducing a dominant mutation, even if it isn't the most perfect.
Hopefully your ballsack has a bunch of pain receptors so you try to prevent them from getting hurt.
Human mammary glands aren't swollen - we just have fat stored behind them. When a woman is pregnant, breastfeeding or on a hormonal contraceptive that simulates pregnancy they do swell up and bra size can go up _significantly_.
Or that it might have been extremely beneficial but occurred at the wrong place or time... Evolution is a very random process.
It's clear why this trait emerged: People who can't reproduce are disqualified from the evolutionary race just as surely as if they were dead. That's why ~50% of us walk around dreading being kicked in the balls.
I have a weird thing about compressed stuff tanks and my balls. I never had anything explode near my testicles but one day I got the thought in my head of lighters/spray deodorant/oxygen tanks exploding and shooting metal fragments into my balls. This thought process happens pretty much any time I'm near something like that. 
Mine just retreated back into the fort with just the mental image you provided.
"No, it is not.  Phones and other devices that broadcast (tablets, laptops, you name it ...) emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation. EM radiation comes in many different forms, but it is typically characterized by its frequency (or wavelength, the two are directly connected).  Most mobile devices communicate with EM signals in the frequency range running from a few hundred megahertz (MHz) to a few gigahertz (GHz).  So what happens when we're hit with EM radiation? Well, it depends on the frequency. The frequency of the radiation determines the energy of the individual photons that make up the radiation. Higher frequency = higher energy photons. If photons have sufficiently high energy, they can damage a molecule and, by extension, a cell in your body. There's no exact frequency threshold from which point on EM radiation can cause damage in this way, but 1 petahertz (PHz, or 1,000,000 GHz) is a good rough estimate. For photons that don't have this much energy, the most they can hope to achieve is to see their energy converted into heat.  Converting EM radiation into a heat is the #1 activity of a very popular kitchen appliance: The microwave oven. This device emits EM radiation with a frequency of about 2.4 GHz to heat your milk and burn your noodles (while leaving parts of the meal suspiciously cold).  The attentive reader should now say to themselves: Wait a minute! This 2.4 GHz of the microwave oven is right there between the ""few hundred MHz"" and ""few GHz"" frequency range of our mobile devices. So are our devices mini-microwave ovens?  As it turns out, 2.4 GHz is also the frequency used by many wifi routers (and devices connecting to them) (which coincidentally is the reason why poorly shielded microwave ovens can cause dropped wifi connections when active). But this is where the second important variable that determines the effects of EM radiation comes into play: intensity.  A microwave oven operates with a power of somewhere around the 1,000 W (depending on the model), whereas a router has a broadcast power that is limited (by law, in most countries) to 0.1 W. That makes a microwave oven 10,000 more powerful than a wifi router at maximum output. And mobile devices typically broadcast at even lower intensities, to conserve battery. And while microwave ovens are designed to focus their radiation on a small volume in the interior of the oven, routers and mobile devices throw their radiation out in every direction.  So, not only is EM radiation emitted by our devices not energetic enough to cause direct damage, the intensity with which it is emitted is orders of magnitude lower to cause any noticeable heating.  But to close, I would like to discuss one more source of EM radiation. A source from which we receive radiation with frequencies ranging from 100 terahertz (THz) to 1 PHz or even slightly more. Yes, that overlaps with the range of potentially damaging radiation. And even more, the intensity of this radiation varies, but can reach up to tens of W. That's not the total emitted, but the total that directly reaches a human being. Not quite microwave oven level, but enough to make you feel much hotter when exposed to it.  So what is this source of EM radiation and why isn't it banned yet? The source is none other than the Sun. (And it's probably not yet banned due to the powerful agricultural lobby.) Our Sun blasts us with radiation that is far more energetic (to the point where it can be damaging) than anything our devices produce and with far greater intensity. Even indoors, behind a window, you'll receive so much more energy from the Sun (directly or indirectly when reflected by the sky or various objects) than you do from the ensemble of our mobile devices."
Here‚Äôs a handy chart from Randall Munroe (XKCD): https://xkcd.com/radiation/  You may notice that cell phones and other tech are not on this chart. This is because the radiation emitted by these devices is so weak, they are not capable of altering your cells (non-ionizing radiation). Bananas, on the other hand, do emit ionizing radiation (just a very, very, very small amount. You do not need to be worried about bananas). So you might explain to your parents that bananas are more dangerous than cell phones, and ask them if they know anyone who has died suspiciously after eating a couple bananas
I feel like the whole picture hasn't been conveyed in the top comments as certain studies have found a slight correlation between the non-ionizing radiation emitted by cell phones and certain types of brain tumors. The majority of studies have shown no such correlation or a statistically inconclusive correlation. The problem with any research on this issue, as far as I understand, is that the span in which people have been heavily using cell phones is relatively short in comparison to a human lifespan. In any case, the issue isn't done and dusted and a great deal of research will be conducted on the subject as cell phone users age.  Here is a somewhat technical source that does a very good job of summing research into the issue, and also links to the few studies favoring increased risk: [https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/exposure-assessment/cellular-telephones-brain-tumors](https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/exposure-assessment/cellular-telephones-brain-tumors)  Here is a less technical fact sheet on the issue with some Q&A your parents might appreciate: [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet)  Edited for word choice on the controversial bit  Also, I certainly wouldn't stop using a cell phone over this - just wanted to point out an applicable research area that hasn't been pointed out by other commenters. 
"No. Most evidence says it isn't true.  Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic (EM) radiation and the term ""radiation"" scares a lot of people, but EM radiation also includes the heat from the sun, visible light, radio waves, and x-rays. Some of these are more dangerous than others. In a lot of cases people in medicine and physics talk about ""ionizing"" and ""non-ionizing"" radiation. ""Ionizing"" radiation means that it can knock an election lose (making an ""ion"") and break a chemical bond. Since our DNA is a large molecule this type of radiation can change the structure of DNA and create errors in the DNA which can cause cancer. Non-ionizing radiation can't do this. Radio waves, and visible light are all lower energy non-ionizing radiation, while ultra violet light and x-rays are ionizing radiation.  Now, having said that, obviously enough heat will cause burns. Microwaves are non-ionizing, but enough of them can boil water and cook meat, so it isn't enough to just say that ""non-ionizing"" means that it's safe. Now a microwave oven produces 500-1000 watts of EM radiation, while a cell phone produces at most 0.7-1 watt (some old ones could go up to 3 watts, but in practice cell phones try to send a weaker signal to conserve battery life, so even the 0.7 watt is very rare). A 1000 watt light bulb will really hurt your eyes while a 1 watt bulb isn't enough to read by, and it's a similar for cell phone -- very low power doesn't appear to be a concern.  Now, one other problem is that In addition to the strong chemical bonds (e.g. ionic and covalent), there are also weaker bonds (e.g. hydrogen bonds) that don't actually require ionizing radiation to break them. Now breaking a hydrogen bond in DNA doesn't change the structure, but it can unzip the DNA, and cause different genes to be expressed. Every cell in your body has the same DNA, but your liver and your skin cells read different parts of the DNA so they make different proteins, which means they look and act differently. Some non-ionizing radiation can affect this (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633881/) and while this is the same general range as the airport body scanners, the scanners probably don't provide enough energy or for long enough to show this effect. However, some of the new 5G cell phones, and some high-speed wireless (that some phone companies are rolling out to simplify connecting new houses, not the normal WiFi), also use similar EM energies and they would involve much longer exposure times so should probably be studied better.  For a long time there was concern about living near high voltage power lines, since they also produce EM radiation (of the non-ionizing type). It turns out that people who live under power lines get cancer more often, but when this was analysed more carefully, the problem is that poor people tend to live under power lines and poor people tend to get cancer more often. We still don't know exactly why poor people tend to get cancer more -- it could be don't know if this is this is due to stress, food, chemicals from clothes, or less access to health care, but we're now sure that it isn't due to the power lines).  Nothing is absolutely, provably, safe in all cases, and it is worth continuing to examine new technologies, but as far as wee can tell there's more danger from not getting enough sleep due to staying up playing on your phone than there is from the radiation from the phone."
No. They are just trying to keep you away from your phone.  There has been a famous test that was as follows: They asked people who said radiation emmited by radio towers, TVs... had bad effect on their health to move to a location where there is absolutely no radiation. They moved there and said that they were feeling much better. Later they found out that there were no radio towers there because a gigantic radio tower was built there that was used to send signals to space and they didn't want any interference from the sorrounding commercial towers. This towers emmited way more radio signals so it turned out it didn't matter how much radiation there was. People were just lying.
Thank you very much for such a detailed answer :D
> agricultural lobby.  Big Farma back at it.   Real question though if I increased the voltage going to my router by a factor of 10 (1W vs 0.1W) assuming I cooled the router effectively, would that result in better wifi coverage in my house?  
I have a question about this.  Why do we bother with shielding our other body parts during X-rays, if the damage is so minimal? If a 6 hour flight is 40 times as damaging as an arm X-ray, isn't it all a bit unnecessary?   From a different perspective, shouldn't we be doing more to protect ourselves on flights, if the medical consensus is that X-rays are harmful? I can understand that lead vests for passengers are inefficient in many ways, but what about cabin crew, who fly constantly?  
Not necessarily *lying* per se, remember, the placebo (and nocebo) effect is surprisingly powerful
"The big fuss is that when people say ""radiation"" they are conflating anything that emits/radiates energy (i.e. anything but the cold vacuum of space) with ""ionizing radiation""  - x-rays and gamma rays. The normal stuff like light, infrared, UV, radio is so common and harmless, we don't think of it as radiation, except when speaking scientifically.   The reason ionizing radiation is dangerous is that high concentrations of ionizing radiation are so powerful they penetrate all but the most dense matter (ex. lead). Ionizing radiation has so much energy, when it's traveling through matter, it smashes through it, breaking apart molecular bonds. When these molecular bonds are in your DNA, your DNA can get messed up and that cell in you body won't function properly any more. A few cells here and there, your body can handle, the cells self-destruct or are otherwise cleaned up. But if too many get messed up DNA, they get out of control, these cells run amok. We call that cancer.  [Also, here's a handy chart from XKCD explaining the scale and levels of dangerous ionizing radiation.](https://xkcd.com/radiation/)"
You've got an excellent answer there but if you need more reassurance then you might like to know that the effects of these frequencies of radiation (and mobile phones in general) on the body are being actively studied. I'm taking part in an international study called [Cosmos](http://www.ukcosmos.org/) which is tracking the health of thousands of people to try to determine if there is any long term effects that are not immediately obvious. When the study was started the assumption was that there would be no effects to radiation of this power level and frequency range but it had never been studied in detail for extended periods of time and there was a media frenzy about mobile phones causing health damage (which makes funding easy to get).  I forget how long the study has been going now but it's many years. There was an interim report a couple of years ago and, as expected, no ill effects were found. IIRC the study is scheduled to run for 40 years so I'll be an old man by the time it ends.
No it would make it worse. It's the equivalent of using a megaphone to try to have a conversation. Everyone else is now deaf and you can't hear over yourself. (This is just an analogy, the real problems are way to technical to explain via cell keyboard)
Most answers focus on a more hypothetical case; practically, the components of your router such as DC-DC converters and capacitors are likely not rated for that use and will be destroyed. The mostly likely result is turning your router into a brick, which will decrease your WiFi coverage.
"For technicians, it often adds up to a meaningful number and using PPE to block a third or so of the exposure makes a lot of sense.  Then there are some particularly vulnerable parts of the body‚Äîlooking at you, ya damn thyroid‚Äîwhere minimizing exposure is always a good idea.  But beyond that...  For patients, there's not much of a reason outside of guarding against rare (practically unheard of?) malfunctions. OK, there's one other: to get the patient to shut up. Seriously, after having conversations with several dentists and their techs about the idiotic conversations they endure around x-rays, flouride, cancer screenings, and any number of other things, it's a pretty easy ""yes please"" to just throw the apron on.  https://www.iaea.org/resources/rpop/health-professionals/dentistry/patients   >**Should patients and carers wear lead aprons and personal protective devices during a dental radiographic procedure?**  >With well-designed and optimized equipment and procedures there is no need for routine use of lead aprons for the patient in dental radiology. Lead aprons may provide some protection in the rare case of the vertex occlusal examination, especially in a patient who is, or may be, pregnant. On the other hand, the use of a lead apron may reassure patients that every effort is being made to ensure their safety, and may reduce the amount of time that needs to be taken to reassure them. Certainly, a lead apron should be provided for any patient who requests one. It may also be advisable to consider using them on a cautionary basis where equipment and/or technique have not been verified by a radiation protection specialist, and where they will not otherwise interfere with the examination. Thyroid collars should be used in all examinations where the thyroid may be exposed to the main beam or to a considerable amount of scatter radiation.  >Lead aprons must be provided for a person who is required to support a patient during the radiographic procedure (i.e., a comforter or carer). Assisting adults should be positioned so that all parts of their body are out of the main beam.  "
Small clarification here: The threshold for ionizing radiation is typically placed in the middle of the UV spectrum. This is why UV is often broken up into UVA, UVB, and UVC categories, with increasing levels of skin cancer risk. 
> UVA, UVB, and UVC categories   [Penetration factor](https://www.who.int/uv/faq/whatisuv/en/index2.html)    UVC doesn't penetrate our atmosphere, UVB doesn't penetrate past our skin surface, UVA goes deep into the skin.  >Short-wavelength UVC is the most damaging type of UV radiation. However, it is completely filtered by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth's surface.  >Medium-wavelength UVB is very biologically active but cannot penetrate beyond the superficial skin layers. It is responsible for delayed tanning and burning; in addition to these short-term effects it enhances skin ageing and significantly promotes the development of skin cancer. Most solar UVB is filtered by the atmosphere.  >The relatively long-wavelength UVA accounts for approximately 95 per cent of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. It can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and is responsible for the immediate tanning effect. Furthermore, it also contributes to skin ageing and wrinkling. For a long time it was thought that UVA could not cause any lasting damage. Recent studies strongly suggest that it may also enhance the development of skin cancers.
Yes, in fact the ISS isn't just at risk of UV, it's also at risk of cosmic rays and lots of other sources of radiation. This is a big concern for long-distance/long-term space travel (especially leaving Earth's magnetic field) so a Mars mission would need heavy shielding.   The windows in the ISS, as well as being incredibly strong (they've got to keep in a pressurised atmosphere and survive micrometeorite strikes), will filter out UV radiation from the sun.
The Mariana trench is about 11,000 meters below sea level. If you built a cofferdam down to that depth, as u/SirHerald suggests, the pressure would be about 3.2 atm. Divers experience a similar pressure at a depth of around 22 meters, so humans can survive these pressures in the short term. In the long term, I found [this chart](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/conghand/fig15d3.gif) from NASA suggesting you would have to worry about mild [nitrogen narcosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis), making you feel slightly drunk, and mild [oxygen toxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity). So you probably wouldn't want to live at that pressure, but a short trip down wouldn't be any worse than diving.  But, your question was about draining the oceans. The oceans cover 72% of the surface of the earth, and the average depth of the ocean is about 3700 meters. That means a large portion of the atmosphere will sink into the ocean, resetting 1 atm of pressure to a depth of something like 2600 meters below sea level. So that would make the Mariana trench a bit more tolerable at around 2.5 atm, but it would also mean some high altitude cities would become nearly uninhabitable.   **edit** Fixed the bracket on the link. Wish I had caught it before I left this morning - wasn't expecting this to blow up so much.
Instead of draining the ocean, what about a cofferdam down to the ocean floor? Something like a giant tube all the way down so that you were at the elevation of the bottom of the ocean.  Are you interested in whether we could breath there or if the pressure would be too high?
How in the world did you calculate the effect drained oceans would have on changing overall atmospheric pressure?
Would heavier gasses such as radon naturally collect at the deeper parts? I could see that becoming a problem.
I guess that's the better question.  Besides the obvious fact that we'd all obviously die.  It's a question in environment.   Assuming pressures remain same at current sea levels, what would pressures and temperatures and oxygen be like at say Challenger Deep?  Also, going step further...what would happen with current levels and Temps at say sea level if ocean magically drained?
You can see the relevant numbers in his post. Average depth and coverage area. One thing not covered is how the weight of the water effects the topography. Without it things would level out a bit.
in theory, they already collect at sea level currently.  could become more dense if the lowest altitudes became more concentrated.  There would be influence on weather patterns beyond comprehension (depending on the parameters of the theoretical situation) which would be relevent I expect.
I assume that would be a very messy and unpleasant process? 
You're goddamn right there would be influence. Especially if you consider the ginormous amount of water that's gone and the potential evaporation that goes with it.
There would be a lot of earthquakes if all of the Earth's oceans suddenly disappeared
There is so much stuff to think about in this thread.  How much does the ocean weigh?
"[Volume of all water in Oceans, Seas, & Bays = 1,338,000,000 km^3](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/SyedQadri.shtml)  Mass of water per litre - 1 kg  1000 litres per cubic metre, 1x10^9 m^3 per km^3  therefore 1000 kg/m^3 * 1x10^9 m^3 / km^3 * 1.338x10^9 km^3 = 1.338 x 10^21 kg of water, or 1.338 Yg (Yotta = 10^24 ) of water (**not** Zg (zetta grams) as I'd previously noted).   Someone should double check my math...  EDIT - Forgot to take into account salt content and compression of water. Time for an engineer to step in I think, I'm out of my ""*depth*""..."
Should be a little higher, right? Despite being assumed so in many disciplines, liquid water isn't *actually* incompressible. Not sure if the difference would show up in four significant figures or not.
Someone's already calculated it and you're pretty bang on http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/AvijeetDut.shtml  Although it doesn't look like any of you have accounted for the slightly higher density of saltwater... though there's probably more error in the measurement of the volume of water.
How do you measure compressibility? Do most materials change density predictably/uniformly as the pressure changes (assuming temperature is held constant)? Or do they behave differently over different ranges of pressures?
This ends up being a pretty defining characteristic of different materials.
Optometrist here. It should cause no permanent damage to vision in an adult. Many elderly people have dense cataracts (which, if left long enough, would act pretty much the same as covering the eye). When these cataracts are removed, vision goes back to normal, assuming that no other diseases are present. 
I‚Äôm on mobile, not sure how to cite but Hubel and Wiesel actually won a Nobel Prize for answering that question in cats. No permanent effects would be apparent in adults, they would just have a hard time adjusting to light at first. However, if a newborn child (in this case kitten) were to have its eyes sewn shut for a year, the visual system would not develop correctly and they would basically be blind  http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_rouge05.html
"TL;DR: No unless the brain is still developing.  I just got my degree in Psychology and can answer this in terms of brain development. Permanent loss of vision has not been observed in adults, as u/Moorgan17 stated earlier. Permanent loss of vision has been seen however in young animals. A study was conducted years ago where one of a kitten's eyes was stitched up pretty much right from birth. I believe the eye was kept closed for about a year (at least a couple of months, but I'll double check that). When the eye was opened back up again, the kitten was permanently blind in that eye. I'll try find then start and link it. I'm on mobile right now.  This has to do with the Occam's razor effect that developing brains have. This behaviour transcends species and basically means ""If you're not using it, get rid of it"". It's a way of the brain not putting effort into something that doesn't work anymore. It's even been shown that the part of the brain associated with the loss of sight ends up working on some other part of the body (kind of like how blind people have slightly heightened other senses). This is known as brain plasticity.  Side note: brain plasticity also works in the opposite way. A young girl had half of her brain removed in an attempt to relieve her of her constant seizures. This left the young girl paralyzed on one half of her body and with several cognitive difficulties too. Over time, however, the half of the brain that was left began to compensate for the lack of brain mass and she began to regain movement in the side of her body affected by the surgery, her language and other cognitive skills.   Basically brains are cool.   Edit: a video on Jody, the girl with half a brain https://youtu.be/VaDlLD97CLM  Edit 2: for those interested in the kitten study, see Hubel, D. H. & Wiesel, T. N. (1964). Effects of Monocular Deprivation in Kittens  As it turns out, the kittens' eyes were sutured for only a few weeks, not even months."
If the eye is covered does it still focus?  If it doesn't could the muscles that control focus atrophy and cause issues?
I'm genuinely curious, How is sewing a kittens eye lids shut ethical?
The muscles that control focus are ring-shaped autonomic sphincters and those rarely wear out or you'd leak.  Plus they have no effect after 50 or 55.. they continue to work but the lens doesn't deform in response so the eyes don't focus up close and reading glasses must be used to add the missing focusing power.  The H&W experiments and many others show that the absence of light OR focusable forms will severely restrict vision development, but once the neurology develops say by age 8-10, occlusion does no harm.  
"Basically the crystalline lens (behind the cornea) is made of cells that continually grow from birth. Those cells can't go anywhere and ultimately stack on top of each other and eventually ""cloud up"" after years and years.   From u/nxplkbl ""The crystalline lens is behind the cornea and flexes and allows you to focus from distance to up close. It becomes cloudy after years of sun exposure, sorta like clear plastic left in the sun over time becomes brown.   Cataract surgery is when an ophthalmologist removes and replaces the crystalline lens. ""   Trauma can also cause cataracts and some people get them early. They can cause blurry vision, haziness, night glare issues, and if left untreated blindness. Most people start getting them in their 50s, and some people's take years to fully develop.   Source: am optician  Edit for information correction"
There are special regulations, but things like this get approved for research all the time. It‚Äôs technically ethical because they are not in pain 
Oh man, I thought it was because the muscles got weaker with age. You're saying the lens loses elasticity? Somehow I find that worse.
By that logic, it would be ethical if I anesthetized someone, castrated them while they're anesthetized, and then keep them sedated until its healed. 
Realisticly it's probably better, medical advances could see artificial lenses produced and (I'm assuming) replaced, where a muscle (I imagine) would be harder to fix
Yes, pets are spayed/neutered all the time, pretty much as you described. Nobody has an issue with that.
>someone  Well obviously humans fall into completely different regulations and oversight committee and require consent. Institutional Review Boards came about after Tuskegee to scrutinize research involving people  If it were an animal and you had a legitimate research reason to do it, then yeah you probably would be allowed to.
Lens replacement [does already exist](http://www.allaboutvision.com/visionsurgery/refractive-lens-exchange.htm). It's not FDA-approved, but there are plenty of doctors that will do it. I think it's one of the most promising vision correction options I've heard of- I read an article years back about someone who was trying to develop an artificial lens that could give greater than 20/20 vision, and the procedure basically just involves sucking out your old lens, and rolling up the new artificial one into a small syringe and injecting it into the eye.
Different sphincter 
How do you think the procedure and drugs to do the procedure was created? Research...
It‚Äôs not that we forget our earliest years, it‚Äôs that we don‚Äôt form memories in the first place. The term for this is infantile ‚Äúamnesia‚Äù, but this is not actually a form of amnesia ‚Äî that would require forgetting. As infants grow into toddlers, their brains grow fantastically quickly. So much so, that any pathways that are deemed unimportant/weak are ‚Äúpruned‚Äù. Pruning is the technical term actually. By age three, pruning calms down to the point where toddlers can start forming the memories they‚Äôll remember for possibly the rest of their lives. However, usually the very earliest memories are traumatic or notable in some way. Pruning continues for some time into childhood. Maybe age 4.   Edit: this has gotten more traction than I anticipated, and I have to clarify: when I say ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt form memories in the first place‚Äù what I‚Äôm saying is that we form memories that we will NOT be able to RECALL after our brains grow and pruning occurs. Toddlers can remember things, but, as we‚Äôve all experienced, they forget an exceptional amount of their day-to-day experiences. As another user pointed out, toddlers actually are learning a metric ton of stuff (motor, language, etc.).   Edit 2: another user pointed out that it is the delayed development of the hippocampus (learning/memory/encoding center) that contributes to infantile amnesia. 
"What you are taking about is autobiographical memory.  Infants easily form other types of memories, including procedural memory (eg learning to walk), and semantic memory (learning what things are).  Infantile amnesia is limited to autobiographical memories.  There are lots of ideas as to why this is.  One is a lack of self awareness - the child hasn't yet learned that they are an individual and that there are other individuals.  The second is language development.  Autobiographical memory is often descriptive, eg. ""I went to the store "".  Encoding this memory may rely on language skills that have not yet developed.  These are all related to the underlying neurophysiological development."
"Check out this article, it's essentially saying that the brain isn't really concerned about memories at that age, it just needs to get a grip on how reality works.  https://www.livescience.com/32963-why-dont-we-remember-being-babies.html  This article covers a much wider range of subjects including the gap in memory varies by up to 2 years depending on where you're born, the article says one theory on that is some cultures don't value early childhood memories and that may affect how hard we try to hold onto them. The article has no definitive answer but covers what appear to be reasonable theories such as the brain isn't ""recording"" episodic memories or *can't* record them yet due to a still-growing hippocampus. http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160726-the-mystery-of-why-you-cant-remember-being-a-baby  This article is more focused on the explanation being proposed that the brain is still developing neurons in the region where memories are formed.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-can-t-you-remember-being-a-baby/  I am absolutely not an expert in this field but I've read enough to know that memories are the connections between neurons in specific parts of the brain. There is also an element of flexibility, called [plasticity](https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticityhttps://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticity), in the brain that defines how easily connections are made or broken.   When we are very young the brain is very flexible, we have a lot to learn. Connections are made and broken quickly.   It would seem plausible that driving force for not being able to recall specific memories while the brain is still adding neurons to the memory-related parts of the brain(the bbc article mentions this) and while the brain is still extraordinarily flexible, those connections that make memories may not last very long. New neurons would disrupt those networks of connections and new memories could be making use of connections involved in other memories until there isn't enough left of a given episode's network to recall the memory.   I wouldn't be surprised if culture played into that as well, if you try to hold onto a memory your attempt to access it can strengthen the connections to the episode over time and make it harder to forget(no idea if that affects accuracy of the memory). If no one in your culture gives a shit about a specific type of memory why bother trying to recall it?   I know just enough about this stuff to get myself into trouble so check the sources and don't quote me on jack shit."
One of my degrees is child development, and this is a great answer. Simple so anyone can understand and still spot on. 
Well put my friend. Do you work in Psychology? 
I research how scientists communicate with the public and you would be surprised how many scientists use field-specific words, which often excludes the public. Research suggests that scientists who can communicate their field of study in simple terms are perceived as more knowledgeable by their audiences versus scientists who use too many fancy words so people can't understand.
As someone who has an interest in child development (I am at the early stages of a psychology degree) what reading do you recommend?
No, but I had a really good teacher named Dr. Gabriel Radvansky. He has a textbook called Human Memory that is really well written. I highly recommend it. 
I can't think of any readings in particular right now, but I would recommend using your university's peer-reviewed article access and just look up child development, and let the research pull you through articles that you find interesting. Also make sure you try to look at it from different perspectives- scientific, psychological, counseling, school, etc.  My undergrad was in psych with a counseling minor, and I was intending on adolescent counseling before switching career paths so it's a topic I love too. I'll try to remember to come back with some readings for you.
I‚Äôm a Neuropsychologist my self. I became fascinated with memory when I learned about Clive Wearing. It blew my mind. I would highly suggest learning about him if you are fascinated by memory. There are wonderful free documentaries on YouTube about him and his wife also wrote a book about him. Def check it out! 
"Dogs are relatively intelligent, with complex personalities, so the answer isn't completely ""yes"" or ""no.  The simple answer is no, in the general case dogs can recognize other dogs, but don't show preference for certain breeds.  This has been tested with simple visual identification:  Dogs recognize the dog species among several other species on a computer screen  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130214103703.htm  The complicated answer is closer to ""yes"", because the size and behavior of the other dogs will be relevant to their social dynamic.  Also, dogs may respond to certain smells or visual cues that correspond to various breeds depending on that dog's personal experience; Paedomorphosis affects agonistic visual signals of domestic dogs.  (In fact there is a study called ""Paedomorphosis affects agonistic visual signals of domestic dogs.   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000334729690370X)   In addition to that, the instinctive methods of communication may be slightly different between breeds   So while dogs don't necessarily prefer one breed over others, the morphology and psychology inherent to different breeds will affect how they treat different dogs.  In addition, they can make positive or negative associations that correlate to those breeds."
Is there any information on *how* dogs seem to recognize all breeds, despite the large differences? What 'tells' a tiny corgi that a great Dane in the distance is, in fact, a dog and vice versa? 
Fantastic answer!  Fascinating and educational.  Thank you for that insight!!!
">The complicated answer is closer to ""yes"", because the size and behavior of the other dogs will be relevant to their social dynamic.    Followup question on the above - if size and behaviour is relevant to their social dynamic, what happens if two dogs of vastly different sizes grow up together? I'm guessing behavior would form based on their interactions, but if you have a tiny dog and a massive dog, will the tiny dog tend to view other massive dogs as ""friends"" and vice versa? And would the tiny dog be more likely to view other tiny dogs as not part of their social circle due to common interactions with massive dogs, and vice versa? "
You could ask the same question about how humans recognize various dog breeds despite them looking so different. I don't remember ever seeing an unfamiliar dog breed and not knowing it was a dog.
Your brain will compensate away the green tint, similar to automatic color balance in a camera, and the gray will then look red in comparison. Knowing anything about strawberries is not necessary.  The brain guesses that the background is meant to be white, which helps this compensation happen.
"Even though the ""red"" in the altered image is literally just gray, it is still *more* red than green is on the hue scale. If we break the colors into the RGB components, the green will be something like R:0 G:200 B:50, and the grey will be R:100 G:100 G:100, that is, much more red component and much less green component.  The eye/brain's color processing is super complex, but the most simple version is that we take a lot of cues from the *differences* between shades, and not their absolute values."
I actually messed around with that picture today. Here's an imgur link to my experiments: http://imgur.com/a/y9TGC  I made it an indexed image with 3 colors: black, white, and blue.  Zoomed out, the berries look red (so it wasn't the varied shades of gray causing it).  The more you zoom in, the effect goes away.  I was staring at it up close, then would zoom out slowly and there was like a magic % zoom where the colors would just kind of pop in - really weird.   I have a cousin-in-law that has a degree in art/painting/color theory and said it had to do with the color white, since it's made of all colors.  I tried replacing the white with a ton of different colors, and the illusion immediately goes away.  I then did some color corrections (curves) and re-indexed it with 5 colors: red, green, blue, black, white - and was able to recreate what the original image probably was.  
Yes. A person who has never seen a strawberry before, will still see them red.  You can crop a small part of the image (where you see red) with 'paint' for example, and look at it alone, so that it is no longer obvious that you are looking at a strawberry, and you still see that small area red.  However, if you copy that reddish color (use the color picker tool) and paint some lines in other place, over white background, you won't see it red any longer. Now it will be clearly grey. It becomes reddish when you use that color next to the other greenish color.  [example](http://i.imgur.com/matFq6b.png)
This has always been my favorite illusion like this.  The center cross pieces of each X are the exact same color!  [Image](http://www.illusionspoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Color-Adapting-optical-illusion-4.jpg)  If you cover up everything but the center pieces, you can see that they're identical.
See if this helps clear things up: http://imgur.com/a/asxki  TIDL (Too impatient, didn't look): It has nothing to do with the strawberries, it only has to do with the two colors being next to each other.  Your brain perceives color as what is there modified by what is nearby.  Local changes in color affect your brain's perception.
This is the answer. It's called [color constancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy). You could replace the strawberries in the picture with plastic balls and they would still look red because we are adjusting for the lighting, not (only) using knowledge or strawberries.
This is the same reason why there was a blue/black vs. white/gold debate about that famous dress that went viral a few years back.  The dress was blue and black, but the (yellow?) lighting in the picture turned the pixels white and gold. The picture was taken in such a way as to put it right on the cusp, so some peoples' brains were filtering out the lighting and seeing it as blue and black. Whereas others were seeing just the pixels and their brain didn't do the math for them, so they saw white/gold.
This was my first thought as well but can anybody confirm?
http://imgur.com/a/DtqDs here is the same image with everything but the center piece painted white. They are in fact the same color.
Thank you for that link. But sheesh, the cylinder and checker board picture will never *not* mess with me.
Additionally the room was lit in such a way and combined with the flash it could be viewed two ways. The most common adjustment we're used to is seeing a light object under a shadow, and that is white/gold lookers perceived the dress. It looked like it was being shadowed in a brightly lit room. The blue/black lookers interpreted the camera flash as to having flushed out all the color and applying a yellow filter to everything. By changing perspective between the literal pixels and an adjusted perception of the flash, one could see it both ways.
Yes, I saw this on a photographer's twitter and in the discussion someone posted the RGB histogram showing that the photo actually has red pixels in it, and quite a few. That's due to the way our current display technology displays colors/grays
Look at the pixels on the left side, they don't look slightly pink to you? 
Congratulations you're normal. One of the most interesting things about the illusion is that we can't help it even when we know what's going on!
This is the one that still blows my mind every time I see it. Even in thumbnail size it looks like two COMPLETELY different colors. [I had to analyze the picture in software to be convinced it was really the same](http://www.relativelyinteresting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/color+trick+green+blue+illusion.jpg)
I don't know what's going on with your brain but to me that circle could not be more grey.
Yep. Even [this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Grey_square_optical_illusion_proof2.svg/512px-Grey_square_optical_illusion_proof2.svg.png), which makes it plain as day, doesn't stop my eyes from trying to see a gradient.  Edit: Image link wasn't showing what I expected.
"The stripes aren't exactly the same color unless you only take the color from the center of the line. The orange and purple ""bleed"" into the green stripes, which makes the orange-tainted stripes look more green and the purple-tainted stripes more blue.   I'm not saying this illusion doesn't work, it just isn't an illusion if the average color of the stripes is different.  Edit: see OP's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5x3wr2/comment/defhkxt?st=IZSWGOIK&sh=af96723e) for versions with less compression artifacts"
This actually destroyed the illusion entirely for me.  So did blocking out the other squares nearby with my thumbs.  That's neat.
It's really fun to bring it into paint, use the eyedropper tool to select the color, and draw around on the squares. Looks like you have a magic gradient tool: http://i.imgur.com/8orHDcb.png
For me it sort of phases in and out of looking like a gradient and looking like a solid chunk of grey. Neat.
The solid block didn't look like a gradient to me but the thin scribble definitely does! Neat.
But the shadow makes it the exact same color as A. Your brain knows it's a shadow though and tells you it's lighter
Radioactivity, by itself, is not that useful for generating power. What is useful for generating power is the induced splitting of _lots_ of atoms at the same time, not the slow trickle of energy release you get from radioactive decay alone. To put it another way: nuclear reactors don't work because their fuel is radioactive, they work because their fuel is splittable by neutrons. Those are not the same thing (all fuel splittable by neutrons is radioactive, but not all radioactive atoms are splittable by neutrons). 
Strictly speaking, we CAN use most nuclear waste. Breeder reactors can be used to consume pretty much all usable fissle materials and produce a much lower volume of equivalent waste with different properties.  Breeder reactors can be used to manufacture weapons grade fissile material though, so there's political aspects, as well as economic ones-- uranium is fairly abundant.  Edit: spelling errors.
It is very usable, just not in our current nuclear reactors. Uranium fuel rods are pellets of uranium held together by a metal casing. Being inside a reactor causes the metal to become brittle, and the life of the fuel rod is determined by the life of that casing.   In other reactor designs, like molten salt reactors, this casing is not used. The fuel stays in the reactor for much longer and much more of the potential energy is extracted. This results in lower volumes of waste that is much less radioactive for much less time than that coming from traditional reactors.   Learn more about molten salt reactors [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor). They‚Äôre pretty awesome!
American scientists developed a nuclear reprocessing system called PUREX (Plutonium-Uranium Extraction) to resume spent nuclear fuel rods. But Ford suspended it and Carter ended it permanently because of the plutonium by-product and the Non-Proliferation Agreements. Now France reprocesses many nation's fuel for reuse using this 50 year old technology.
To add to this, radioactive decay CAN be used as energy source in radioisotope thermal generators, where the heat from decaying atoms is used to generate electricity. Satellites use these for low power generation.
> Breeder reactors can be used to manufacture weapons grade fissile material though, so there's political aspects, as well as economic ones-- uranium is fairly abundant.  Where does the perception come from then that i've heard in debates in college that there is only 50 years of uranium supply left in the world from current mines ?  One source says 200 years but 30k with breeder reactors-  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/
Do they use recycled nuclear waste or does it require more potent material?
From current mines, that's the key point. As with any non-renewable, as long as there is demand, we will keep looking for new sources even if they are more expensive. Extraction from seawater could provide hundreds of years of fuel, but it's no where as cheap as digging up rocks.
You are confusing molten sodium metal and molten salt.   Molten salts are extremely stable.  This is because the constituent atoms are very electronegative (fluorine) and electropositive (lithium,beryllium). It takes a lot of energy to break their bonds and once you do they can simply recombine.  This is why they are so useful in reactors.  The neutron damage that occurs in other materials doesn't happen in molten salts.  This is why the fuel can be left in the reactor until it is largely consumed.  Comparatively, the fuel rods in a light water reactor must be removed after only a few percent of the fuel is consumed.
If I remember correctly many satellites use plutonium, a by-product from making uranium for nuclear bombs. 
Thousands actually if memory is correct. If i remember correctly, there's enough fuel in the ocean (uranium flouride aka UF6 ) to power modern reactors for 15000 years. Also we will find more ways to be efficient 
Not necessarily a by-product. Rather, non-fissile Uranium-238 is 'enriched' in a reactor so it turns into plutonium via beta decay. It's usually the intended product, not leftovers. Small amounts can be produced in normal reactors, with the small amounts of 238 left after purifying the raw uranium. But it is probably easier to take it from a nuclear arsenal than slowly gathering it from the nuclear waste with chemistry. I may be wrong though, corrections are welcome. 
There's a paper out there that argues that by combining seawater extraction with breeder reactors, we could supply several times our current energy consumption until the Sun swallows the Earth.
So, why not use this capability to desalinate water, while harvesting sweet sweet radioactive material?
Exactly, Pu238 is used, which is primarily an alpha emitter. Alphas have very short range in matter because they are massive and highly charged, so they primarily heat the plutonium itself. The decay heat is harvested and used to make electricity.  238 is present in spent nuclear fuel but is difficult to produce in a normal reactor. It's normally made by neutron activation of Np237 or less commonly of Americium. Most of it was produced as part of nuclear weapons prduction at Savannah River, but they stopped and there was fear of a shortage for space applications. NASA currently has a joint project with the Department of Energy to develop ways to produce more.  Edit: thanks for gold! To add, DoE/NASA is interested in ways to produce 238 that are both economical and proliferation resistant. It doesn't make sense to produce it like they used to because it's too expensive and only made sense as a byproduct of weapons production. The original process is also a proliferation concern, because the other product is Pu239 in a form that is the kind you need to make weapons.
It can also be recovered by the nuclear fission of Thorium-232. This is most easily done in a liquid-fluoride thorium reactor, a type of molten salt reactor.
I mean... M.A.D. has resulted in the most peaceful period of time in all of human history. It's sad that we were only able to create this peace by making war so world-endingly horrifying that no one wants to attempt it anymore, but I'll take the win all the same. 
This is just not true.  It sounds good, fits a narrative and people repeat it, but the facts don‚Äôt bear it out.  1) you can‚Äôt have a thorium cycle without obtaining enriched uranium or plutonium first.  Thorium isn‚Äôt fissile, it needs to be bred by neutron capture into u-233.  Assuming you have a driver fuel to start the reaction off (u-233, u-235 or pu-239) then you can breed more u-233, but only slowly - Eg if you get 2.3-ish neutrons per fission, 1 is needed to induce another fission to continue the reaction, 1 is needed to breed th-232 to u-233 to maintain the original quantity of fuel, then you have 0.3 to cover losses and breeding new fuel.  Most goes to losses (it‚Äôs actually very hard to get into breed most rather than a net burn) so you end up growing your original fuel only very slowly if at all.  Best way to create the original supply of driver fuel is then to dig up and enrich the only naturally occurring fissile isotope u-235.  For practical purposes you have to start with uranium first.  This can be either by enrichment t get it to a good enough quality to drive a thorium reactor or by using it in a uranium cycle and obtaining plutonium as a by product which can then be used as your driver fuel.  Either way you inevitably end up with the uranium enrichment or plutonium breeding technology to produce bombs.  There literally isn‚Äôt a way of getting to a thorium cycle up and running without creating technology that could be used to create bomb grass material.  2) there have been many attempts at thorium research reactors and it turns out its hard.  It‚Äôs not like the technology has just been idly ignored.  Billions have been thrown at the problem from a variety of nations.  The most promising tech is usually considered liquid thorium salt (unfortunately highly corrosive), as it would allow a continual process of feeding in to a reactor fresh thorium and extracting the fission products (which poisons the reaction by absorbing neutrons - bad for breeding).  But even today the materials tech that can cope with a thorium liquid salt at commercial scale isn‚Äôt there (ie providing commercial scale outputs for decades).  Comparatively uranium fuel cycles are readily achievable even with 1950‚Äôs tech.  There are lots of research programmes but again demonstrably with 60 years of scientific and engineering advancements, not a single country has managed a viable thorium commercial reactor.
If I understand the political angle correctly, there are several issues, there is a great deal of cost in getting the eventual ok to build a new nuclear reactor.  While I would say a good deal of any energy sector regulation is there because of safety, there is little political will with how nuclear is seen (in the US and maybe Japan) to streamline the permit process to build new reactors.  Because it is prohibitively expensive to get through the permit process, that is if they make it through, most interested in making money off energy can go other safer routes (safer as in sure ROI).  And because so few get approved and built (make it more expensive) the pay back time on a nuclear reactor is pretty long.  Add to the fact the there is a shortage of nuclear workers (Navy has a hard time keeping theirs) that probably adds to it as well.  There are also subsidies for other forms of energy and I am not sure if nuclear has the same.  In the end it comes down to economics, public perception/willpower, and politics.  Personally I would like the talk of the infrastructure plan to include many nuclear power plants as the ones in the US we have are old and continually upgraded, but new ones would probably be better.
Oddly enough, I understood most of that.  Not because I am a nuclear engineer, but because I played entirely too much modded Minecraft with packs that included [IndustricalCraft](https://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php/Tutorial:Nuclear_Power) and [GregTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvypcjW_Vmc).
So, immunotherapy has long been seen as a holy grail for cancer treatment. The immune system is naturally programmed to attack cells that have gone a bit weird (to use the scientific term). The problem tends to be that the cancer cells can also alter themselves so that they are disguised from the immune system, or in fact inhibit any immune cells that come into contact with them. This stops the immune system from seeing them as dangerous, allowing the cancer to grow. So the balance of the immune response is in favour of leaving the cancer alone.  What this treatment does is inject the tumour with molecules that tell the immune cells in the vicinity of the tumour to wake up and start doing their job, overcoming the inhibition that the cancer cells have put in place. This means that the balance of the immune response is now to attack the tumour, which seems to work very well.  The really cool thing is that now that the immune system is trained to see the tumour as bad, and will attack similar cells in different sites. This is why it behaves in some fashion like a vaccine.  It's perfectly viable, and very exciting. As always, there is always the question of how well it translates into human biology but it is still very promising. I think one problem is going to be how specific the immune response is. In the paper, they see the immune cells are trained to attack cells with protein markers unique to the tumour cells, which is a good sign. One concern might be that if you accidentally trigger the immune response to normal cell markers, it could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells which would obviously be a very bad consequence. Another would be how readily a tumour can evolve to overcome the immune system attack. If the immune system only ends up going for certain markers, it could miss tumour cells that don't have the same ones. These could then continue to grow and cause the cancer to return.  ETA: thank you kind, golden stranger!  ...strangers!
I work in this field.   This type of cancer vaccine is kinda old news. What's really cutting edge are the personalized cancer vaccines based on mRNA that are in clinical trails in humans **already**. Basically, these vaccines are tailored to an individual's cancer. You see, your cancer and my cancer may have the same name, lymphoma for example, but they may be very different in terms of their susceptibility to drugs and especially to vaccines. Using personal genomics to tailor mRNA to program your own cells to make a vaccine against your very unique form of cancer is the real key to all of this. Adding on top of this is that mRNA is just a superior way to produce vaccines. As it turns out, when your body makes the vaccine inside its own cells, it stimulates your immune system more effectively than a vaccine made in a factory and injected (this has to do with MHC1 and MHC2 activation).   These clinical trials are looking promising. If they work, this can be combined with checkpoint inhibitors and other mRNA therapies (that also boost immune response against cancer) and it's bye-bye cancer.   Let's just say that it's the most promising thing I've seen in cancer therapy ever. 
There is a treatment for stage 4 brain cancer that does this indirectly. Duke has modified the polio virus to attack cancer cells, and they inject it into the center of a brain tumor. While the polio virus is attacking the cells, the immune system starts going in to clean up the mess.  In turn, the immune system learns to recognize the cancer cells.  The whole process seems to last for months after just the one single injection.  You can google PVS-RIPO for further information.  The first few patients were treated in 2012-2013 and some are still alive without any further treatment. Those patients had recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme, which is perhaps the deadliest cancer situation that one can imagine.  While this would technically be considered virotherapy, the immune system plays a huge role in the outcome.  They are now in phase 2 trials, and still only for brain tumors, but I believe the assumption is that it could be widely used among many different solid tumors in the future.
It's actually a really cool concept that frankesteins together mechanisms of action that we already use.  1. Making cancer cells visible to the immune system: PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors  2. Siccing T-cells on cancer: CAR-T cells, Allogenous stem cell transplantation, BiTE immunotherapy  They then do this only locally, circumventing the problems that would arise if we did it systemically, i.e. death from immune system overdrive.  I'm interested in seeing how well it works in humans and reading about it made me slightly nervous about my job to be honest
Paper is available in its entirety here:  [**Eradication of spontaneous malignancy by local immunotherapy**  Idit Sagiv-Barfi, Debra K. Czerwinski, Shoshana Levy, Israt S. Alam, Aaron T. Mayer, Sanjiv S. Gambhir, Ronald Levy - *Science Translational Medicine*](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/426/eaan4488) 
Ah, I see. Thanks for the information.  So, in summary it is very promising, however there are still some concerns that need to be further looked at.
If I am understanding this right... it would mean that this could become an effective treatment for even metastasized cancers, correct - since the immune system, being virtually omnipresent in the body, would be able to perform its seek and destroy mission throughout? 
I just love that someone so smart, also names their account /u/MyPenisIsAWMD  Bravo, sir.
Perhaps you could point out what I am missing because this appears (assuming the results so far continue, i.e. 100% cure rate for all tested cancers) to be The cure for cancer. What need would there be of personalized cancer vaccines if you can simply directly inject the tumor with a non specialized agent and have the immune system generate its own customized response for that exact cancer?
Frankly, in a field where even the possibility of inching forward is worth celebrating, it's very nice to think we may be able to take a full stride.
If it cured 95% of people, but 5% died gruesome autoimmune deaths, would it still be approved, wouldn‚Äôt the treatment still be better than the current chemo and pray treatment methods?
That's what makes this treatment so powerful. It makes the immune system target *all* instances of the cancer throughout the body. 
Its cured artificially induced cancer. Naturally occurring cancer in humans is totally different  as the cancer has had to evade the individuals immune system from scratch in  most cases. The  human trials will be exciting but to assume this is going to translate to the best treatment in humans would be wildly optimistic.
Oh, I agree. It's more likely I will have some form on cancer during my life than not. So, I welcome any inch forward we can take. 
given that you basically just described current chemo for these cancers anyway, the answer is obviously yes
"Other responses have gone into what makes an individual long-lived. This post will address the question as OP phrased it: what determines the lifespan *of a species*? And what's the deal with human longevity?  Many people have a concept of aging that could be described as the ""wear-and-tear"" model. Basically, the notion is that as you go through life, you accumulate nicks and dings from macroscopic scars and stretch marks to accumulating microscopic injury and DNA damage. Eventually it's just too much and you run down. *It turns out this concept is markedly untrue, at least at the species level*.  Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, has been the workhorse of many experiments, including those studying longevity, life-history theory, and evolution. Many years ago, researchers working with flies did an evolution experiment. They selectively bred fruit flies for longevity, and in a remarkably short time they had flies with dramatically longer life-spans than is the norm. These flies weren't evolving novel genes in just a few generations, rather, they had recombined existing alleles in ways that lead to longevity. The important thing to note is what happened when these long-lived flies were re-introduced into a 'normal' population. Did these super-long-lived flies thrive? No, quite the contrary. Within a few short generations, any sign of longevity had disappeared. In competition with their 'normal' counterparts, they were immediately outcompeted. (I tried finding the original papers, here's a [modern replication](http://www.pnas.org/content/97/7/3309.full) of these sorts of studies, with more precision.)  What these researchers discovered was that while longevity is perfectly possible, and within the realm of already-existing genes in most populations, this potential isn't realized *because of trade-offs*. Increased longevity is exchanged for decreased fitness in other areas. Perhaps these long-lived flies in nature would be less likely to evade predators, have more difficulty finding food, or are less likely to find a mate. Everything has a cost. Note that this is different than the 'programmed' idea of death, that your genes have predetermined a time of death for you. In the life-history model of aging, it's not that DNA 'wants' an organism to die, far from it - it's just that other traits (that hurt longevity) are more directly advantageous to the propagation of genes, and so combinations of genes with these traits out-survive and out-reproduce the combinations that lead to longevity.  The immune system gets interesting. Unless something else kills it first, it's all but inevitable that an animal will die of cancer. The ticking clock of mutations accumulate, eventually leading cells to proliferate out of control, breaking internal apoptosis mechanisms, evading the immune system, and eventually killing the host organism by hogging the lion's share of nutrients and energy.  What exactly is a 'cancer resistance gene' or a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? Why would anything evolve a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? That doesn't make sense, and they don't. Rather, it's a gene that is perilously close to breaking something important, if it mutates. *Redundancy* is an important concept. If you have 3 copies of something important, you're more or less ok if 2 of them break. If you only have 1 copy, you will be in trouble quickly. Animals that tend to be long-lived, such as elephants and whales, tend to have many, multiply redundant copies of genes involved in important functions like apoptosis and immune regulation - the sorts of genes that when they break ~~tend to cause~~ are no longer able to stop cancer.  Humans don't seem to have nearly enough multiply-redundant copies of these sorts of genes to explain all of our longevity, while it might contribute somewhat. We don't look like elephants or whales in this respect. This sort of evolution towards longevity would reasonably be expected to take a relatively long time to evolve, as many duplication events would have to happen, and then spread through the population.   It seems humans are probably like the flies that were selectively bred specifically for longevity. In humans, the [grandmother hypothesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/428128a)  conceives of human longevity as something that is directly advantageous to gene propagation ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis) introduces the concept well). It's a sort of grandiose kin selection, where elderly humans in prehistoric times were still able to contribute to the survival and reproductive fitness of their children, grandchildren, and extended relatives. Unlike other species that experience a rapid deterioration after their own ability to reproduce goes into decline (such as salmon after spawning), humans *could* contribute into their later years, and so longevity was selected for. Maybe we're not so unlike our experimental flies after all."
Evolutionary biologist here, a lot of the posts here are accurately describing the mechanisms by which we are better protected from aging, but behind each of those is a genetic prerogative for longer life.  The first principle is that the fitness of an organism is defined as its ability to produce offspring which in turn survive to reproduce.  If humans live longer that a comparable species, it must be because of an increase in fitness. Some of the leading theories are longer term parental care or multi generational families.  Think about it this way: why should women ever go through menopause?  It's because having non reproductive women in the social group increases the fitness of her offspring. 
There's no hard-and-fast rule that I'm aware of, but several things factor into it (in no particular order).  1. Metabolism. As a general rule, the slower the organism's metabolism, the longer it will usually live.  2. Growth rate. The slower the growth, the longer the lifespan.  3. Age at maturity. Animals that reach maturity at a later age tend to have a longer lifespan.
From an evolutionary perspective, if an animal is likely to be eaten early on in its life, it doesn't make sense for that species to invest energy on lengthening its life. More likely, it would invest its energy in producing as many offspring as quickly as possible.  An animal that is not easily predated is more likely to invest energy in processes that lengthen lifespan, and focus on raising just a few offspring (quality vs. quantity).
Cool! This explained things very well for me. Thank you!
The fruit fly study is really interesting, though now I would be curious to know what are the down sides of long life? Surely longer life in flies would just lead to more offspring. In what way are they being disadvantaged? Are they slower? Less fertile? Something else?
So then why do tortoises live so long?
Exactly.  Humans have more learned behaviors than most other species.  Having a longer youth and longer parental lifespans allows this to be better passed on to the next generation.  So there is an evolutionary advantage to living longer for us.
The cancer resistance gene is question is TP53, which has a suppressive effect on tumors. Unfortunately it seems to cause premature aging as a side-effect on mice trials.  We can only hope that multiple genes for cancer, aging, metabolism and many many others can be identified and engineered soon.
What about parrots? It seems like they contradict all of those
There is a general negative correlation between longevity and fecundity - i.e. how rapidly a group reproduces. There have been experiments in which animals were put into an environment with none of their natural predators, and as their average lifespan extended they found the individuals were reproducing later and later. Not really an answer to your question but just an illustration how the two things could be linked in principle. 
More to the point, why are certain lobsters and jellyfish immortal as far as we can tell? 
I am certain humanity will achieve immunity from ageing and illness. The day after I die. 
Can those genes be retroactively implemented? to cure me when I get cancer? or only for my future kids?
I recall having seen a study that showed a pretty strong correlation between the age of puberty/sexual maturity and longevity, even among indivuduals of the same species. E.g. late sexual maturity means a longer potential life span.  On a very shallow level I can definitely see how achieving reproductive capabilities later than other individuals might be a disadvantage as you may die of external causes before you can reproduce. Longer generations would make a species adapt slower to environmental changes, which may also be a weakness.
Jellyfish is an easy one: lack of a ~~neural~~ central nervous system means a lack of most problems that cause us death. Human death is mainly due to a lack of oxygen flow to the brain. No brain solves that pretty quickly.  EDIT for correct wording.
Trees live a pretty long time as well. We always forget plants in these sorts of discussions, but they are our cousins.
One of the reasons you get cancer is because genes such as Tp53 are mutated and non-functional. We battle cancer by targeting the downstream effects of these mutations!
">Longer generations would make a species adapt slower to environmental changes, which may also be a weakness.  This can be seen easily when comparing humans and bacteria. The ability reproduce quickly is the reason bacteria become resistant to so many things so quickly.   It's also the reason we don't rapidly adapt to bacteria.  It's partially because we already did. The development of the immune system was the adaption to bacteria.   It becomes interesting when you look at how fast bacteria reproduce in proportion to humans.   E.Coli for example reproduce every ~20 minutes or so. If we give ""modern humans"" 100k years of existence then it only takes E.Coli a short time to go through the same amount of ""evolution"" to an environment as humans did in 100k years.   Even if the numbers are off by quite a bit, a sludge puddle of E.Coli will ""evolve"" as much as humans have in 100,000 years in a few months. 1 HOUR for E.Coli is roughly 60 human years of ""evolution"" (assuming 20 year generations in humans). So by the time this post is a day old the E.Coli on your food will have had 1440 human equivalent years.   It gives an interesting perspective on the microbiological world that inhabits and surrounds us.   "
Had no clue they are brainless. How do they function at all without one?
The thing is, while jellyfish don't have a brain or central nervous system, they do have a very basic set of nerves at the base of their tentacles. These nerves detect touch, temperature, salinity etc. and the jellyfish reflexively respond to these stimuli. A brain is simply a cluster of nerves, this concept of nerve clusters is very very basic in jellyfish
"Many animals are ""brainless"" at least if you define ""brained"" as having a fully realized and complex neural center similar to the human brain.  A lot of smaller or simpler creatures are much like simple machines: they operate under simple parameters and react to stimuli in simple ways. A jellyfish doesn't need to do terribly much; they simply float from place to place, feeding on microscopic organisms that drift by. Thus, they don't have a whole lot of need for a complex brain.  Worms are another good example--they don't have a centralized and complex brain, but they do have a nervous system that allows them to do simple things. A worm really only needs to do a few things consciously to survive: Burrow, avoid heat, and wiggle around if something tries to grab it. All tasks that can be completed without a brain.  In fact, even in the human body, a lot gets done without having to get the ""main"" part of the brain involved. A lot of automatic actions in our body are handled by our brain stem (heartbeat, unconscious breathing, contractions in your digestive tract), and even some dramatic body movements (like when you automatically pull your arm away from a hot stove) don't even need to involve the brain--just your spinal cord and brain stem.  Humans and many complex creatures get a lot of benefit out of having complex brains--we use them for memories, processing of sights, sounds, complex thoughts, emotions, and more. But when you're a jellyfish whose lifestyle centers around floating from place to place, and you don't have eyes, ears, a nose, or any need for memories or complex emotions, it's fairly easy to get away without having a brain."
So, a jellyfish can be described, at its most basic, as a floating brain? 
A floating bundle of buttons that, when pressed, cause specific actions. It's a reflex, just your leg kicking out when you hit that spot under the kneecap. 
"[Lake Baikal](http://www.irkutsk.org/baikal/animals.htm) (deepest freshwater lake) appears to have complex life forms at it's greatest depths.  ""Baikal is also home to the world's most abyssal freshwater fish. These fish have managed to preserve eyesight even at the greatest depths, although they see only in black and white.""  Also the golomyanka (oil fish) ""can endure most pressure in the depths of the Baikal water. At night it rises to the water surface, and at daytime it swims down to great depths. Limnologists have had a chance to observe the golomynka's behaviour in the water depths. At a depth of 1,000-1,400 metres and more, the golomyanka moves freely both horizontally and vertically, whereas at such a depth even a cannon cannot shoot because of the enormous pressure."""
There are organisms that live at the bottom of the world's deepest lakes such as [amphipods](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1463-6409.2011.00490.x/full), [bacteria](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natalia_Belkova/publication/12725338_Diversity_of_bacteria_at_various_depths_in_the_southern_part_of_lake_Baikal_as_detected_by_16S_rRNA_sequencing/links/00b49528d5fcc08ddc000000.pdf), and fishes like *Trematocara* and Abyssocottids, but not very many for several reasons.  The biggest reason is that the abyssal zone of the ocean is truly enormous and has existed for billions of years. Evolution has been able to have its heyday down there, which has led to a diverse assemblage of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, and other invertebrates.  On top of this, there are only two freshwater lakes on earth that are over 1000 m deep, Baikal and Tanganyika. The latter is about ten million years old, the former perhaps 30 million years old. Compared to the age of the ocean, that is a tiny fraction of time. They have also been isolated from other water bodies due to topography, so there aren't many immigrants that can later evolve into new species.  In addition, Tanganyika has spent a significant proportion of its history as a much shallower lake than this (it was actually multiple lakes, which is [reflected in the diversity of cichlid fish there](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/7087/Mitochondrial_Phylogeography_of_Rock_Dwelling_1996.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)). So the abyssal zone in Tanganyika is relatively young and unstable.  Baikal is older and larger and the abyssal zone was more stable (including never scoured by ice like most similar lakes), but it is still in a cold climate (less biodiversity to begin with) and isolated from other bodies of water. Because of the depth of ice coverage, the entire Baikal ecosystem has occasionally [collapsed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204001099), effectively re-starting the evolutionary race.  So the two lakes on earth that are deep enough to be completely devoid of light just haven't had the evolutionary chances of the ocean.
[Olm!](http://www.radioantena.si/img/Gallery/Photo/cl_3106220b-0171-43e0-8776-66c399783a56.jpg) They're aquatic salamanders endemic to Slovenia, Italy, Croatia and Bosnia. They're basically stuck in their larval cycle and due to living in dark caves they have no eyes. Not 1000 meters deep, but still pretty neat.
Information is minimal but you may find this interesting: https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/08/04/submariners-cast-light-on-bottom-of-lake-superior/d6ca0026-9874-4795-9c87-9de7405b2e03/?utm_term=.fe7a7e14f434  Superior isn't nearly as deep as baikal but still deep enough to be largely lightless.
"Not to be too pedantic, but...  It's not light incoming light just up and dies when it reaches 1000 meters.  As with most substances, the ocean water will have a ""half-distance"" thickness that will block or scatter half the light.  If the half-distance is 100 meters, the light will have been halved 10 times (a factor of 1024) by the time it reaches 1000m.  At 2000m, light is down to 1/~1,000,000 surface brightness. Etc.  The transparency of lake water will vary throughout the year as silt, algae, etc. concentrations change.  Deep lakes certainly will have a near-black zone for at least part of the year. "
"Though due to different reasons other than lack of light, in this case - lack of oxygen, I believe the creatures in meromictic lakes are also quite abnormal - and certainly worth mentioning amongst ""deep sea life"" or creatures not found commonly in nature.  I'd never even heard of such a thing until I was wandering around Qu√©bec and found Pink Lake. I found it fairly fascinating.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meromictic_lake  https://katatrepsis.com/2011/08/10/meromictic-lakes/  "

"> whereas at such a depth even a cannon cannot shoot because of the enormous pressure.""  What? I'm pretty sure the density of a medium, not its pressure, effects the drag on an object.  Edit: unless that's just a really poor way of saying that the pressure at that depth is more than the pressure inside the barrel of a cannon when it fires. In which case it's stupid to compare it to how freely a fish swims through the water."
Baikal also has a circulation process that deepwater lakes often lack... it supports life in the depths because of this.   There are papers on this.. I think this is one:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1997.42.5.0841/full  (edit: fixed URL)
Where do you learn this?
Completely unrelated, but Lake Superior has enough water to flood the entirety of North and South America to a depth of 1 foot, which is absolutely mind-boggling to me.
I was expecting something scary looking like the anglerfish - this one looks pretty normal. I wonder if there are scary looking deep freshwater fish... 
Huh. Pretty normal looking. I was expecting it to be more rubbery/jelly like. 
A cannonball is ejected from a cannon courtesy of a pressure difference caused by exploding gunpowder. If the ambient pressure around the cannon is greatly increased such that the pressure behind the ball upon firing is still less than the ambient pressure, the cannonball will not move, barring structural failure of the cannon itself. I guess if the cannon were submerged and allowed to equilibrate, then this wouldn't be a problem, but idk. You're right though, that's a weird analogy to use and I don't think it's appropriate here.
Well, pressure is calculated as P = r * g * h where:  * P is pressure  * r is the density of the fluid  * g is acceleration due to gravity  * h is the height of fluid above the object  So water has a density of 1000 kg per cubic meter (thanks metric system),   * r = 1000 kg / m^3  * g = 9.8 m / s^2  * h = 1642 m  thus   P =  (1000 kg / m^3 ) * (9.8 m / s^2 ) * 1642 m =16091600 kg*m/s^2 = 16091600 Newtons/m^2   P = **16091.6 Kilopascals**  Now assuming the cannon is a British 68 pounder, we can assume a nominal load of 16# of black powder -- roughly 7.25 kg.   Now assuming the pressure equalizes on both sides of the cannon ball as the cannon descends, and accounting for all factors: that differential will be 0 Kpa -- because wet gunpowder doesn't burn. Therefore the cannon will not fire.
try reposting the link without all the extra salad. Its blocked. This is what a typical wiley link looks like  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201309399/full
Yes, but as [this source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204001099) explains, during the last glacial maximum, Lake Baikal was covered with so much ice for so long that the ecosystem completely collapsed. Despite the fact that the lake has existed for tens of millions of years, the current ecosystem has only been evolving for less than 15,000 years.
There is no light *whatsoever* in most deep caves and mines. If you've never been in one before, it's a pretty jarring experience.
Did quick math as I was curious.  Area of North and South America combined: [42,549,000 km^2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas)  Volume of water in Lake Superior: [12,000 km^3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior)  1 foot = 0.3048 m  Volume of water needed to fill Americas upto 1 foot = 42,549,000 * 0.0003048 = 12,968.94 km^3 ~= 12,000 km^3  Math checks out.  edit: formatting
Lake Baikal, by comparison, has more than twice the volume of Lake Superior and exceeds the volume of all the Great Lakes combined (even though it has less than half the surface area of Lake Superior).  Lake Baikal blows my mind, and I‚Äôm a bit obsessed with it.
What's the point of looking scary if nobody around is able to see it? 
Something like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ext_3mUvuK0/Ta27rHKE98I/AAAAAAAAAZQ/gx15zGTQkDo/s1600/hatchetfish_face_killah.jpg) perhaps? Or maybe like [this.](https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/-KMiVRxm-GOQt9OZGM-bSydMgoI=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/filer/6a/53/6a53dc7d-13e6-4248-b57c-4937c9c569c6/baby_lizard_fish_web_asher_flatt.png)
Really? I was expecting more like the opposite. Something hard bodied like an Angler fish.
>Gunpowder will, in a confined space, build up a pressure of about 42 tons per square inch.   http://www.faversham.org/history/explosives/About_Gunpowder.aspx  That's 580 MPa.  The pressure at the bottom of the lake is 1642 m \* 9.81 m/s^(2) \* 1000 kg/m^(3) = 16 MPa.  That sucker's firing and it's firing hard.  I'm guessing the typical pressure of a cannon blast is lower because of expansion.  If there's pressure holding it in, then, it can become a lot more explosive.  (Not quite sure where to put this in this thread so I'm leaving it here.)
That's amazing! I just read it holds over 1/6th of the world's fresh surface water. How is that even possible?!
Deep-sea fish looking scary to us may just be a coincidence (they happen to have the same features that scare us in terrestrial predators, such as fangs and scales). Here is a deep-sea [Barreleye fish](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/25/article-0-03A96D95000005DC-712_634x436.jpg) that looks silly rather than scary.
"The reason it can ""withstand"" these enormous pressures is that it does not withstand them at all.   A submarine at 1600m would need to be made of thick steel, but only because it contains a void of air at a pressure of approximately 1 atmosphere. Free divers endure compression of their lungs and sinuses on descent (and expansion to original volume while ascending) while scuba divers who can't control their ascent rate can be killed by expanding the gas pockets in their bodies to many times their original volume.  However, this fish - or an ordinary ziplock bag full of nothing but water - has no problems changing depth because it contains no pockets of air that need to be reinforced and protected against crushing."
That's the highest theoretical pressure you would ever see in a cannon.  A black powder cannon might be around 25,000 psi or so, vs water pressure around 2,400 psi at a depth of 1642 meters.  The thing is by the time the projectile has reached the end of the barrel the pressure will be considerably lower.  I doubt anyone has tested this out but I could see the projectile never leaving the barrel of the gun.  You also have to consider that because the barrel will be filled with water it will absorb a considerable amount of energy from the projectile.  You're not just firing a cannonball out of the gun, you're firing a cannonball plus 10 gallons of water or whatever it is.
I have a few times, if you turn off the lights and you are deep enough there is no natural light it is pure black. There is no difference between eyes open or closed. You cannot see your hand infront of your face. You cannot see. Period.   It is a little unnerving, the first time it felt like something was directly infront of my eyes because you have nothing to focus on. If you ever get a chance try it!
That makes the ancient Chinese reference to Lake Baikal as one of the 'four seas' a lot more appropriate than it first appeared to me.
"Baikal is a rift valley filled with over a mile of water. Underneath that mile of water is over four miles of sediment.   So the actual *bottom* of the ""lake"" (read: rift) is anywhere from five to almost *seven miles* (11.3 km) below the surface. "
Speak for yourself, that might actually be one of the scariest fish I‚Äôve ever seen. 
And if you spend long enough in that kind of darkness, you start imagining that you *can* see things. Like people will swear that they can see you waving your hand in front of them in the pitch black, and if you ask them how many fingers you're holding up, they give a completely confident answer even though they have no idea.  The brain is weird.
> Barreleye fish  The two big green orbs behind where its eye sockets should be are actually its eyes. The head is transparent, as you can see, so the eyes can see through its own skull/head from inside. They are also always pointing upward to look for food above it.  I did a project on these guys during my undergrad. They're pretty neat.
"Many deep water creatures have evolved to depths by eliminating the swim bladder.  From Wikipedia,  >[""Many organisms develop swim bladders (gas cavities) to stay afloat, but because of the high pressure of their environment, deep-sea fishes usually do not have this organ. Instead they exhibit structures similar to hydrofoils in order to provide hydrodynamic lift.""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_fish?wprov=sfla1)  "
Holes to what?   It has a digestive tract, and gill membranes, and eye sockets, and reproductive organs, but there is no pressure differential across these 'holes'.  I would guess that this fish, given its crazy ascent/descent behavior, may not have a swim bladder like sharks, and instead regulates its fat levels to be neutrally bouyant at any depth, but if it did have one it would need to vent and oxygenate that swim bladder to maintain equilibrium pressure.
Proteins need to be flexible to do their jobs. Most proteins are fairly compressible so under sufficient pressure they will lose their flexibility and lose the ability to perform their tasks.  The proteins of deep sea organisms appear to be adapted to maintain their flexibility even with extreme pressures. 
Finally something I can help out with! Source: I'm a lecturer in the UK (roughly equiv. to assistant professor in the USA) specialising in life cycle assessment, particularly energy sources.  I wrote a paper that's open access, which you can find here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745  The TLDR is that solar is good in terms of climate change but generally less good in terms of other impacts. Overall it's typically not as good as wind or nuclear power. However, bear in mind two things:  1. Impacts are very dependent on location. E.g. solar installed here in the UK is worse than in Nevada or Spain because the impacts are all up-front but you get much more energy output in sunny countries, therefore better impacts per kWh. 2. Solar technology is moving fast. I actually have some updated figures that I'd love to share with you but they're not published yet, so they're not peer-reviewed. Reductions in impacts in the past few years have been considerable: about 50% reduction between 2005 and 2015. So for instance I now estimate a carbon footprint of about 45 g CO2-eq./kWh for a UK installation or 27 g in Spain. This contrasts with the figure of 89g you'll see in the paper I linked.
Here is another LCA (life cycle assessment) of different energy sources regarding electricity production, 2013:   >http://www.uni-obuda.hu/users/grollerg/LCA/hazidolgozathoz/lca-electricity%20generation%20technologies.pdf  Tech | kg CO2-eq per MWh ---|---                        Lignite |800‚Äì1300 Hard coal | 660‚Äì1050 Natural gas|  380‚Äì1000 Oil| 530‚Äì900 Biomass |8.5‚Äì130 Solar energy| 13‚Äì190 Wind| 3‚Äì41 Nuclear power| 3‚Äì35 Hydropower| 2‚Äì20  
Sorry to piggyback on the top answer, but if anyone's interested in impacts other than carbon footprint, here's an answer I wrote further down:  I wrote a paper that's open access, which you can find here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745  The TLDR is that solar is good in terms of climate change but generally less good in terms of other impacts.

EDIT: my first gilding - thank you!
This should be the top voted answer. While this data only looks at CO2, it demonstrates actual numbers and isn't just guesswork on the ecological footprint based on arbitrary dollar value.  Other data I've seen compares strongly with this data on other ecological matters, though I don't have any of those sources with me anymore.  It's also important to note that despite the popular idea about nuclear power being environmentally harmful and deadly, it's actually currently one of the safest and greenest solutions, compared to all other sources including solar power, as demonstrated by these and many other data.  Therefore, solar is a good environmentally friendly solution but nuclear power is greener, from start to finish, per kilowatt hour.
I read that the byproducts of making solar cells is highly toxic and isn't easily disposed of, is this true?   Edit: Thank you everyone for your replies and input on my question. To be clear, I wasn't asking the question to defend or endorse any type of energy production. I know they all have pros and cons and I've learned a lot about solar and nuclear energy from this post. Thanks again!
> It's also important to note that despite the popular idea about nuclear power being environmentally harmful and deadly, it's actually currently one of the safest and greenest solutions, compared to all other sources including solar power, as demonstrated by these and many other data.  Yup, among people who look at data and aren't ruled by the 24-hour news cycle, Nuclear looks to be an excellent transition technology with several variants and approaches that (properly)  make most of our reactors look like antiques.   PWRs also are just fine in the ocean (this coming from somebody who is an absurd nerd for sea life)...and WAY better than acidification ...the damage to pteropods in particular is pretty disconcerting. 
Well like many industrial processes there are some fairly nasty chemicals involved, so to an extent we're relying on good regulation. There have been a few cases in China where various toxic spills have occurred from solar plants (e.g. see [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030802595.html?referrer=emailarticle)).   There are also some issues with specific types of solar power, e.g. CdTe cells or CIGS cells, which contain cadmium. As you probably know, Cd is very toxic. There's currently a lot of work going on to eliminate Cd from all consumer equipment, so this should be solved in time.  In context though, it's important to remember that all of these impacts tend to be minimal compared to the environmental and health implications of coal power. So as long as we're replacing coal, it's still easily a benefit. And, of course, solar isn't much different to many other high tech industries, so it's not like the issues I mentioned above are uniquely problematic.  EDIT: a few people below are correctly pointing out that CIGS is copper-indium-gallium-selenium. However, normally there is cadmium in the buffer layer. There are basically 4 layers: molybdenum -> CIGS -> cadmium sulphide -> doped zinc oxide.
Thanks so much for all this great information.
Yes, we have this comparison in the paper I linked above. Generally natural gas has very low impacts - lower than solar - apart from climate change. Which is extremely annoying given that, you know, climate change is immensely important...  EDIT: just to clarify, I was talking about conventional gas here, e.g. from the North Sea. Shale gas cannot be described as 'very low impact'. We also have estimates for shale gas in the paper above, but you'll see that it's very variable depending on industry practices.
This is called bioregenerative life support, and in falls in the broader category of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Short answer is yes, but not infinite and not without disadvantages.  Note that plants aren't the only way to recycle oxygen. Currently they use water electrolysis to inject oxygen into their atmosphere, and use the resulting hydrogen to apply the Sabatier reaction with CO2. This yields methane as a waste product, and captures oxygen from CO2 in the form of water, so they can later apply electrolysis again and recycle oxygen.  A clear advantage of using plants would be trapping carbon into edible forms, so you'd be recycling not only oxygen but also food. However, not all plants have a 100% edible mass, and those who do usually offer very few calories if not negligible (e.g. lettuce).  A problem with plants is that they could die under some conditions, so this system isn't 100% reliable. And in any case, whether bioregenerative or artificially regenerative, you can never achieve a 100% reuse of ECLSS resources. But it's ok, you can get close enough and have them for a long time relying on very little supplies.  They are actively researching on this topic. Recently they've been able to grow lettuce in the ISS. 
"Whoa something I can answer - I worked on the Lunar Greenhouse Module at the University of Arizona!   Bioregenerative Life Support Systems could continually produce oxygen and some amount of food (our goal was always atmospheric conditioning with food production as a windfall of that). In fact, you kind of have to decide if you'd like the plants to focus on growing leaves for oxygen production or fruits for food production. Either way, there are a lot of challenges in feeding those plants. We proposed using composters to recycle human waste to make the system fully sustainable, as plants ""breathe"" pure water out which could then be utilized as drinking water as well. I don't know all the details about that part of it, as that wasn't my section. We also intended to use Fresnel lenses with fiber optic cables to deliver sunlight directly to the plants, with blue and red LEDs as a backup (it'd be placed underground because the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris).  Unfortunately, hydroponics would have difficulty in a low gravity environment like the ISS without some real specialized design, which the plants may not like. The moon would give us an environment that is a little more familiar to us and the plants.   Edit: the guys in charge of it did an AMA a couple years ago if anyone wants to look around for more info without leaving Reddit: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3npxoj/move_over_hollywood_we_are_roberto_furfaro_and/?st=J8LQQOVW&sh=91652fb3) "
How many plants would you need to create enough oxygen for, say, 6 men? I'm imaging a LOT of plants would be needed
I've seen different estimates for those requirements, ranging from a few 10s of m^2 to 100s of m^(2) per person. Most likely that it depends a lot on what you're planning to plant, and everyone has a different concept for that. How many plants is even harder to answer because they range a lot in size (i.e. you can have many small plants or few big ones).  What they all agree is that each person needs around 2500 kcal/day of food and 0.5-0.8 kg/day of oxygen.
On top of that, the amount of oxygen increases and decreases throughout the life cycle of either plants or algae. So at some point you would either have an abundance of oxygen (when fires would easily start) or a deficit. If the plants are just meant as a supplement that's all well and fine, but if you're planning to switch them out completely that becomes another issue to plan around.
"you could do that with plants as well (plant in rotations), assuming you are controlling environment and dont have a ""growing season""."
"It's all controlled by lighting, really, so no ""growing seasons"".  The biggest problem you actually have is watering plants, as well as the gravitropic response (roots down, plant up).  With no gravity, you tend to have some unusual effects.  We actually have a small centrifuge on many of our tests to generate artificial gravity, but large scale is obviously difficult.  I don't think there's enough space for this to be feasible on the ISS or deep space missions. "
The easy answer is no. If you mean combustion (or burning) of the bread, then there would be less calories because once combustion occurs (even partial) the byproducts are either indigestible or barely so.   If you mean dark toast, the kind you might get at 6 on the toaster, it has the same calories. The Maillard reaction is what drives browning and it is a complex process where proteins denature and bind to other proteins as well as carbohydrates and so forth created an amalgam of mixed molecules. Essentially this is what leads to that caramel/nuttiness you get when things are browned. However, this conformational change and denaturation does not decrease the calories because the overall building blocks are the same and still digestible.  However, if let‚Äôs say a byproduct of a Maillard reaction is an indigestible molecule that was previously digestible, you could argue that it is now lower in caloric value because it is no longer bioavailable energy.   Side note, a lot of people are talking about measuring calories by using a bomb calorimeter aka burning the item. This is no longer the method used for finding caloric value of food. Instead they find the net average of Atwater bioavailable nutrients and then use standardized values (e.g. 4 Kcal/g for Carbohydrates) to calculate the assumed caloric value. Again, this is obviously dependent on bioavailable sources of energy, not overall stored energy.  A perfect example of how a bomb calorimeter is not a feasible option, is Lettuce. Excluding the water (which is 95% of the material) lettuce is primarily fiber. Insoluble fiber in this case or in other words fiber we cannot breakdown (Cellulose). This material has no caloric value to us because it is not bioavailable (aside from small amounts created by gut fermentation thanks to helpful bacteria). So a piece of lettuce has a net caloric value of basically 0 in the Atwater system. In a bomb calorimeter however, it might have a much higher value because inside each of those cellulose walled cells is stored sugars, proteins, and so forth. Additionally, cellulose is essentially a starch made up of Beta-Glucose, however Beta-glucose is in a different conformation than Alpha-Glucose in starches we digest which means it is incompatible with our enzymes. However, combustion wise, cellulose and amylose (Alpha-glucose polysaccharide aka starch to most people) are equivalent in ‚ÄúCalories‚Äù in the context of a bomb calorimeter.    Again, this is not the case in bioavailability. The only animals that can actually get the full caloric potential from plant material are foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters, aka Cows and Horses. This is why they need multiple stomachs or a large cecum, in order to host helpful microorganisms to breakdown cellulose. Even Termites are not able to digest cellulose, but usually carry symbiotic organisms that can.   https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/  Addl. Note: /u/chuggsipas pointed out the fact that to be totally accurate about this discussion we have to really highlight that a Calorie at its base definition is the amount of energy required in order to raise one gram of water, by one degree Celsius. It‚Äôs important to distinguish this because while I do mention that a bomb calorimeter is not used for nutritional labeling values, it is the correct way to calculate calories in its true context. Another thing chugg brought up, and I absolutely agree with, is the fact that nutritional calories are a terrible measure of how our body uses energy. We do not just ingest and combust whatever is bioavailable, there are a multitude of processes that are dedicated to metabolism, storage, availability, etc that are not taken into account by flat caloric values. In fact evidence builds every year that quality of foods and caloric sources are more important than the overall calorie value. However, on some very basic level you can get a vague idea of your energy intake with the Atwater calorie system.   Edit: Added some clarification in regards to glucose in Cellulose.  Edit2: Fucked up and did L/D-Glucose instead of Alpha/Beta. Corrected that :X   Edit 3: Just wanted to say thank you to anyone who challenged or questioned anything I wrote. I definitely needed to add some information and make changes here and there. I appreciate it, especially since that‚Äôs what healthy discussion is about, and no one can be 100% correct, 100% of the time without some input from others! 
To go along with this question, as a banana goes from green to yellow to brown it gets sweeter because of I assume sugar.  Does a yellow banana have more calories than green-yellow banana?  I've always wondered.
Heating up food enough to cause a chemical change (toasting or burning) reduces the total caloric content. However, the heat also tends to make those calories more accessible by breaking down the sugars so your body is more likely to absorb more of them. 
Bomb calorimetry (by itself) is no longer considered a reliable method for determining the caloric content of food.  The caloric content you see on labels (which I assume is what OP is really interested in) is normally determined using the Atwater method, which accounts for digestibility of food among other factors including calorimetry. 
I guess this was the old fashioned way.  Today we are able to tell which ingredients are digestible at which efficiency.  Using chemical calculus and also taking the old fashioned way into account brings you closer to how much usable calories a food really has.  Eg. If you burn 1 kg of propane, you get about 110,000 kcal of energy. But if you eat 1 kg of propane, you become a scary surprise for whoever has to burn your body. 
I forgot to add that some foods increase in caloric value upon cooking them because the nutrients become more bioavailable. A great example of this are potatoes or carrots, where heating the starchy plants causes breakdown and rupture of most of the cells holding starch molecules, which allows the starches to be directly metabolized. So the Atwater caloric value increases, but the actual caloric value (of potential energy for let‚Äôs say combustion) has not changed, which again shows you that this is an example of accessibility to nutrients and not overall energy changes. 
as the fruit ripens large structural sugars start breaking down into smaller more palatable ones. some of these large sugars are not so easily digested, and thus their chemical energy would not be bioavailable for humans.
For the most part, no. The primary difference lies in that as the banana ripens, complex carbohydrates and starches are broken down into simpler sugars over time. This is why a very ripe banana tastes sweeter than a green banana. Carbohydrates contain 4 kcal/g if they are simple or complex. Complex carbs just take longer to break down, which would also result in the banana's glycemic index changing.  Edit: Wow, people really like talking about bananas.
"Follow up: would that mean, theres a possibility that burned toast could have ""more"" calories than unburnt. I heard that cooking makes food easier to digest hence more calories?"
This is why humans cook food. Gotta feed the gigantic brain nutrients and calories (its huge compared to the rest of our body). Also why I find the raw food movement a tad questionable. Unless it's for weight loss. 
So you're saying greener bananas are harder to digest?
Yes, you are right. Experiments on snakes found they absorbed 60% more calories from cooked food when compared to uncooked, and humans as similar.   But it also depends on the foods themselves. Some, like milk, eggs, fruit and many more are pretty much the same, cooked or uncooked. Plants and meat yield more nutrients and energy when cooked - eg a raw carrot is nowhere near as useful than a cooked carrot.  Humans have a significantly shortened gut when compared to what it 'should' be, and that is likely driven by obtaining more calories by cooking. This shortened bowel in turn frees up energy we would otherwise be spending to digest for our brain (or so a really interesting theory on human evolution goes). In short: cooking allowed our brain to expand.  EDIT: but note that this might not extend to this scenario since the bread was already milled to flour, fermented and cooked. All those processes make it easier for us to extract calories. Toasting might not add anything here, and certainly does reduce calories fractionally by burning sugars and starches we would otherwise digest.
I've only recently learned about how much calories our brain actually requires. With such a large brain to body mass ratio, it seems obvious that we need to consume more calories than our bodies would normally be able to absorb raw. Large animals with large brains and correspondingly large digestive systems, like elephants, can eat all day to fuel their brains. But we needed to compensate for our comparatively small digestive systems, so we began cooking food before consumption. This also means we wouldn't need as much food to satisfy our caloric requirements, meaning less hunting and gathering and more time to make tools, invent religion and language, and raise children.  >Glucose is virtually the sole fuel for the human brain, except during prolonged starvation. The brain lacks fuel stores and hence requires a continuous supply of glucose. It consumes about **120 g daily**, which corresponds to an energy input of about **420 kcal (1760 kJ)**, accounting for some **60% of the utilization of glucose by the whole body in the resting state**. Much of the energy, estimates suggest from 60% to 70%, is used to power transport mechanisms that maintain the Na+-K+ membrane potential required for the transmission of the nerve impulses. The brain must also synthesize neurotransmitters and their receptors to propagate nerve impulses. Overall, glucose metabolism remains unchanged during mental activity, although local increases are detected when a subject performs certain tasks. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/
He's saying in a green banana the sugar is there, but you won't be able to extract it until it turns yellow.
Why were snakes used in those experiments? I've never actually seen a study where snakes were used
 > Experiments on snakes found they absorbed 60% more calories from cooked food when compared to uncooked, and humans as similar  Well damn. All those games where cooked food gives you more health is actually kinda correct!
"> But we needed to compensate for our comparatively small digestive systems, so we began cooking food before consumption.  To put this into evolutionarily-accurate terms, we didn't start cooking one day (or over the course of generations) because our brains had gotten so big that we *had* to cook. There was nothing in our instincts to say ""I need more calories! Cook those potatoes!""  The more plausible explanation would be that our brain size had been limited by our calories *until* pre-humans started cooking. Once these smaller-brained ancestors started cooking, there were more calories available, and so larger brains became possible (or, specifically, they became a positive fitness, rather than a negative one).  (That's all under the assumption that bigger brains require cooking, of course, which is actually [not well supported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842772/).)"
He's really saying that their chemical energy would not be bioavailable for humans.
I don't know for sure (this is just a vaguely educated guess), but snakes seem like a great animal to learn about digestion from. Firstly, they expend very little energy by moving around, so immediately you've got a pretty decent control on your digestion environment.   Secondly, they have a stomach pH really similar to a human (around 1.5 ish, ours is between 1.5 and 3.5ish).   Thirdly, the fact that they don't move much when they're digesting (it takes up all their energy) combined with their really simple body shapes allows scientists to use monitoring equipment on them really easily. It's easy to put a sensor with a wire on it on a piece of food and have said snake eat it whole (and not chew it to pieces). The snake is too busy sleeping and digesting to notice a wire from a probe coming out of its mouth and it allows for pretty comprehensive monitoring of all the things going on in its stomach.  I don't know exactly why for sure and the actual reason for that's particular experiment might be different, but those factors make a lot of sense to me.   EDIT: here's a source that vaguely backs up my tenuous attempt at an explanation:  http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/10/1600
Sorry. Starches are just as bioavailable as sugars, they just take longer to absorb.
A plantain is a banana, it‚Äôs just not a Cavendish. There are different cultivars of banana, and the Plantain is one that has a higher starch content so it has found prolific use as a ‚Äúcooking banana‚Äù. 
If they‚Äôre encased in vacuoles behind cellulose cell walls they‚Äôre much harder to access. 
As inhuman snakes are it's still safe to presume it's more accurate than setting the food on fire.
Grass. Grazing animals live off of it, so it clearly has caloric value but a person would starve to death even if they had an unlimited supply of it. Cows have a 4 chamber stomach to slowly digest it, we can't.
"It is indeed possible to yo-yo in space. The only thing is that if you ""free wheel it"" (sorry not a yo-yo expert) it tends to float around. It will however try to keep its orientation due to gyroscopic effects. This is sometime used on spacecraft to either stabilise them or to turn them (with moment gyros).  [Here is a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni4j5K4Lz3o) of my favorite astronaut Dr Don Pettit inventing new yoyo tricks on board the international space station."
You don't need gravity to yoyo. Think of how you can throw a yoyo out perpendicular to the ground and have it return.  The way a yoyo works is this: the string isn't tight to the bearing which is how you can walk the dog etc. If you cause enough snap, it starts to wind, then due to the spinning, causes it to wind back on the string itself. Gravity plays no real part in basic yoyoing, only in certain tricks
Yes. A yo-yo's functionality is not based on gravity.  You throw it, the string strains, and bounces back.  To be honest, a Yo-yo in space would bounce back harder I believe.  The gravity would not be affecting the yo-yo's repercussion. Long story short, yes, it would actually make a yo-yo more effective; or annoying depending on how you treat it.
"Wow, nice video. If he can hold the ""around the world"" trick for 1.5 hours straight (one full ISS orbit) it will be the first time that a Yoyo would go completely around the world while doing ""around the world."" Probably.Ôªø"
Am I right in thinking that extended periods in freefall can cause the sinus issues that he seems to have in the video?
> perpendicular to the ground   Parallel?
Sadly even the longest spinning yo yo's can't currently do that. We've focused too much on space technology and not enough on yo yo technology and now we're suffering for it. 
Yes, in a zero-g environment fluids get pulled into your upper body (head and chest) and gives astronauts a puffy face and skinny legs.   Don Pettit also has naturally a bit of a weird accent/way of talking.
he means parallel, but you can also throw a yoyo perpendicular to the ground and have it return
"Though if we had focused on yo yo technology and not space technology so as to do the ""around the world"" trick for 1.5 hours, we wouldn't have the space technology to fly around the world while doing it. It's quite the conundrum."
Do they actually get _pulled_ into your upper body, or is it just the result of there being no gravity which usually pulls the fluids _away_ from those areas?
I actually think he means perpendicular. Just yo-yoing straight up and down. 
"I feel as though inventing any yo-yo technology advanced enough to make possible a 1.5-hour ""around the world"" would produce the possibility of space flight as a byproduct. Like how *our* space flight technology gave us Tang as a result. We didn't stare up at the Moon and say ""we should create a powdered orange drink with vitamin C, maybe trying to get to the moon will result in that."" But it did.      If a person were to stare up at the moon and try to figure out how to yo a yo-yo with such a sustained yo, space flight is inevitable yo."
The second one.  Or bodies work to pump liquids into our upper bodies to counter act gravity, but in zero G, you still have your body pumping extra liquid into your upper body, but don't have gravity pulling it away.
He means parallel.   > You don't need gravity to yoyo. Think of how you can throw a yoyo out perpendicular to the ground and have it return.  That doesn't make sense because gravity affects a yo-yo when you throw it perpendicular to the ground, and it doesn't (much) when you throw it parallel to the ground.  So clearly he meant parallel
Well that just confirms my theory then. The invention of Tang resulted in space flight. Humans invented the yo-yo long before we started exploring space, if we would have bothered to improve our yo-yo's we would have gotten to space sooner.
The second one. This would require changing an integral part of how your body distributes fluids.  It might never go away at all, there's not really any selective pressure to make the changes, so it might always be there.
"Yes, if my understanding of this article is correct: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/science/25qna.html  (I hope nytimes is an acceptable source, even if not academic)  In the linked article, John D. Kubiatowicz, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley says that for a kindle with 4 Gigabyte memory, this would mean a rough increase in weight of 10^‚Äì18 grams.  For your situation of a 60GB phone, this would mean  (60Gb/4Gb) * (10^-18 grams) = 1.5 √ó 10^-17 grams.  So certainly less than what you would be able to feel.  While I originally thought this would be because the storage would use extra electrons, the article/Prof. Kubiatowicz say otherwise:  ""Although the total number of electrons in the memory does not change as the stored data changes,‚Äù Dr. Kubiatowicz said, the trapped ones have a higher energy than the untrapped ones. A conservative estimate of the difference would be 10^‚Äì15 joules per bit.  ""As the equation E=mc2 makes clear, this energy is equivalent to mass and will have weight.""  It is my understanding that most/all mobile phones use flash memory for storage so the linked article about flash memory in Kindles would be applicable here.  Please let me know (or just delete this outright) if I am mistaken.  *edited to fix exponent formatting    "
"Most comments here are assuming that ""empty"" space on the phone is occupied by 0 bits, and that new data will switch some to 1. In reality, there's no guarantee that those bits are 0, since most operating systems have clever bookkeeping to allow regions of memory to be marked as empty without having to overwrite that entire section with 0 bits.  Your meta question appears to be: does data have mass? And the answer to that question, and in my mind one of the cool things about data, is that it does not.   A knit quilt with intricate, colorful patterns weighs the same as a gray, featureless one. A book filled with random scribblings weighs the same as an equivalent dictionary. We're a species that evolved to match patterns; data is just patterns: human-interpretable arrangements of things. "
"As far as I know, it's applicable. But, as the article states, that would be magnitudes less than just fluctuations due to battery level (""one hundred-millionth""). And at that small scale, we wouldn't be able to measure it anyways."
It would be even less than that because the example is not calculating unused vs used space, it's calculating all bits set to 0 vs all bits set to 1.  EDIT: I was wrong, they accounted for this and the math is for a 50-50 split of 1s and 0s.
This should be higher up. Even if a 1 has more mass than a 0 or vice versa, memory being more or less full doesn't mean that it will weigh more or less. A phone with 0GB used could have more 1s than a phone with 60GB used.
"To add to this most storage devices don't have their unused space kept at all 0's, the unused space is usually random 1's and 0's. It's entirely possible that by saving files to your phone you could end up with more 0's and less 1's than you started with and your phone could end up ""lighter""."
"It's not that you're measuring extra electrons, in fact, the electrons DON'T move from the memory to the battery or vice versa. The number of electrons in the memory stays the same, but the transistors holding a ""high"" value have trapped the electrons in a higher energy state and, therefore, provide more mass."
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Block_erasure) flash memory erases to all 1s, so it would *always* be lighter.
I don't believe for a second that the surface web was just 170tb in 2014.
On flash devices empty blocks are usually erased in the background when possible (see [TRIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_\(computing\))), since erasure is an expensive operation and doing it ahead of time means you'll get less hiccups later on when you want to write a bunch of new data quickly.
Ok, this will likely get buried, but I'll give an explanation.  After you ingest (swallow) water, it goes to your stomach. There, it is slowly released to your small intestine to be absorbed and pass to your bloodstream. It takes water between 10 and 40 minutes to pass to your small intestine and be absorbed. The speed of this depends on how much water, the temperature (cold water will be released slower), if there is something else in the stomach, etc. But, in general, it doesn't matter whether you chug a bottle of water down in 10 seconds or slowly sip it in 10 minutes. It will all end up in your bloodstream in about the same time.  The only thing that can make a difference is whether you vomit the water that you are ingesting. You stomach vomits its contents in response to a series of things (whether it senses that something you ate may be rotten or dangerous, whether there is a bad smell, etc), and one of those things that the stomach takes into account is how full it is. So ingesting water in small sips can help avoid vomiting, and that is what's recommended when for example children have gastroenteritis. But if you don't vomit the water that you swallow, it doesn't matter whether you swallowed it in 10 seconds or 10 minutes.  Edit: Wow, thanks for all the upvotes. Turns out it didn't get buried after all! This is 1/4 of my total karma right there! Glad you liked it!  Edit2: it's actually not clear whether cold water will be released (and thus absorbed) slower. As someone pointed out below, studies on this seem to be contradictory. 
"Piggybacking off this question:   How much water does someone REALLY need? Drinking the ""8-10 glasses"" a day gives me clear urine and over 25 trips to the bathroom, whereas if I drink 5+ glasses a day, my urine is still clear and I feel hydrated without the bladder pains/constant bathroom trips. "
I imagine there will be individual variety to this, but is it possible that your body learns how to deal with your particular style? Meaning, is it an adaptable feature? Sorry if it's a stupid question, but I got really curious :) 
Pretty off subject but does that mean if someone was trying to eat less during meal times then they should drink a glass of cold water right before so that their stomach will feel fuller? The colder the better? 
"The 8 glasses of water a day thing is a myth. The sentence following the one that prescribed that amount was ""Most of this is contained in prepared foods"". Meaning you are already getting some water (or even most of the water you need) in the foods you eat and other beverages you drink.   Source: a [ny times article authored by a pediatrician](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html?mcubz=0)"
There's no magic number. Just have to pay attention to your body. Learn the early signs of being thirsty and anticipate your needs for the day. Sitting in an office? You won't need much water. Moving around outside all day in any amount of sun or heat? You'll need more than 8-10 glasses.
I think what you're referring to is the caloric requirements of regulating your body's temperature when adding the colder liquid. Your body will work to keep a stable overall temperature and burns calories to do such.   But someone with more medical knowledge should be able to help with the actual retention of fluid in the stomach. I suspect it's just an increase in heat produced to compensate and the water flows the same no matter what temperature.   Edit: I was incorrect on water retention. Check the rest of the comments for a good explanation.
That's actually not true. You should drink at certain intervals and not conserve water. It's counter-intuitive but it's the right thing to do.  US Army recommends drinking water at regular intervals. http://www.aircav.com/survival/asch13/asch13p02.html
In theory, the stomach will be fuller if you drink water, yes. And cold water will take longer to pass. But it's not that simple once you add food and hunger to the equation. First, the food you are eating is likely warmer than your body, so when mixed with the cold water, both will countereffect each other. And, more importantly, how much you want to eat doesn't only depend on how fast you fill up your stomach. It depends partly on how your body interprets what it is eating/drinking. It is a very complex process that involves taste; your brain; the fat, protein, and starch content of what you eat; the spiciness of the food, what foods are available, etc. It's very hard to predict whether drinking cold or hot water is going to make you eat more or less without actually studying in different conditions.  Edit: it turns out that it's not even clear that cold water takes longer to pass. Some studies show that cold water at 4C (close to ice temperature) can pass faster than water at 20C (at room temp).
I just read on Wikipedia that drinking five to six ice-cold glasses of water would burn an extra 10 calories a day. That would take 6 months to burn 1 lb. of fat.  I don't know about anyone else but that sounds like a lot to me.
The cool thing about the (large) calorie unit is that it is defined as the energy required to heat 1 litre of water by 1 degree Celsius, which makes this calculation quite easy. If we only look at the energy required to heat the water, and assume ice-cold water is 0 degrees, it'll take 37 calories to heat 1 litre to body temperature. A quick google search reveals that 1lb of body fat contains about 3500 calories of energy, which requires you to drink a little under 100 litre of ice-cold water to burn.
In general, spiciness will make you feel fuller with a lower amount of food.
Most of the major points regarding refeeding syndrome and hyponatremia have already been covered in this thread. So I'd like to point out a different issue with severe dehydration. As the body becomes increasingly dehydrated, it becomes increasingly difficult to actually get water in.   This is especially true when you consider one of the most common causes of dehydration is fluid loss due to GI illness. (vomiting and diarrhea). This is even doubly so with infants. It's not possible to rehydrate simply by drinking. You cause more vomiting, more loss, and risk aspirating and drowning. And with dehydration comes hypovolemia. There's so little volume of blood in your veins that they are virtually impossible to start an IV without blowing the vessel.   The most extreme treatment for this is [Intraosseous Infusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraosseous_infusion) , where fluids are injected directly into the bone marrow. In laymen terms, we jam a straw into your shin and pour saline/meds/etc.  There isn't really a point of no return on life, so long as you're still alive. But that's not to say you won't have lasting ill effects. Lifelong dialysis due to kidney failure is a bitch.
Not entirely sure there is one, but there is Refeeding Syndrome: where the influx of calories in the form of glucose leads to a large amount of insulin release, which in turn causes electrolyte abnormalities, namely hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia, which in particular can lead to arrhythmias and heart failure.
I see this effect often enough at work as a 911 paramedic. Dying is dying. Doesn‚Äôt matter if its on the cusp of thirst, hunger, heart attack, or difficulty breathing, while dying the body reacts the same. As mentioned previously, this effect was also seen in concentration camps. When people are dying they have a physiological strength to hold on until help arrives. Their willpower keeps the body going (placebo effect) until help can intervene. Many times as soon as help walks in the door the victim will stop struggling to live because they can now have someone else worry about that. I see my critical patients decompensate  or get worse often due to this type of response. Edit: as for the second part of your question....yes. Many times they are aware they are dying and are terrified. I‚Äôve also had patients tell me details of the scene afterward while they clinically dead.
"Rabbits have a condition known as GI Stasis, where food stops being digested, due to a combination of factors, including eating less, less movement of material through the system, and buildup of ""bad"" bacteria in the GI tract.  Humans suffer a superficially similar problem, known as gastroparesis, where the muscles in the GI tract are not working as well as they should, thus material moves more slowly, and less nutrients are absorbed.  So even though you eat something, you may not be able to get any nutrition from it. And that is just one of many mechanisms, you could have issues with production of digestive enzymes, bile, stomach acid, etc, which can stop or slow down absorption.  Another way to look at it, though, is this; if you have a person dying of starvation (or rather, massive organ failure, because of a lack of nutrients), who just died, but their cells are mostly still alive, if you pour food and water down their throats, do they come back to life? Of course not. It's just a question of what fails and how, and that point of no return is probably highly variable, and perhaps subject to what sort of medical care a person can get."
That's what happened to victims of the Holocaust right? Where some of them where immediately fed after being saved and many died of that
Fed chocolate to be exact. It was part of the field rations due to its high calorie density. Its still MREs to this day
"The University of Wales's Centre for Explosion Studies, in research commissioned by the Institute of Physics, ""estimate that severe structural damage would have been sustained by buildings up to half a kilometre away,"" razing everything within 40 metres, and destroying Westminster Abbey.  [Here's a New Scientist article.](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4338-gunpowder-plot-would-have-devastated-london/)  The author notes amongst other things that they assumed for this calculation an equal amount of TNT, a more powerful but better studied explosive. They justify this increase in explosive yield with Fawkes' expertise as someone well versed in the use of explosives for military purposes, though it's not clear how much of a difference it would make. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent) lists the relative effectiveness of black powder as half that of TNT. "
I‚Äôm honestly ~~surprised~~ blown away this hasn‚Äôt been posted yet but they attempted to recreate this scenario on an English program in ~~2017~~. [check it out here, it‚Äôs a HUGE explosion.](https://youtu.be/XTwbkYYdZBw) Cant answer any questions about physics, but I hope the video gives you what you are looking for.   *edit: skip to ~49 min in to see the explosion. Also Richard Hammond from Top Gear is in it.   Not 2017, made in 2005 apparently. You all are right, Hammond looks way too young for this to be last year. 
Sidney Alford, a well respected expert in explosives, recreated the plot based on historical data. Here's the video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTwbkYYdZBw  It's an hour long so if you want to see the explosion skip to [50:00](https://youtu.be/XTwbkYYdZBw?t=3000)
Black powder is a low explosive, which means I deflagrates rather the detonates.   What that means in lames terms is explosives are measured in how fast they burn, which is what a conventional explosive does, just at a very rapid speed. So as a low explosive black powder in and of itself is not very destructive when compared to a high explosive. What makes black powder effective is containing it. Contain it in a barrel and it will propel a projectile. Contain it in a pipe and it becomes a mechanical explosion causing damage by way of the pipe breaking at great velocity do to build up in pressure (think coke bottle shaken then tossed up in the air). Because it‚Äôs a low brisance (ability to cut) it‚Äôs not very effective at damaging hardened structures. The main way it would be effective is if it was able to build up enough pressure in the tunnel or building that it was placed it. And other factors like the building materials, amount of earth it was under etc would all factor in. With that, the quality of black powder and amount of moisture as well. There are instances of huge black powder explosions, and instances of not so huge. There would have to be some real study and testing done to say for sure, but what I can promise is that there is no chance it would have gone unnoticed. I hope that answers a least part of the question. I will clarify where I can, if you have questions. 
"It would have easily destroyed parliament.  The BBC reproduced it on a show a few years back in show called ""The Gunpowder Plot - Exploding the Legend""  The short video link...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rEvCf0dH9I  The full show...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTwbkYYdZBw  Basically it would have leveled a 40/50 metre area around parliament and send debris up to a few kilometers away."
"The gunpowder plot was believed to involve 2500kg of powder.  For a real-life comparison, the ""Battle of the Crater"" during the US Civil War involved the use of 3600kg of gunpowder buried 20 feet below a fortified trench occupied by the Confederacy.  The detonation resulted in an oblong crater that was about 52 meters by 37 meters, and 9 meters deep."
"I don't think you can watch that clip and think, ""Yeah he woulda lived no problem"". That's an insane amount of powder they acquired."
I watched this when it was on TV originally. Still gotta love the old guy at 50:30 take shakey photos on his own rubbish camera despite the whole thing being captured with multiple high quality slow motion TV cameras üòÇ
Not being from England, I always assumed the House of Lords was a much larger building. Of course that much gunpowder would blow it to smithereens. 
"Black powder is a low speed explosive, but if it's fine ground and well-tamped, it will just explode just fine. The Oklahoma City bombing was done with ANNM but mostly just straight Ammonium Nitrate, which is even slower than black powderm, and it blew up the Murrah Building no problem.  That much explosive, well-contained (e.g. like an undercroft), would have no problem leveling the building above it. In fact, a low speed explosive is generally better as a ""pushing"" vs ""cutting"" explosive. If you wanted to make steel cutting or counterforce charges to bring down the supports of a building, blackpowder is an awful choice. If you just want to heave up a huge mass of earth, then it does the job just fine."
Would the fact it was buried under a trench create a high-pressure environment that would amplify the damage? Would it be possible to replicate in the place Fawkes' gunpowder was at? Black powder is much more slowly burning than TNT, and how sealed the environment is could be crucial to determine the built up pressure, and thus the damage.  There is a historic basis how meaningful this is, albeit on a smaller bomb scale. During the [20 July plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot), several German officers tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler using a briefcase bomb. To avoid setting off metal detectors, they had to use plastic explosives wrapped in paper rather than a metal casing, despite the fact that at the time of WWII, plastic explosives were not as advanced or high-pressure as later explosives like C4. They expected Hitler to have a conference in a bunker and had the bomb placed there, where the sealed environment would act like one big casing, allowing the bomb to build up pressure that would kill everyone inside. But instead, Hitler had the meeting in a regular building, with windows and other gaps. As a result, the detonated bomb dissipated its explosive force, and Hitler survived the explosion, albeit with some injuries like a shattered eardrum.
> The gunpowder plot was believed to involve 2500kg of powder.  Barrels were [100 pounds](https://www.jamestowncooperage.com/fort-loudoun-gunpowder-casks.html) of gunpowder in the 18th and 19th century. [Another cite.](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/34261/how-much-does-a-barrel-of-gunpowder-cost) Not sure if they'd be more in the 17th century.  100 pounds, 36 barrels, that's 1636 kg, rather less than the 2500 kg cited in the article. The brisance of black powder is substantially less than TNT, and the confinement would be rather less than when buried.  Plus, there's no telling the condition of the gunpowder (moist versus dry) nor how well it was made.  But even if it didn't destroy the building, it probably would have rendered it unusable.
If you're going to take out parliament, you have to make sure you don't miss.
The House of Lords is actually just a single chamber inside of the Palace of Westminster which is a much larger building. For this recreation it looks small because they only recreated the House of Lords and the basement underneath it rather than model the entire Palace of Westminster which would've been a gargantuan task. Since the House of Lords was where the targets would be and all of the gunpowder would be in the basement beneath, they only needed to build those two to see how large the explosion would've been.
This would have been a major issue. Some of the powder would have detonated, but much of the gunpowder would have been dispersed and burned. 
"In an enclosed environment, the TNT equivalency for black powder is about right as an estimate of the damage it would cause. The pressure would cause the reaction rate to go up high enough that it would almost certainly be a detonation. Contained black powder can do real damage.   If you want a laugh, lookup ""anvil shooting"" on Youtube. It's mental.  This Hitler thing is really interesting. Human bodies are remarkably resilient to short duration overpressure and laymen tend to underestimate just how fast pressure drops off with distance. Without an enclosure like a room to reflect the pressure back or some sort of shrapnel, straight up lumps of high explosive are remarkably ineffective at killing humans for how much energy there is. "
"An experimental recreation of the House of Lords Undercroft (using concrete) found that the gunpowder Fawkes intended to use would have shattered the building's foundations and propelled the wooden floors upward with such acceleration that everyone in the building would have been killed instantly. They further conclude that the amount of gunpowder was actually excessive. But of course, they also caution that this assumes the gunpowder ""was in good order"".  https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501865/Guy-Fawkes-had-twice-the-gunpowder-needed.html"
The cellars under parliament were available to hire by private companies/ citizens.  So it wasn‚Äôt unusual to store lots of barrels, and was accumulated relatively slowly.
"Bear in mind the modern house of lords is not really anything like the one Fawkes had in his sights... IIRC in Fawkes' era it was a much more humble stone building, rather than the gothic fantasy that is there today.       Wikipedia has a plan of the site in the ""plot"" section of the article.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder\_Plot   "
In the case of The Gunpowder Plot, the barrels were deliberately covered and surrounded with stone, wood and iron. I wonder if this was specifically to help the barrels burn as much as possible to completion. Fawkes had served in the military and was said to be familiar with gunpowder, so he probably knew what he was doing.
OK - yes, that would have been the reason - keep the detonating powder compressed, even for an extra millisecond or two, so that more of it would detonate before being dispersed.
"Early on in the history of computing, programs would be written as a sequence of operations in assembly language, which basically means they would be written in terms of actual physical operations for the computer architecture to perform, e.g. copy this numeric value to that memory location.  That's obviously very time consuming and difficult, and it means that programs have to be rewritten for each new type of processor that you run them on. So to make it easier, higher level languages that are more human readable were created, with commands that basically work as shortcuts for all the repetitive number-juggling required in assembly language. So you have to write a compiler in assembly language, which doesn't require compiling.   It's interesting that you ask ""did **he** compile it at all"", since the first person to write a compiler was actually a woman, Grace Hopper :)"
This confusion comes from a misunderstanding about what compiling is.  These days we commonly say we don't work in bits or machine code. That isn't exactly true. People who work in hardware do work in bits when they're developing a new kind of circuit.  When microprocessors were first created everybody worked with bits. Flip this to on and then that causes this and you can flip these to represent a number and flip this switch to move it into a special register and picked up by the clock.  At first that worked fine. Kind of the way you don't need labels for the 20 or so light switches in your house. But after a while they wanted a) more complicated systems and b) people with less experience to be able to contribute.  So that's when early forms of what we would call assembly language came on. It abstracted all the little switches away into a smaller set of instructions like move data, add data, subtract data etc.  Pretty soon after that things got too complicated again so some people who found themselves writing the same combinations and order of these instructions sought to abstract these hundreds of lines of simple instructions into a single line instruction. So they wrote a program that would take a program of five lines in this new langauge and convert it into the hundreds of lines of assembly language.  This has happened multiple times over and each time the compiler/interpreter etc is written by people who *can* write in the lower level language the compiler produces but would rather save themselves the keystrokes.  EDIT: My source is 22 years of programming, 18 years of software engineering. These days I leverage some of the lessons and motivations for developing compilers into developing custom tooling for other software engineers in mid to large scale organizations.
Please bear with the first bit of this as I establish a framework understanding.  Machines execute machine code. Compilers do *not* compile directly to machine code. They compile the code into to *assembly* which is then *assembled* into machine code.  Machine code has two parts, ~~zero and one~~ operands (what to do and where (registers) to do it\*) and data. Depending on the number of 'bits' the machine is, these can all have varying lengths of bits.  Now that we understand what machine code is and how it's structured, let's look at what assembly code is.  Assembly code is *human readable machine code*.  We (humans) give the operands *mnemonics* (names) and logically divide this into three parts to make things easier to remember for us. No matter what, the same operand mnemonic will *always* turn into the same sequence of binary.   So assembly let's us turn a 'line' of binary from      010011110101000001010010 010100100100010101000111 01000100010000010101010001000001  Into      OPR REG, DATA  So now we know what assembly is, and how it's written. How does a machine turn assembly into machine code?  Why with an assembler of course! Usually assemblers are 'programmed' on paper, by hand writing the assembly you would normally type to later be run through an assembler. The next step is. . . Translating the assembly of your assembler to binary yourself! Hooray how exciting!  Even still we keep it a bit more human readable than direct binary we use a system called hexadecimal to represent binary. A symbol of hex is four bits, and is as follows.      0 0000     1 0001     2 0010     3 0011      ...     F 1111   Once you have your program translated from assembly to hex, you queue the program in a hex editor. A hex editor is a peripheral attached to the machine which stores the binary of your program which you enter using hex, and sends it to be executed once you are finished.  So, now we understand how we get machines to do anything. Let's see how we can reach the ability to compile a compiler.  1) Hand write an assembler in assembly/hex.  2) Enter your assembler into a machine with a hex editor  3) Write your compiler in assembly and assemble it.  4) Write your compiler in the language your compiler compiles.  5) Assemble the compiler.  6) GOTO 4  That's how you get a basic compiler.   Fun fact: A compiler written in the language it compiles is called a *self-hosting compiler*.   ***  Things you may want to dig into for further reading.

">first person to write a compiler was actually a woman, Grace Hopper  Grace Hopper coined the term ""compiler"" but she only wrote a ""linker"" (albeit an important component of a full compiler). The first compiler was written by Corrado B√∂hm, in 1951, for his PhD thesis."

Slightly off topic but may be mildly interesting: people still code in assembly even to this day for small low-power processors such as DSPs where every clock cycle counts. It‚Äôs getting less and less common as C compilers are more efficiently targeted to these custom devices, but it still happens in a lot of places.   Of course, it‚Äôs not exactly the same process as the early days. Instead of memorising / looking up the sequence of 1s and 0s for ‚Äústore number 1 in register r2‚Äù you write a statement such as ‚Äústr 1, r2‚Äù and the toolchain translates that to the appropriate binary. It‚Äôs like an intermediate layer between the machine code and the higher level code. And you get a pretty-ish IDE running on your desktop rather than using punchcards. But overall you still have to have an in-depth knowledge of the underlying processor hardware and its capabilities, and the patience of a saint :) for what it‚Äôs worth, some people really enjoy it. 
Thanks, nice to know! (No sexism intendedüôÇ)
One of my favorite fun facts about one of my favorite video games of all time:  Despite the existence of these higher level languages, Roller Coaster Tycoon creator Chris Sawyer wrote 99% of the game in assembly. 
This is correct. And I think it's useful to understand that most compilers are compiled iteratively, called bootstrapping: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)  As an example: Rust is written in Rust and compiled with the Rust compiler. They did this by first writing a bare-bones Rust compiler in OCaml, used that compiler to compile a Rust compiler written in Rust, and then began compiling each new version of Rust with the previous version's compiler. OCaml does the same thing: it's written in OCaml that was bootstrapped with a compiler written in C. C itself is written in C, and was bootstrapped with an assembler. The assembler itself translates assembly language to machine code which is what actually runs on the processor.  So once we got the first steps down (e.g. C to assembly to machine code) everything was built up from there.

"> but she only wrote a ""linker""  I know you didn't mean to minimize the importance of this, but just for the sake of anyone reading...

"> Grace Hopper led the team that developed A-0 and they were the first to use the word compiler.  The word yes, but what they called ""compiler"" back then, we call a ""linker"" now, so it's misleading to ignore the change of meaning when talking about the history of compilers."
Interesting side-note though: Some early card-punching machines didn't actually require you to memorize the 0's and 1's. They were more like a typewriter where you could press something that had a meaning, and that would punch the instruction/value into the card. I guess you could call that a very low-level type of assembly compilation... albeit physically implemented.
You weren't sexist, but I smiled when I read your question because I knew the person was a woman.
"*Rust is written in Rust and compiled with the Rust compiler.

Also, perhaps irrelevantly..  *""If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.""* -Carl Sagan  (edit: just checked the video, and corrected the Sagan quote... for reference, de-bugging is also important.)"
"Kind of. A ""bug"" was already well-known in technical circles by that time, an early reference found was [by Thomas Edison](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2515435/app-development/moth-in-the-machine--debugging-the-origins-of--bug-.html)  Grace Hopper [recorded a funny instance](https://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/september/9/) of finding an actual bug that caused a computer ""bug"". She didn't find the moth that caused it, she was simply the one who wrote it in the logbook."
"I've programmed in Fortran using keypunch cards (college, mid-70's).  Each card was a line of Fortran code.  Or assembly code, or whatever.  The punch card was simply a means to get the data into the computer's memory (whatever that data might be).    Keypunch machines really were quite simple.  Typewriter like keyboard like you said and if you typed ""A"" it would punch the pattern for an ""A"" on the card in some ASCII-like code.  Each card would hold 80 (I think?) characters (think bytes).  The cards themselves could probably be thought of as a primitive form of storage.    The keypunch machines weren't connected to the computer.  Instead, after you typed your program into a ""deck of cards,"" you'd submit the cards to a computer operator.  The operator would run them through a card reader which was the actual input device on the computer.  If you made an error in a line of code, you'd retype that one card and replace it in the deck and resubmit it for another run.  All output was on 11x17 ""bluebar"" tractor-fed paper which came off a high-speed line printer that used actual ink ribbons.    Computer of course was a mainframe like you'd see in a 1940's horror flick.  Fun stuff - haven't thought of this in awhile."
That's how I found out that the maximum line number for errors in a C program is 65536. (Years ago). You get a warning that the C compiler cannot show the line number if there is a error.    It was a compiler that generated C code.
The Rust spec wasn't really done in any sense by the time that the OCaml compiler was first created. Usually compiler projects are eager to get themselves self-hosting in part because it creates a large project in the language itself that's going to need a lot of libraries and such to be created within it, thus serving as the genesis for an ecosystem. But it also has the benefit of lessening external dependencies and allowing those who later want to contribute to Rust to do so with their knowledge of Rust specifically, not needing to know OCaml.   If I remember correctly for a while rustc wasn't really written in completely natural rust, it was written in a subset that the bootstrapping compiler could understand. Even after the bootstrapping compiler was eliminated, previous versions of rustc had to be able to compile newer versions so of course there was and is some tolerance for compatibility there.  But yeah, it's not esoteric at all, I think it's an effort that can make a language much more sustainable on its own.
"Vaguely related but I always thought it was funny she's so well known for the ""bug"" story when even her name sounds like ""Grasshopper."""
Not really, a linker is part of the process to get source code to an executable, but it's not the compiler.

"The scientific community (including Ben Franklin) thought of electric current as some sort of invisible fluid. ""Positive"" objects possessed a surplus of this fluid and negative bodies didn't posses ""enough fluid"" to be ""balanced."""
I hope I'm not breaking any rules here, but r/askhistorians gets this question from time to time. [They have an FAQ section about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/science#wiki_ancients.27_views_of_static_electricity).
"Electricity has been known for a long time. Egyptians noted the similarity between electric eel shocks and lightning.  Pliny the elder (and many others) noted that these shocks could be transferred, that objects when rubbed often attracted things, that so did magnets, and that the three phenomena were connected. Thales of Miletus came up with the theory that when Amber underwent friction, it became a lodestone, and if rubbed further produced lightning proving it was a magnetic force behind lightnng. Both though in terms of ""Gods"" or ""Souls"", which in terms of philosophy might be better thought of as a ""motive force without a clear origin"".  Which is a pretty solid conclusion if you discount Thales mixed up electric fields and magnetic ones. And, you know, thought everything was water (not as stupid as it sounds.)"
There is a great [BBC documentary](https://youtu.be/Gtp51eZkwoI) on the history of electricity if you haven't seen it yet. 
"If you read Peter Winch and his ""Understanding a Primitive Society"", you could assume that they thought things like: ""We encounter the rage of spirits all the time and it's not shocking (sorry) because we know what's going on, but what on earth did people think was happening before we understood shamanism?"""
That's actually a helpful way of thinking about electricity sometimes. I've heard electricity‚Äã compared to water when explaining the difference between amps, volts, and ohms.
I don't understand why this is so highly voted up -- This doesn't answer the OP at all in terms of   a) static electricity     b) people who didn't understand electricity
That's a good read! I didn't know that amber had static properties. They had the mechanism pretty well figured out, they just didn't know what the mechanism was at all.
"Blimey, I had no idea that Electricity and Magnetism were of the same ""property"" so to speak. Pliny the elder knew far more of this phenomenon than me, and I like to think I had a reasonably sophisticated physics education in my school years.   The ancients were an incredibly intelligent people in many ways, and I often forget how clearly we stand on the shoulders of giants. "
> And, you know, thought everything was water (not as stupid as it sounds.)  Yeah. Electricity is often compared to water to make it more intuitive. There are a lot of similarities in how it functions. 
It's reasonable to mix up electric and magnetic fields, considering how linked they are.
Electric eels live in South America btw,  Africa gets electric catfish, which is what the Egyptians experienced :).
Doesn't wool generate a ton of static electricity?  How long has wool been in use?
Worth noting that the Baghdad Battery is no longer considered to have been an early battery design. The plated objects it was believed to have been used for were instead found to have been mercury fire-plated and the design of the inner compartment is almost exactly the same as scroll-holders of the time. It's believed that the slightly acidic residue left inside is due to the organic material (scroll) originally held within that would have decomposed over the years.  In other words, the Baghdad 'Battery' was actually used to hold scrolls. It wasn't a battery, it was a decorative storage vessel.
Minor tidbit that OP might find enlightening is that the word *electricity* comes from the Ancient Greek *elektron*, meaning amber. 
Care to elaborate?
If you think about it, there's no reason they should be any less smart than we are now. A mere 2000 years is nothing for evolution (especially in the lack of selection). The only difference is that we have more accumulated knowledge thanks to science and partly history and other reasonably rigorous fields. Raise a child in the jungle and you are immediately back by thousands of years. A bit scary, really.
Intuitively the comparison of fluid flow to electrical flow is one of my favorite learning analogies in physics. 
No material on its own generates static electricity. It's the rubbing of differently electronegative materials which causes charges to form.
Coat a copper wire in wax and wrap it around a ring of iron. Put a magnetic material in the middle of the ring and rotate it.  You now have an electric generator. Make a water wheel or slaves turn this generator constantly.  Now take some clay pots and some sheep intestines. Tightly wind the intestines in a coil around a copper rod and place them in the pot. Fill the pot with fruit juice. Place another copper rod on the outside edge of the roil of intestines. You now have an electrolytic capacitor.   Same setup as the pot, but without sheep skin coil and the two rods need to be made of different materials and you have a battery.  Build enough capacitors to store enough energy to cause electrical arching.  Use this device to execute your political rivals by putting one side of the circuit on the front and back of the chest directly over the heart.  You now have the power to kill your rivals on touch, granted by the gods.  If you just want impressive static electricity, take a wool cloth strip and rub it over a piece of glass or a really clear piece of quartz. Make a belt of the wool and run it around the glass to make it more automatic. The glass end of the wool will build up a charge. If you put a metal dome over this end with a pointed piece hanging down from the dome to just above the wool you get a static generator capable of some pretty sparks.
Think of ohms like the size of the pipes, low resistance is akin to a large pipe. A small pipe wouldn't allow a lot of water to flow, high resistance.  Think of volts like a pump, or water pressure. It pushes the water thru the pipe like voltage pushes electricity thru a wire.  And think of amps like the amount of water that goes thru a pipe.  So when you want a lot of water (amps) you need a large pipe (low resistance, or minimum ohms) and a nice big pump (voltage).   The old saying (ohms law) is it takes 1 volt to push 1 amp thru 1 ohm. It's not a great saying because it's easy to get volts and amps turned around. 
That's the cool thing. If you had a time machine, you could take a baby from the Middle Ages and raise them in a modern society and few if anybody would know the difference and vice versa. I think it would be especially interesting to see what someone like Da Vinci would be able to do with modern knowledge 
We were always taught in class that electricity is like water in the sense that both will take the path of least resistance.
Indeed, it does not generate it, but it takes no more than a the removal of a wool garment while having a head of hair to witness substantial amounts of static electric discharge.  Is there something modern about those conditions?
"To add to the analogy, resistors can be seen as a filter obstructing water flow and a battery is a turbine/pump. The battery/pump analogy was especially helpful during my undergrad because I had wrongly assumed that a battery was adding electrons to the system when in reality it was ""pulling"" electron from one end and ""pushing"" them in the other. "
While the brain may be the same, the immune system is not so please be careful if you find a time machine.
Is there a capacitor analogy? Maybe a water filter/jug  (like a Brita?)
No, you're just grasping at straws. They used wool very often back then, and you guys are trying to simplify something that isn't that simple. Ancients must have encountered static electricity at least 20% as much as we do now. That would still be enough that everyone encountered it somewhat regularly (once a year or more).  I believe that people here are trying to act like they know more than they do. Of course ancients encountered static electricity. They must have at least discussed it a little bit. I'd love some actual sources.  Cleanliness wasn't as much of a thing back then, but surely wool on even greasy hair would produce static. 
"Everyone saying tank that releases water all at once are missing the point of a capacitor.  A capacitor ""resists"" changes in voltage using stored charge.    So in our water analogy, a capacitor would be analogous to a tank that tries to stabilize the pressure in the water.  If the pressure drops, the capacitor adds water to the plumbing to fight the pressure drop.  If the pressure rises, the capacitor sucks some water in to try to drop the pressure.  So a capacitor is most like water pressure regulator I guess?  A fancy one that tries to minimize transient pressure changes."
A capacitor is like those big tip buckets at water parks. It fills and fills and fills and then when its full it dumps the water and goes right back to filling.
The thing you are thinking of is an elastic membrane that get stretched by the pressure. Even the equation for amount of energy stored in both is the same. 
"Semiotician W. C. Watt, after much research, concluded that the alphabet ordering descended from an early organization that grouped the letters by their sounds, which might have been used as a teaching tool for language (although that original organization/artifact is now lost). He called it the ""[Ras Shamra Matrix](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/semi.1989.74.issue-1-2/semi.1989.74.1-2.61/semi.1989.74.1-2.61.xml).""  Apparently he hadn't really even considered the question until a student asked him, and he realized he didn't know. However, he thought about the alphabet (A-B-C-D), realized that earlier organizations, like in Hebrew, had Bet-Gimel-Daleth (B-G-D), which are phonetically related, and so it might not be arbitrary. This sent him off on a research quest trying to figure it out."
Short answer: maybe, maybe not. No one is sure.   Longer answer: The alphabet we use today is something that evolved over ~3,000 years, through 4 iterations minimum:   Phoenician ‚áí Greek ‚áí Latin ‚áí modern languages with letters like J, W, and √ü, as well as diacriticals like √• and diphthongs like ≈ì.   As a result, there‚Äôs no one answer for where the order for a given modern language comes from. The alphabet for English is different from that of French, or Swedish, or Polish. Consider the Hungarian alphabet, which looks like this:  a, √°, b, c, cs, d, dz, dzs, e, √©, f, g, gy, h, i, √≠, j, k, l, ly, m, n, ny, o, √≥, √∂, ≈ë, p, q, r, s, sz, t, ty, u, √∫, √º, √ª, v, w, x, y, z, zs  Now, we can look at that and see that the basic order of the Latin alphabet remains. The additions are just stuck in after the related letters whose sounds they modify. As with English, we have the Latin alphabetical order, plus the later medieval insertions of j and w. The insertions are obvious and easy, because they simply follow the letters they were invented to modify/clarify.   But for the Latin order, it‚Äôs trickier. Latin is a blend of Etruscan and Greek, and they adopted neither wholesale. For example, Etruscan had 3 letters for what we would think of a ‚Äòk‚Äô sounds today: C, Q, and K (probably ‚Äòkay‚Äô, ‚Äòqoo‚Äô and ‚Äòka‚Äô but this is a guess since Etruscan remains untranslated). G was a lesser-used sound in Etruscan, but /k/ was very important, so they invented C from G, swapped kappa and gamma in the order, then inserted the ‚Äòother‚Äô k sound further down the line from œò or qoppa , a pre-standardized Greek letter used in some cities.   Long story short, there‚Äôs some interesting linguistics research that suggests certain groupings of letters were created intentionally by different groups at different times, and then just kept out of habit by adopters.   So for example, the Beth Gimel Dat sequencing mentioned in a number of other posts was adopted directly into Greek as Beta Gamma Delta, but then the Gamma was replaced with C in Latin.   EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!
[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi) alphabets are ordered in two different categories: all vowels preceeds the order followed by all the consonants. The ordering is very clever and when you speak in the order, you can notice the subtle movements of the tongue and muscles in a particular way.   For example, the first four consonants are 'Ka', 'Kha', 'Ga', 'Gha'. When you pronounce it you see your tongue rises with every alphabet.  [See this chart](http://hindilearner.com/images/alphabets/consonant.png) for all the consonants in order.  Edit: A word.
> almost all modern alphabets descended from the alphabet first used extensively by ancient Phoenicians  What's really interesting is that true alphabet, in which isolated vowels and consonants each have their own separate letters, rather than being grouped into symbols representing combinations of sounds or entire words, was essentially invented only *once* in history; all other alphabets descended from that one.
Is that why alphabet and English study at a young age is called phonetics? 
The Phoenician alphabet is descended from the earlier Ugaritic alphabet, which actually had [two letter orders in use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic_alphabet#Abecedaries) at the time, the Northern and Southern Semitic orders. The Phoenician alphabet (and thus its descendants) just happened to use the Northern Semitic order, so it's really just an accident of history. The Southern Semitic order is still reflected today in the Ethiopian Ge'ez script. Interestingly, Ethiopians often refer to the Ge'ez as halehame (after the first four letters of the Southern Semitic order) just as the words alphabet, abecedary, abugida, abjad etc refer to the first two to four letters of the Northern Semitic order and its descendants.

Yes, but that is a modern order.  Before that, the order was a poem which paraphrased the heart sutra and used each letter once and only once.  I ro ha ni o he do, chi ri nu ro wo...(tho the blossoms are colorful, all are doomed to scatter...)
"Abjad is the word for ""proto-alphabet"" you're looking for. Abjads only have unique glyphs for consonants and vowels are either not written or can be represented by diacritics in certain abjads. The original Phoenician alphabet was an abjad as well but the greeks gave it vowels and created the first ""alphabet"" as such."
"King Sejong the Great created the Korean alphabet known as Hangul in 1443, which seems to be somewhat related to ""Square Tibetan"" (Ledyard's theory), which has lineage from Brahmi, Aramaic and Phoenician. [Wikipedia article on the origins of the Hangul writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_Hangul#Ledyard's_theory_of_consonant_letters)"
Im not actually convinced that the root of those isn't the same at some point. 
Given that the Southern Semitic order has been retained very conservatively in Ge'ez after millennia, and Indic order has been retained in Japanese kana centuries after exposure to Brahmic scripts, I'd say letter order just tends to be one of the most conservatively preserved elements of whichever alphabet a culture begins using extensively, more so than letter forms. Cultural dominance probably played much more of a role than any innate property; the Phoenicians happened to use Northern Semitic order, so the Greeks happened to keep more or less the same order when they adopted the Phoenician alphabet.  The same question is often asked about [writing directionality](https://imgur.com/a/GUJ4s) among other things, but as this chart shows, current dominance of a linguistic property doesn't necessarily mean that dominance was inevitable (or even foreseeable).
The Elves' looked down on the Istari for the most part. They looked down on everyone who wasn't Elven. (according to Tolkien)
How would Hebrew fit into that? The written words have no vowels but are denoted with vowel markings. Those vowels aren‚Äôt used in the Torah at all. You know the right pronunciation of the word, or you don‚Äôt. That was a trip to learn as a kid alongside the English alphabet. Funny enough, the first letters are aleph then bet. 
It's not the same root though-- in Latin, Pho and Phoe are pronounced differently
Funny enough? They're related. And it's an abjad just like the others in the region - Aramaic, Arabic, etc.
Yes! In fact in Latin the Greek Œ¶ŒøŒπŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ∑ sounds closer to ‚ÄúPunic.‚Äù Phoenicia is how Latin speakers transliterated the Greek, but in English, the Greek would be pronounced something like p‚Äôuinikƒì. (P‚Äô with a puff of air, like British ‚Äúpot‚Äù)  Œ¶œâŒΩŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ  (Latin phoneticus) would be pronounced p‚Äô≈çnƒìtikos, where ≈ç is actually a short o but pronounced longer than an English speaker would feel comfortable‚Äîmaybe p‚Äôahhhnehhtikos.  That‚Äôs why the Roman wars against the Phoenician colony of Carthage are called the Punic Wars.

"We can calculate things like gravity and energy density of the universe base on how the galaxies behave on a cosmic scale.  We can also calculate how much stuff is out there by direct observation.  When we look at the cosmos and look at how the galaxies behave, there is not enough material to generate the gravity (even when accounting for all the gas and dust that may obscuring it).  So there's some matter that doesn't emit light but still generates that gravity we see.  We call it dark matter, because that's what it is: dark.  There's also an expansion to the universe that suggests that the energy density is not what we can directly measure.  There's a bunch of stuff out there causing the universe to expand at an accelerated rate.  We call it dark energy, because, hey, we have dark matter already--why not call it ""Dark Energy""; that way it sounds cool.  So there's like 5 times as much matter as what we can see, and like 3 times as much energy density as what can be explained by that matter.  So that's where the percentages come from: just add up all the stuff we know about that makes up the universe even if we don't yet know what that stuff is."
In layman's terms: dark matter is *something that generates gravity that we can't see*.  We can calculate the gravitational forces that impact everything we can see - stars, planets, black holes, dust, etc. We can calculate how much gravity the things we observe is generating. The problem is, they don't add up. There's way more gravity affecting everything than what is being generated. All of that unexplained gravity is just generalized as dark matter until a better explanation comes along. Same kinda deal with dark energy.
"For dark matter and ordinary matter, we basically measure the *total* matter first (since it all gravitates the same), then differentiate between the two using a second effect.   The total matter (23%+5%=28%) is roughly given by the ratio of heights of the first and third peaks in the [Cosmic Microwave Background angular powerspectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#/media/File:PowerSpectrumExt.svg) because the third peak mostly evolved (by gravity) when the matter content of the universe was negligible, and the first peak mostly evolved when the universe was matter dominated. So the third peak is kind of a calibrator letting the first peak tells you how much matter there is.  To differentiate just the ""ordinary matter"" part, you can get that from the CMB too, but an even cooler way is by measuring how much of various atomic elements there are in the universe in little pockets that appear to have been pristinely left from the Big Bang. In these pockets, you see that something like 24% of the atoms are Helium-4. The amount of Helium-4 formed by the Big Bang depends really sensitively on how much ordinary matter there was, i.e. the ordinary atoms that are the building blocks of Helium. Run the math and that 24% number tells you about 5% of the universe is normal matter. Then 28%-5% and you get the part which is ""missing"", i.e. dark matter.   As for dark energy, well we've just measured how much matter there is (I actually cheated a bit above, those things tells you the total amount of matter, not the percentage relative to everything), so we can calculate how much all that matter gravitating in on itself should slow the expansion of the universe. Then you go and measure the expansion and find, lo-and-behold, not only is the expansion not slowing, its accelerating! Using supernovae as beacons to precisely measure the acceleration rate, you work out how much dark energy there is, giving you that 72% number.  There's probably like 10 other ways to measure these things than what I just described, cosmologists are constantly looking for new ways to do so and comparing the answers against each other, in hope to find a crack in the model pointing to some new things we don't understand!  "
Could these phenomena just be (but probably not likely) an incomplete understanding of how physical laws, which are already discovered, work?
>Same kinda deal with dark energy.  Dark energy is whatever is doing the work to accelerate the expansion of spacetime. Why We knew that the universe is expanding, bit it seems like the RATE at which it's expanding was itself increasing. What's causing this acceleration? There has to be some energy that we can't see. But it's got nothing to do with the gravity or the warping of space time.  There was some talk that the observations which demonstrated an accelerating exclamation couldn't be replicated with better equipment, and may have even been an error on a single study. But I feel I would have read much more about that since then if it were credible.
"It's possible that dark matter and dark energy don't actually exist, but this would lead to a more dramatic upheaval than you might be thinking. A absolute disproving of dark matter would likely lead us to throw out most of modern astrophysics. As you might imagine, this would also be pretty hard to accomplish, what with it not reacting to light and all.  These kinds of additions have been revoked before, though. Aether was introduced into early scientific models to give light a material to travel through (much like sound and other waves need). The famous ""Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment"" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)) showed this couldn't be the case, and so science moved on to realize that Light was made of Photons and therefore didn't need a material to transmit.  Other examples exist, but for now we know that if our observations are correct and that there our current model is accurate to some respect, then some matter exists that we can't see."
So should we think of dark matter like how we assumed there was the luminiferous aether up until the Michelson-Morley experiment & special relativity?
[Tired light](http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/tiredlit.htm) has been debunked. It does not work. The universe would look different if it was real. 
Yes - that's how we know it's there, because it has gravity. The first way it was directly detected was in the rotation speeds of galaxies, which are too fast for the amount of matter we can see. But gravitational lensing, which is the bending of light by massive objects, is something we can see directly and tells us quite precisely how much mass in in a certain area. Spoiler - lots more than we can see. Even tenuous, cold hydrogen gas interacts with light, and that wouldn't explain a lot of other astrophysical phenomena, so this has to be something else.
Except that's only from hindsight. Light traveling through a vacuum was an observed effect of the aether.    If we find out GR is just wrong and there's actually no dark matter out there, our evidence of the gravity we observed it having is as bad in hindsight as the observation of a wave traveling through a vacuum was for the aether. 
No, the understanding we have of the ways matter can exist in galaxies means this doesn't really work. When matter (we're mainly talking hydrogen and helium here) get beyond a certain density, stars start to form. Stars emit light, and we understand the masses and densities of stars very well. Matter can of course end up in black holes and a few other dense, exotic objects like neutron stars that we can't directly see, but by and large we understand pretty well how many of these could be formed for every number of visible stars we see.  Our working model of the universe suggests quite strongly that galaxies form inside big clumps of invisible dark matter - that it's the gravity of the dark matter clumps that helps the gas to fall in and eventually get dense enough to form stars and galaxies. These dark matter halos we can measure with gravitational lensing and other ways. Despite the totally unknown nature of dark matter, it's really hard to explain all the other stuff we see without it.
The difference is that dark matter is a placeholder for an effect describing our observation. The name dark matter doesn‚Äôt necessarily assume it‚Äôs matter or any other effect. Luminiferous aether did assume the cause of an effect, it assumed the solution to medium-less wave propagation. Our observations are accurate in terms of raw data, the question of why our observations differ from theory are all summed up together in the name dark matter. Dark matter is merely the name for the phenomena because it‚Äôs the simplest and most obvious explanation, but that explanation is not presumed.   Edit: Luminiferous Arthur is a respected scientist and you should all be ashamed! ^/s
"Canadian checking in here.   **This comment has been updated with better info and links for the sake of clarity, see below for new info**  Original Comment:  >As far as I can tell from my research into how this affects Canada, there is only one undersea fiber cable linking Canada's internet to the rest of the world that doesnt go through the US first. That link goes to Greenland and reportedly has had frequent issues since it was built due to poor construction. Aside from this Greenland link, all other wired Canadian internet traffic goes through the US first before going to the rest of the world. The US could effectively cut Canada off from the internet if it wanted to.  >However, there is a proposal to built a new, modern fiber link through the Canadian arctic that would link London, UK with Tokyo, Japan. This would significantly reduce latency between Western Europe and East Asia while also bypassing the mainland US. It would also provide gigabit internet access to thousands of remote Inuit communities in the Canadian Arctic, which could have life changing effects on their economies.  **UPDATES**  Thanks to /u/RcNorth and /u/markszpak for highlighting [this more detailed map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/submarine-cable/gtt-atlantic) than the ones I based the previous version of this comment on. This more detailed map clearly shows that there are 3 fiber links from Halifax to the UK in addition to a fiber link up to Greenland that I mentioned previously.  However as described by /u/SoontobeSam:  >As a former network operations technician for a Canadian ISP, this is correct, telegreenland's cable is the only subsea fiber I am aware of that does not enter the US before Canada, our other main access routes are in Toronto and Vancouver, but both connect to the US to access international networks. I can also confirm that their network uptime is mostly ok, but when they do have issues it takes forever to get any progress and dealing with ongoing non outage issues is difficult, also Newfies and Scots have a serious language barrier even though they're both speaking ""English"".  So while my initial remarks regarding the US basically being the gatekeeper for Canada's access to the wider Internet may be more or less correct, I was incorrect in saying that the Greenland fiber link is the ONLY fiber link Canada has to the rest of the world. While the Toronto, Halifax, and Vancouver links /u/SoontobeSam mentioned appear to all go through the US in some way first which technically restricts Canada's direct access through those links.  **Arctic Fiber**  By popular request here is [the link to the site](http://qexpressnet.com/system/) for the fiber link through the Canadian Arctic that I mentioned previously. The project was formerly known as Arctic Fiber, but has been re-branded as the Quintillion Cable System after the name of the company task with installing the cable. Yes, you read that right, this project has gotten the green light since I last checked up on it (I didn't have time to check on my way to work when I commented originally). They just completed Phase 1 which covers Alaska, and will be starting the Phase 2 to expand through Asia to Tokyo soon. Quintillion has also built a terrestrial link through Alaska and down to the mainland US in order to provide connection to existing connection hubs on the west coast.  *UPDATE 2: Just have to highlight these two awesome users comments:*  User /u/KrazyTrumpeter05 posted [an awesome comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7ez85x/with_all_this_fuss_about_net_neutrality_exactly/dq9ir7v/) with more info about Canadian Fiber connections, and also linked to [this 293 report](http://subtelforum.com/products/submarine-cable-almanac/) they claim to have played a major role in writing about Internet Fiber connections around the world. Thanks for the fascinating info!  User /u/Fochang1 posted [this fascinating comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7ez85x/with_all_this_fuss_about_net_neutrality_exactly/dq9ic13/) about how South American/Caribbean nations have a similar issue with the US acting as their Internet gatekeepers. They linked to [this insane Internet Exchange Point](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAP_of_the_Americas) in Miami that routes most of South/Central America's internet traffic. Thanks for sharing this incredible perspective that Canadians like myself would otherwise be oblivious to!  **Some thoughts on the impact of Arctic Fiber** The fact that this project is actually being built is incredible, because it will mean a huge boost in connection for remote arctic communities that open up massive new economic and information exchange opportunities to these historically very isolated regions. I can't wait to see what the Inuit peoples of Canada's arctic will do with this new link to the outside world. Reconciliation between Canada's indigenous and non-indigenous peoples has become a major focus for Canada in recent years, with the Canadian government [set to fully implement into law](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-backs-undrip-bill-1.4412037) a 2007 [UN declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html). There is a long way to go for reconciliation, and it has been a very rocky road so far, but I hope that this new Fiber link will open up new ways for a large portion of Canada's indigenous population to showcase their own culture to the world and make new economic opportunities for their communities in the digital marketplace.  If you for some reason read through everything to this point, thanks for reading :)"
I would like to know what the ISPs are thinking of Elon Musk's (and others) notion of covering the planet with satellite based service, and how would they compete with that? It seems inevitable that this is in some form the future of internet. And then as an aside, will the competition be companies throwing up MORE satellites? 
"See [this](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Internet_access_in_households_by_degree_of_urbanisation,_2016_\(%25_of_all_households\)_YB17.png) and [this](http://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/what-percentage-of-american-homes-have-a-computer/) and [this](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/19/census-computer-ownership-internet-connection-varies-widely-across-u-s/). Also check [here](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/) and [here](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/europe-population/). You can see the percentages of households with a computer and internet access is in both around 70% - 80%, just pick 75% for ease of calculation, US having 330mln citizens and EU having 750 mln, that means that there are at least, respectively, 250 mln US citizens with access to internet, and in EU 560 mln. To achieve the best internet experience the datacenters for all big companies that everyone uses are spread across the world, with the concentration of datacenters being proportional to the traffic. Knowing EU has twice as many internet users as US, logically there should be, and probably are - more datacenters in EU than in US. This means that impact on EU will be low but it can lead to other unforeseen consequences outside of ""just the internet"". Same counts for other regions like Canada, South America, Asia, Australia (they have shit internet anyways) and Africa. Biggest impact (in order) I expect this to have is: Canada, EU, South America, Asia, Australia, Africa. Look for example how IBMs datacenters are [spread around the world](https://prnewswire2-a.akamaihd.net/p/1893751/sp/189375100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_ny63t7c4/def_height/2700/def_width/2700/version/100011/type/1?.jpg). Other big companies probably have the same spread. This would confirm which regions of the world would be fucked most by US net neutrality laws being repealed. Also check out [Azure's datacenters spread](http://africatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/microsoft-804x452.jpg) and [Google's datacenters spread](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2345/2404505335_9f06ed86ac_o.jpg).   [Here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/complete-white-paper-c11-481360.html) you can see US will account for ""only"" (still a big chunk though) 30% of the worlds internet traffic in 2021 (maybe that will change with the laws repealed though). But there's still the 70% of traffic outside US.  [Worldwide](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS) 45% of the population has internet access one way or another (for 7 bln people that makes 3.15 bln). Of those 3.15 bln users, US counts for 250 mln, or just shy of 8% of the worlds internet population. This means other internet traffic is generated by 92% of the rest population in the world.  So, as of now the 8% of internet worldwide internet population located in US generates 30% of the internet traffic while 92% of the world generates 70% of the traffic.. well good for Americans I guess, that will make the impact a bit heavier on the rest of the world?..  As for other unforeseen consequences, think of intercontinental shipping, they need to send data between them to coordinate stuff, slow it down and it could mean your shipping container gets delayed by a week? Maybe this is an exaggeration but who knows.."
I‚Äôm unclear if this FCC ‚Äúruling‚Äù will only allow them to throttle connections to their subscribers down stream. This post infers that services hosted in US data centres can have their UP connections throttled no matter where the user is. Nothing surprises me about what is happening there, but this would really be pushing it. If US data centres are affected like this, Canadian & Mexican data centres are about to see a lot of new business.  Edit: Make more readable.
That would be spectacular! Would also help me game with my buddies from the uk a little easier c:

except of course that satellites have some inherent, unavoidable technical disadvantages, high latency being the biggest.  Satellites will not do for gaming, or real-time audio/video.  For general communication sure, but there are certain things that terrestrial fibre and cellular networks  cannot be beaten at.
I hate to be the guy to tell you this but.... If this Net Neutrality stuff is repealed, and valve doesn't pay up then all steam server access will be significantly slowed.  Bottom line is internet is a network of sub-networks. These sub-networks are owned by ISPs and they make deals to allow one another to route packets through their cables. If this net neutrality stuff is repealed, although the rest of the routing around the world wouldn't be effected much, any routing via the US, or from the US will be subject to the bandwidth limits set by their ISPs.  Think of it as a pipe it doesn't matter how large the pipes are, if there is one section of the pipe that is really small then that is the limiter of the throughput of the entire system. 
Low Earth Orbit (which SpaceX's plan involves) latency is actually pretty low. We are talking about the ballpark of [25ms](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-will-launch-thousands-of-broadband-satellites/), not the traditional hundreds of milliseconds that geosynchronous orbits have.  The only issue is you need more satellites to cover the area and since they move around relative to ground, more advanced antennas that can track them.
> valve doesn't pay up then all steam server access will be significantly slowed.  I would be shocked if they didn't already have servers outside the US, and if they don't, it wouldn't take much to do so. 
‚ÄúBottom line is internet is a network of sub-networks.‚Äù  Did you mean ‚Äúa series of tubes‚Äù?
It's unbelievable. The most important communication tool in all of human history is about to be crippled so that a tiny group of people can afford new yachts.
That is an extremely optimistic estimate. You'll have 14 ms just from the speed of light if bouncing from one satellite. That means they are leaving only 10 ms for all the terrestrial transmission, routing, etc.. Given the SNR is not going to be great, you can't expect much in terms of bandwidth either.
Fun Fact! Many huge internet companies have massive datacenters in remote northern Sweden and Finland because half of the year it costs nothing to cool the place down, which is the main expenses associated with a datacenter, I bet it only takes a few years for the cost of refrigeration to outstrip the cost of servers in centers closer to the equator.
Where did you get the 14ms figures? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_satellite_constellation), the satellites are going to be 1110 to 1325 km high. If you are directly below it (just to simply the trigonometry math), 1 325 000 m / 299 792 458 (m/s) = 4.4 ms, one way. Roundtrip would be 8.8 ms.
We should liquid cool the datacenters and route all the water to jacuzzis and spas and heated pools. Win win.
You're thinking too small, have the heat power stills, water goes in, absolut vodka comes out. Once the vodka is there the hot tubs will follow. (saunas if you wanted to be authentic) 
Well, the whole point of this endeavor is to send enough satellites up that you won't be communicating with satellites on the horizon. Otherwise this obviously won't work.  There's a reason why it's SpaceX that's doing this. They currently have a monopoly on low-cost reusable rockets, and this reusability opens up new venues that weren't previously available. They only reuse first stage right now, but their next rocket, BFR, is going to be designed with full reusability which would make the marginal cost to only be the satellite (which they are claiming is going to cheap), fuel (methane), and maintenance.  When SpaceX first started to do reusability rockets it may have seemed pointless, as space launches were infrequent, but what that did was opening up completely new uses for satellites that would otherwise have been too costly to be practical.
"As several people have pointed out, the question is not [""what is Jupiter's structure""](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duunoak/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=askscience) or [""When did scientists realize that Jupiter had an atmosphere""](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duupzwm/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=askscience), it's ""when did scientists realize it had no solid ground?"".  It's about the *history* of knowledge of the interior composition.  Since, [recent spacecraft results](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duuorz9/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=askscience) suggest it may gradually transition into something like a small solid core, let's interpret the question as, ""When did we first realize that Jupiter wasn't a rocky planet""?  To solve this problem, you need to calculate the mass of Jupiter and its size, so you can find its *density*.  The mass of Jupiter can be calculated using Newtonian orbital mechanics, provided you know the orbital period and orbital diameter of its moons.  Period is easy, but a major historical problem in solar system studies was finding the relative scale of *everything*: it's easy to measure angles and relative sizes with a telescope, but we need the actual length dimensions.  You need a baseline distance to start with, such as the distance from the Earth to the Sun: this was worked out [in the late 1600s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#History): from that, the size of Jupiter, the size of its moons' orbits, and thus its mass and density could be found.  So even before 1700, astronomers realized that Jupiter was 300 times the mass of Earth, but with a density much less than that of rock.  Since the density known today is about 1.4 times that of water, I suppose that without knowledge of high-pressure physics they couldn't rule out a liquid water or ice planet, but scientists have known for over 300 years that Jupiter is definitely not a rocky world.  H. G. Wells was a fantastic writer, but he maybe wasn't so meticulous about doing his library research.  The story is laid out by Reta Beebe in [*Jupiter: The Giant Planet*](https://www.amazon.com/JUPITER-Smithsonian-Library-Solar-System/dp/1560986859) (1997).   "
Giovanni Cassini observed the different latitudes of Jupiter rotated at different rates in 1690. He concluded the planet could not be solid - ie was liquid or gas because a solid planet would not allow differential rotation
One thing to add is [differential rotation](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Differential+Rotation), which basically means that different parts/regions of a celestial body rotate at different speeds. So a solid planet would rotate in alignment across all latitudes while gas objects (sun, Jupiter) typically have equatorial regions that rotate more quickly than areas closer to the poles.  > Examples of differential rotation are found throughout astronomy. In stars (including the Sun) and the gas giant planets, the equatorial regions rotate faster than regions closer to the poles, meaning that equatorial sunspots and cloud formations will move across the face of the object faster than their polar cousins.  In 1690, Giovanni Cassini was the first to discover the differential rotation within Jupiter's atmosphere. What I don't know though is whether that was exactly translated to: 'Jupiter must be a gaseous or gaseous-like body.'
>  H. G. Wells was a fantastic writer, but he maybe wasn't so meticulous about doing his library research.  A minor point, but Jupiter isn't mentioned in the book. It's the narration in the 1953 movie which goes as follows:  > Their nearest world was Jupiter, with giant cliffs of lava and ice, with hydrogen flaming at the tops. The atmosphere is awful. Thousands of pounds to the square inch.
How did he know they weren't clouds above a solid surface?
Pretty bonkers that someone almost 300 years ago can observe something 365 million miles away (600mm at its furthest) and have a correct theory on why it is the way it is.
So it could be that Jupiter is earth sized but the rest is just gas? 
For a bit of background, you can trivially calculate (to a high degree of  accuracy) the mass of anything that has an object orbiting it. That's the main way of calculating the mass of things in space.  That's why the error margins for the masses of asteroids and comets are so much higher than for planets, with planets we nearly directly measure the mass, with those other objects we look at the size, make a huge guess about what it may be made of from how shiny it is and where it is, and then go from there.
The book is actually quite scientifically accurate, for the most part. It talks about spectroscopy and newly-discovered elements such as Argon to name a couple of things. H.G. Wells seems to have had a good understanding of the scientific knowledge at the time.
Jupiter is not even remotely close to being the nearest planet to mars.  Earth is 10 times closer to mars than Jupiter is.
It absolutely blows my mind to think of some of the things we have accomplished.  Even more mind blowing to realize a ton of those aren't even recent technologies.  The first rocket that took humans to the moon and back had a simpler computer than your phone (much simpler, in fact).
I mean there are Hot Jupiters that get too close to their star and the gases all burn away to reveal a rocky core, aren't there? Or is that all just theory still?
"Not ""the rest."" There may or may not be a huge rocky core much larger than earth, but due to the pressure from its size most of the rest is a liquid."
I assume the pressure would crush a probe before it reached the core, or the gases would just block the signal.
I love that book so much. He thought of everything. Gravity on mars is lighter, so martians don't need stiff skeletons like we do, they're octopus-like. They're too floppy to walk in earth's gravity, so they blasted entire factories out of a giant gun pointed at earth, so within a few days of the factories crashing to the surface, they could build a small army of mechanical walkers to compensate for the gravity. H. G. Wells even invented the idea of the heat ray, and it doesn't make any fancy lights or sounds like Star Trek phasers, it just makes the air in its line of sight hot enough to combust whatever it's pointed at. And the accounts he gives of trying to fight off the aliens with 19th century weapons are awesome. War of the Worlds is some good-ass hard scifi.
Wells‚Äò Martians were actually unique at the time for being non-humanoid (which makes them a lot more plausible), but he was criticized a lot because back then most people assumed intelligent aliens had to look humanoid because they thought that‚Äòs the only shape possible for an intelligent creature. 
The whole thing sounds like it was written about Venus, and then at the last minute they swapped the name for some reason. Except even then the closest planet bit doesn't make sense, unless maybe Mars is closer to Venus than Earth during certain orbital alignments?
Wouldn't it technically have a surface if it has a solid core?
That's just speculation on how super terrestrial planets are being found really close to their stars.
I also enjoyed the fact that Wells didn't make the Martians insanely invincible since old, 19th century artillery could take down a walker although it took a large amount of guns to do so. 
I was curious what that distance would be for a certain orbital alignment.   Mars  Venus  Sun  Earth  Venus is 108m kilometers from the sun, Earth is 150m km from the sun, Mars is 228m km from the sun.   So when Venus is on opposite side of the sun from earth, it's 258m km away from earth. If mars is on the same side of the sun as Venus then it would be 120m km away from Venus which would make Venus the closest planet to Mars.  
Inclination not included, no.  Even if Mars and Jupiter were in perfect alignment with the sun, and the Earth was exactly opposite 180 degrees their position on the opposing side of the sun, Earth would  still be around 32% closer to Mars than Jupiter.    Space is big. Really big. You just won‚Äôt believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it‚Äôs a long way down the road to the chemist‚Äôs, but that‚Äôs just peanuts to space.
"We don't actually know that the core of Jupiter is. As you go down deeper, atmospheric hydrogen becomes metallic hydrogen. And it continues to get hotter. Jupiter should have a composition similar to the nebula that formed our solar system, and heavier elements should be fairly rare, but they'll be there.  The thing is this. We don't know if the core of Jupiter is a heavy metal lump under all this massive pressure or if it's just a mix of all the elements and is undergoing convection, in which case the the heavy elements will be very dispersed.  Even if all the heavy elements are concentrated in a core, they are extremely hot, and the boundary between super dense metallic hydrogen and the core wouldn't be so defined you could say it had a surface.  Also, on an interesting side note, it's been theorized that the pressure would cause carbon in the atmosphere to crystallize and form a diamond ""rain"", where denser diamond would slowly move down to the core."

But can it run Crysis?
2.4x that of Earth. Gas is still matter and still had gravitational pull.
I think this is kind of a weak point.  If mars is so sterile that you could literally eat off the surface, there‚Äôs no reason to think that the second they showed up here, as completely sterile life forms, that just the most basic airborne molecules housing billions of years of viruses/bacteria fully adapted to infecting and spreading into living organisms to further mutate and propagate itself, wouldn‚Äôt quickly and severely harm the Aliens.  On the contrary, while some view it as a cop out, I would opt that it‚Äôs probably the most scientifically likely thing to happen if the story were true.
And also protected you from radiation and pressure.  In a nutshell, if you're protected from everything about the environment you're in then that environment won't kill you.

It is pretty much impossible to melt wood. The reason is that as you start heading the wood up, its constituent building blocks tend to break up before the material can melt. This behavior is due to the fact that wood is made up of a strong network of cellulose fibers connected by a lignin mesh. You would need to add *a lot* of energy to allow the cellulose fibers to be able to easily slide past each other in order to create a molten state. On the other hand, there are plenty of other reactions that can kick in first as you transfer heat to the material.  If you have oxygen around you one key reactions is of course combustion. But even in the absence of oxygen there are plenty of reactions that will break up the material at the molecular level. The umbrella term for all of these messy reactions driven by heat is called [pyrolysis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis)  **Reference:**  1. Schroeter, J., et al. Melting Cellulose. *Cellulose* 2005: 12, pg 159-165. ([link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10570-004-0344-3))
No, just as when you boil lemonade, you don't get lemonade gas but rather steam and lemon caramel. Phase transitions don't happen to all constituents simultaneously, and plenty of other chemical reaction occur along the way.
"No. In fact the process you are describing is exactly [how you make charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal).  ""Charcoal is usually produced by slow [pyrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis) ‚Äî the heating of wood or other substances in the absence of oxygen""  Water and other volatile organic compounds (such as methanol) are basically boiled off and what remains is a large lump of carbon- a.k.a charcoal.  Can you melt carbon? No- not at [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon#Characteristics)  ""At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ¬± 0.2 MPa and 4,600 ¬± 300 K (~4,330 ¬∞C or 7,820 ¬∞F), so it sublimes at about 3,900 K."""
You can heat the wood enough to soften the lignin and then bend it.  This is maybe the closest you can get to anything similar to melting it.  Once it cools, it will stay as it was bent, this is how acoustic guitar makers bend the sides of a guitar.  It's a common technique in making furniture as well. 
Isn't heating wood in a low-oxygen environment how charcoal is made?
"I'd like to add that pyrolysis (""burning"" substances without oxygen) is a pretty well understood phenomenon.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis"
My capstone project in college was designing a pyrolysis reactor to make carbon from sawdust.
And methanol, aka wood alcohol. I believe the technique is called dry distillation. The methanol and other vapors escape the wood and what‚Äôs left behind is charcoal.   [Dry distillation of wood](https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-BPP2-0015-0004/c/Lewandowski_GB.pdf)
I used to make charcoal the traditional way in a big iron kiln. It is made by what is called a ‚Äòcontrolled burn‚Äô. You let it (the wood) burn but starve it of oxygen so it just smoulders. 72hrs later you have some high quality bbq charcoal!
Technically it's what goes on inside every solid-fuel flame.   Gas isn't dense enough to create the kind of light you see from a campfire.  What's happening is that the visible flame is the area where all the oxygen is gone.   The heat pyrolyses the fuel,  vaporizing it. But with no oxygen it can't burn. The fuel floats up through the flame to the edge where there is oxygen available.   Once at the edge it can burn,  and does so, releasing heat.  This heats up the vapor still in the flame making it hot enough to visibly glow in the visible spectrum.   Hence, visible flames.  Ie campfire flames aren't showing you combustion.   They're areas of glowing fuel vapor stuck in an oxygen-less bubble.  When they reach the edge of that bubble they burn, vaporizing and heating more fuel, and eating up oxygen so the inner bubble stays O2-free.  The combustion is on the tips of the flames. The flames are just fuel lines. 
"And, more importantly ""wood gas"" - mainly CO which was used in Germany during WW II in cars with a so called ""Holzvergaser"" as other fuel was ~~sacred~~ scarce.  Edit: no such thing as holy fuel"
Wood gas is still a major source of fuel for North Korea. A lot of the military vehicles run on it as fuel in the isolated country is scarce. Since there is no religion allowed in DPRK, fuel is not sacred.
flames are electrons crying photons because angry exothermic reactions won't let them relax 
It was a lot of putting together all of the information I'd learned throughout my undergraduate education.  It included a lot of heat transfer, coupled with reactor design and process control. The idea was to use hot gasses to heat up the reaction chamber, so I tried to estimate the rate of pyrolysis at different temperatures using data I could find on the subject, do the heat transfer calculations, and optimize the design. The sawdust would be entering the reactor at one end, with a ball mill inside the reactor spinning, a nitrogen purge preventing oxidation, and hot gasses circulating around the chamber to control the temperature.  The product would be carbon black powder.
"Not only in Germany. As Sweden was stuck behind both the British blockade of the North Sea and the German blockade of Skagerack, there was fuel here either. We call it ""gengas"" though."
Usually the stuff for art comes in a nice to use pencil shape but other than that it is the same.
When you burn it without oxygen, the carbon can't really burn as well as the other components of the wood. So when it's done, you're left with a material that's much more carbon by volume and can burn hotter because of it. 
"Its not actually circulation of BLOOD (if it was, those limbs or body parts would die off)  , its nerves being compressed and cut off . When ever you sit in a position or are in a position for a while that can COMPRESS nerves, they will stop transmitting. The nerve cells themselves will TRY to transmit at first, but when they don't receive feedback, they stop. This is the ""numbness"" or ""this body part fell asleep"" that we all experience. When the compression ends, the nerves can sense this and all at once begin a chain of ""testing"" aka sending out signals to all cells affected down the line, to make sure they are still there. Its like the electrical grid firing back up. It feels painful because our nerves use pain a response. The sensory organs in our brain after about 30 seconds to 120 seconds will shut this test firing pattern off and resume normal operations. But that time in between is pretty painful. It feels like Pins and needles because each sensation is a nerve "" thread ending "" being tested.

"Hey! This was actually one of the first /askscience questions I answered. Copy of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/30d61w/when_a_part_of_your_body_falls_asleep_can_it/cprhn58/?st=jjt35mqo&sh=a680b675) below. ***** The tingly feeling is usually related more to nerve impingement/entrapment. It's actually pretty hard to completely cut off blood flow to your limbs by compressing/ligating vulnerable vessels. Using the arm as an example, here is the [blood supply](http://imgur.com/CMtLdm4), and the [nerve supply](http://imgur.com/CgykZRR) to the upper limb. (Source: Netter's *Atlas of Human Anatomy*). In the first image, note all the vessels that branch off of the subclavian, sections labelled 1 & 2. The vessels that wrap around the back of the scapula (shoulder blade) and connect with the others around the glenohumeral joint (where the ball of the humerus meets the socket of the shoulder blade) provides *collateral circulation* even if the subclavian/brachial artery is pinched shut in the axilla (armpit), the most vulnerable point.  Now look at the nerves. With the exception of the musculocutaneous nerve, all the nerves that innervate the upper limb pass through the 'pit' of the axilla that is vulnerable to compression (The MC nerve is also vulnerable, just less so).  The same applies to compression at other vulnerable points, there's almost always better collateral blood supply than there is innervation, since taking out nerve supply upstream cuts off the downstream more effectively than with blood flow.  ****  I was a a second (or 1st?) year med student at the time so I'll expand a little - I focused on macro scale blood flow in that answer & waved the rest away as ""nerve compression"", but what actually happens with nerve compression? It's likely related to ischemia/impaired flow, but at the *microvascular* level supplying the nerve. The nerves have tiny blood vessels (vasa ~~vasorum~~ *nervorum*) that supply them, and compressing the nerve will compress these and can compromise the blood supply to the nerve.  [This abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10679707/) has a decent overview, relevant part quoted below:  >while the membrane depolarization produced by ischemia affects both transient and persistent Na(+) channels. Postischemic and posttetanic paresthesias occur when hyperpolarization by the Na(+)/K(+) pump is transiently prevented by raised extracellular K(+). The electrochemical gradient for K(+) is reversed, and inward K(+) currents trigger regenerative depolarization. These mechanisms of paresthesia generation can account for paresthesias in normal subjects and may be relevant in some peripheral nerve disorders.  The gist of which is that 1) cuteneous & superficial sensory nerves are more likely to have ""false"" firing (see section above where I quoted) not related to actual stimuli; 2) ischemia (lack of blood flow) causes tissue pH to lower, this is balanced by exchange of Hydrogen ions outside cells for potassium ions inside such that Potassium in the fluid is higher. Then when this hits a tipping point, potassium flows back into the cells - including the nerve. This triggers depolarization (aka firing) of the nerve.  Typing this out between patients, please let me know if you have any questions or want more explanation of something! Hope this answered your question.  Edit: vasa nervorum, not vasa vasorum"
Made the most sense. Thank you! 
Spot on answer.   Worth noting that the correct term for this sensation is ‚Äúparaesthesia‚Äù
I recall reading an analysis of this phenomenon many years ago in scientific american. The shower head does generate airflow, but also in a hot shower the warm air goes out over the top, sucking in cold air at floor level, causing the curtain to blow in.   I tried to find it again, but failed. Instead, [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/) is a modern equivalent analysis of the airflow using a finite element simulation - it seems comprehensive enough. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower-curtain_effect  Hopefully Wikipedia is an allowed source (I'm too lazy to check the sidebar on mobile) but it's not necessarily a determined cause yet.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/  This article though does provide one likely cause, backed up by fluid simulations and a pretty graphic.  Basically the flow of water forms a vortex of low pressure that sucks the curtain in.
Hot water heats the air in the shower, it rises over the top of the curtain. Cold air comes in from below and pushes the curtain in to replace it. Everyone has told you this already, but no one said to leave a small gap between the curtain and the wall to allow the cold air in. This will prevent the phenomenon from happening. 
As people have pointed out it's a combination of the [Bernoulli effect and (when available) thermal dynamics](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kybBoxBAOkE/U18FXdCTlJI/AAAAAAAABV0/p1y6rQr24hs/s1600/the+shower+curtain+effect+explained.jpg) of air being warmed by the shower droplets. But the reason for my comment is your second point: *how to prevent it*.  One thing is to get weights or in the case of a metallic bathtub magnets and place them on the sides of the tub with the curtain between the surface and the magnet. This will reduce the effect, especially if you can get them at both corners and the middle rim of the tub as well.  Some shower curtains have these weights/magnets [built in](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CkxSQJRO1AY/U7qDB9CTG7I/AAAAAAAABnU/sm6bhCGZVZ8/s1600/magnetic+shower+curtain+has+magnets+embedded.jpg), while others have [suction cups](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9cfUx4t_Zt4/VLHE4bXr3wI/AAAAAAAACJI/Y8GTzf0naAU/s1600/heavy-weights-for-shower-curtain-bottom.jpg) at the bottom. Alternatively you can also buy kits that allow you alter your current curtain with [hook and latch](https://ourhumbleabodeblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/master-bathroom-shower-curtain-hooks.jpg?w=399&h=600) anchors.
This is the most correct answer. I don't know what the hell everyone else is on about. The hot water rapidly warms the air around it, causing the air to movie upward and out of the shower space. Colder air then rushes in, pushing the curtain with it.
[Here you go](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/). Stole if from the [Wikipedia article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower-curtain_effect), which was posted by u/jamincan [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6cmj7m/why_does_my_shower_curtain_seem_to_gravitate/dhvwigp/). 
There is also the Bernoulli principle and airflow induction. Essentially, any quickly moving fluid will pull other fluids along with it via induction. In a shower, the primary fluid is water and the secondary fluid is air inside the shower, which convects around the flow of the spray. This causes a situation where the air inside the shower is moving faster than the air outside and here the Bernoulli principle takes hold: faster moving air has a lower relative air pressure. Suddenly, the higher air pressure outside is pushing the curtain in, similar to the way the higher pressure of slower air under a wing pushes it up.  This compounds the effect of the hot air rising out the top of the curtain and creating a chimney effect in the shower.  To see a simple demonstration of this effect, just get a drinking straw and a strip of paper. Hold the paper vertically in one hand and blow air on one side, and watch as the paper shifts towards the stream of air!
So like, on each side of the curtain?  Genious, I'll try that tomorrow morning.  There's nothing worse than a wet shower curtain hitting certain body parts! *shrugs*
I don't know, but [the article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/) he mentions is about how this hot water theory is wrong, as the effect also happens with cold water. So maybe that's what they're on about?
As someone who *hates* feeling the cold air from opening the shower curtain, I just hold down either side of the curtain with shampoo bottles and it usually stays in place.
Okay, someone want to try this with cold water?  The hot rising air theory send solid to me- I moved the top of the curtain to within an inch of the ceiling so that the hot air would have a harder time escaping, and that helped.
Yeah, sometimes I'll slightly open the curtain side that's farthest away from the showerhead to allow airflow and that seems to help too. 
It's also important to remember body temperature and the heat capacity of water, in addition to how we perceive temperature. Water that feels cold may still be higher than the air temperature, and drive the change mentioned in the parent comment; albeit at a slower rate.  Body temperature is generally warmer than ambient, which is part of the reason why solids (metal utensils, glasses, water, etc, which rest at or around the ambient/air temp) feel cold when you pick them up. These materials transfer more heat from the body, and this change over time is what our bodies detect.   Much the same reason why a 20¬∞(68¬∞F) day is a bit brisk, while a pool of the same temperature feels much colder. It's pulling more heat out of the body than air does, but they're both the same difference from 37¬∞ (98.6¬∞F) body temperature.  ^(Edit: added alternate units)
Fie! Hiss! Get out of here with your fancy double curtains! Not everyone can afford this kind of decadence! 
Acid rain was caused by SO2 emissions from coal plants, **which have been cut by >90% since 1990**.   The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments kicked off a cap-and-trade scheme that incentivized coal plants to install scrubbers and/or switch to low-sulfur coal, then low-cost natural gas took ~50% of coal's market share since 2008.  Bottom line: coal is somewhat cleaner than it used to be, and we're burning far less of it.  [SOURCE](https://www3.epa.gov/airmarkets/progress/reports/index.html)
The reduction in the prevalence of acid rain in the US is largely been attributed to the success of the EPAs Acid Rain Program.  All rain is somewhat acidic from rainwater forming carbonic acid from rainwater reacting with carbon dioxide, but acid rain is particularly lower in pH. This is due to the reaction of rainwater with nitrogen and sulfur oxides to form the much stronger nitric and sulfuric acids, respectively. The primary source of these nitrogen and sulfur oxides is power plant emissions, particularly those burning coal. The Ohio River Valley contains a large concentration of these power plants, and acid rain issues in the US were largely concentrated around this region and points downwind (the Atlantic Coast).  The Acid Rain Program was begun in 1990 based under the Clean Air Act. It established a market-based (cap and trade) system of regulation upon which emitters of sulfur and nitrogen oxides were granted pollution allowances. Polluters were incentivized to voluntary undertake measures to reduce the volume of their emissions as they could sell unused allowances for profit.  By most estimates, the Acid Rain Program has been largely successful. The Pacific Research Institute has estimated that this program has reduced total acid rain levels by 65% from 1976 levels while the EPA estimates the program cost businesses only a quarter of what was originally estimated. Savings in property damage and human health costs, such as lowered incidences of heart and lung problems exacerbated by acid rain, most likely have resulted in the Acid Rain Program actually saving money, overall.
It is still there, albeit most data shows a decline in the prevalence due to consistent progress in reducing emissions.  The pH ~~acidity~~ of rain is decreased (made more acidic) primarily through the action of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  One of the biggest changes has been the result of a significant decrease in sulfur dioxide generation by China.  Parts of the US has seen some change, however other regions showed almost no improvement, if any at all regarding the pH of its rainwater in this timeframe.  The other aspect of this is that acid rain isn't nearly as harmful as people thought it was in the 90's, at least in terms of the public perception.  Acid rain is typically in the 5.0-5.5 pH range, with parts of the US seeing as low as 4.5 pH.  On one hand, when compared to something like a can of Coca-Cola which has a pH of ~2.3 this seems like it is nothing, but on the other hand, the effects of acid rain cover such a large surface area that it is not appropriate to compare it simply in terms of acidity.  There is a little bit of controversy as to just how harmful acid rain actually is, but most experts agree the most affected part of the environment are the various bodies of water, which are more susceptible to pH changes.  The amount and acidity of acid rain isn't enough to kill off wildlife outright in most cases, however it does cause the water to leech aluminum from the soil.   Most of this information is pop science that is easily searchable.  I do not mean this in a pedantic tone, but rather as encouragement for others to search for themselves because it is a topic that has a lot of data but also quite a bit of emotions and opinions that are not based on facts.  Edit: pH not acidity in the second sentence.  Very few things increase when it also decreases :D
I wish they would highlight victories like this more often.  Environmentalism usually feels like a bunch of looming catastrophes that never end up really being anything.  The fact that the reason they don't end up being catastrophes is that we take action to stop them is completely lost on the average person like myself, so that the original hype ends up looking like some chicken-little sky-is-falling shit, and we aren't even told that the sky WAS falling and we legislated against that.
I had heard that this was originally spearheaded by Bush Administration and Environmental Defense fund, described to me as strange bedfellows at the time.  Also heard, there was significant cost-benefit analysis done with regards to the coatings required for automobiles due to future acid rain damage.  I think the costs to society to reduce high sulfur emissions was far lower than the incremental automobile costs.
"> Bottom line: coal is somewhat cleaner than it used to be, and we're burning far less of it.  If ""we"" means the US, you're right. The US is burning around 30% less coal than it was in the 90s.  If ""we"" means the world, you're wrong. The world is burning nearly 50% more coal now than it did in the 90s, though usage peaked in 2016.  Thank China for the increase; China alone burns nearly as much coal annually as the whole world did 20 years ago, though they have also peaked.  [Source](https://yearbook.enerdata.net/coal-lignite/coal-world-consumption-data.html)"
"> The fact that the reason they don't end up being catastrophes is that we take action to stop them is completely lost on the average person like myself,  Y2K.  ""But nothing happened!"" - yeah, because we all busted our asses for 2 years leading up to it just so that nothing would happen."
EDF has a reputation for being pretty pragmatic and open to market-oriented policies compared to other large environmental NGOs (e.g.; Sierra Club, NRDC, and definitely Greenpeace).  SO2 cap-and-trade was a major coup, cheaper and more effective than a specific mandate to use whatever filtering or fuel technology was available in the late 80's/early 90's.
"That was because the mechanism was ""market based"", aka a ""cap-n-trade"" program. Other environmental groups (and the Democrats) favored a tougher regulatory approach (basically mandating use of filters and hard restrictions on emissions).   Back then no one really argued over the science (Sulfur emissions cause acid rain) so the debate was just how to combat it, with Republicans favoring market mechanisms and Democrats favoring traditional regulation. Now of course that is changed."
It think it‚Äôs wrong to blame China alone, while several countries including the us outsource many of their production to China and leave their pollution there
H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, you can sell to for a profit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid  Or in short, the profit generated is an incentive to get rid of the pollution.
It was so good, it worked to disincentivize continued production of high sulfur coal (except for export to China). When Carbon cap and trade was proposed to put the same logic on fossil fuels for global warming, the oil industry got into high gear to stop that shit. They'd seen the writing on the wall. 
Government regulation led to new profit streams? This doesn't fit the narrative. 
It wasn‚Äôt just hype. It was a real threat that was by and large handled. They brought old COBOL programmers out of retirement to fix legacy systems.  People were so ridiculous after, like they were disappointed there was no apocalypse.
"I think the issue is more that while sulfur is ""optional"" when burning coal, carbon is mandatory (until and unless someone actually gets carbon capture and storage to work at scale, which no one has done yet).  An administratively determined cap would be an enormous target for political lobbying, with annual battles pitting utilities against environmental NGOs.  Can you imagine the wangling when a cold December causes utilities to hit the cap prior to the end of the year?  A much better option for unavoidable but undesirable emissions is a ""Pigovian"" tax, in this case a tax per ton of emitted CO2.  It applies leverage against emitters but without the wild market gyrations caused by a hard cap."
The industrial/engineering world has some really smart people looking into ways to reduce harmful environmental effects and add salable product streams in their processes.  It's a win for everyone, the government, the people in the community, and even the companies who might have to pony up some larger startup/redesign costs for their industrial processes. 
Yes, very slowly.  Light has momentum, even though it is massless, so if you shoot a beam of light in one direction, conservation of momentum will push you in the opposite direction.  A reasonably powerful LED flashlight will use about 1-3 Watt, lets say 3 W. The efficiency of a LED is somewhere between 25% and 40%, so for sake of ease of computation lets make that 33% and we get a net amount of light output of 1 W.   The ratio between the momentum and energy of light is 299,792,458 (Which is also the speed of light). So in 1 second, the flashlight produces 1 J worth of light, which is equal to 0.33 * 10^-8 kg m/s. If the flashlight is not too heavy, say 100 gram or 0.1 kg, that means that 1 second of light would propel the flashlight to a velocity of 10^-7 m/s. This assumes that all light is directed in straight line. The more cone-shaped the bundle of light is, the lower the momentum transfer is.  Leaving the light on for one day would propel the flashlight to about 0.009 m/s or almost 1 cm per second. Unfortunately, operating a 3 W LED for a day uses about 260 kJ of energy. Regular AA batteries have somewhere around 10 kJ of energy (depending on the type). And at a weight of 20-30 grams per battery, you can't carry put more than 2-3 in the device without violating our original assumption of a 100 gram device.
As an addendum to the information already provided here:  Its not just visible light that'll produce a tangible thrust.  Any wavelength of light will.   This becomes a problem for space probes, because electronics and power supplies turning on and off create heat in the infrared spectrum, and these infrared photons cause a small thrust which over long periods of time will cause the probe to veer off course.  There's actual computer simulation and modeling done at NASA to account for this infrared-thrust effect when setting probe trajectories and course corrections.
As other answers have said, Yes.  In terms of using this as actual spaceship propulsion (powered by solar panels), there is a slightly easier way:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail  Which reflects the sun's light to generate (tiny amounts of) thrust!
"> Leaving the light on for one day would propel the flashlight to about 0.009 m/s or almost 1 cm per second. Unfortunately, operating a 3 W LED for a day uses about 260 kJ of energy. Regular AA batteries have somewhere around 10 kJ of energy (depending on the type). And at a weight of 20-30 grams per battery, you can't carry put more than 2-3 in the device without violating our original assumption of a 100 gram device.  That... that's actually way way way faster than I would have expected, even acknowledging the lack of batteries that would provide the necessary energy at the required weight. Awesome calculation... thanks!  Suppose we were to create the usually-a-joke ""solar powered flashlight"" and keep it in that weight profile. I'm not sure of the efficiency of our best solar cells currently, and I'm not sure it would be sufficient to generate 3W even if all the battery weight was replaced with a solar system, but at whatever trickle it gave, would that provide a basically unlimited (albeit ridiculously low power) propulsion system? Does the acceleration continue to build up over time (1cm/s day 1, 2cm/s day 2, etc) or would it hit an exceedingly low maximum speed in relatively short order (ignoring the effects of gravity and such). I'm having amusing visions of a tiny flashlight puttering off through deep space for all eternity.   Edits for grammar."
It's incredible how many different factors they have to consider when doing these calculations... o.o
"What you're suggesting is an inefficient approach to building a ""solar sail"". Instead of catching the sunlight with a solar panel, converting it to electricity and then using said electricity to power a flashlight, with losses at every step along the way, you can simply take a large reflective surface and let the sunlight bounce off it.  The incoming sunlight has some momentum and when reflected completely, the outgoing light has equal and opposite momentum, which means that the net gain in momentum by the spacecraft is twice the momentum of the incoming light. By changing the angle of the reflective surface with respect to the incoming sunlight, you can steer the craft.  You'll only ever be able to move away from the sun in this way, not closer. But the same is true if you would capture the light with solar cells and use it to power a flashlight (which can shine in arbitrary direction), since capturing the light with a solar panel also causes a momentum transfer from the sunlight to the craft."
Only in classic Newtonian physics. When nearing c and mass nearing zero, you get relativistic momentum.  E^2 = (p \* c)^2 + ( m_0 \* c^2 )^2  In low speeds, the equations align.
Yeah, it gives me a headache trying to account for everything that could affect a spaceship's journey from one point to another. I think the scientists got most of that information down in the initial testing period. I guess it helps that they had a whole agency of bright people on it. 
Assuming the craft is in a heliocentric orbit, couldn't the sail be angled to reduce the orbital velocity, and then perhaps folded up while the craft coasts to its new (lower) perihelion?
I've always been so curious about how huge intellectually intense projects like space exploration or physics experiments are managed. Does the smartest one oversee the project and instruct other still very smart people to focus on different tasks? One guy takes care of fuel, another takes care of HOW much fuel, the other takes care of the gas can.
Yes, I didn't really consider orbits (and gravity) in my original comment. Obviously the story becomes more complicated if you do.
It's not necessarily the smartest one who manages the others.  At that level, everyone involved is smart.  Scientists and engineers end up specializing in different things as their careers progress.  Some will specialize in fuel, for instance.  Another in fuel pumps, perhaps.  Others will end up specializing in managing projects like what you're talking about.  So when NASA or someone wants to do a project, they start by hiring a scientist who is very good at managing projects, and then he goes out and hires other scientists of other specialties depending on what the project is.    Source: I'm a scientist (engineer) who manages projects of hundreds or sometimes even thousands of other scientists, engineers, and technicians.
> Obviously the story becomes more complicated if you do.  But not as complicated as trying to fly a solar sailed, well anything, without thinking in terms of orbit and just trying to fly it around in straight lines
The light loses energy when it is reflected. So the wavelength will slightly increase with each bounce.  EDIT: There are a lot of replies to OP which are incorrect. Even with a 100% efficient set of mirrors (with no heat loss), even if you somehow got the bounces to perfectly reflect back and forth, there is an *inherent loss of energy* in the photons when they change momentum by bouncing off the mirror. 
Then you're imagining too small a sail!  Solar sailed space ships in scifi are often coke-can sized computers connected via nano-filaments to many square kilometers of nanometer thin sails.   Once you're kinda far away from your star, it might be worth investing in a big, space station based laser and keep firing it at the sail 24/7.
Now I'm imagining people at a port blowing at the sails on a ship.  It's interesting how some apparently meaningless things work, when scaled up.
"There are number systems which do just as you describe. Here are two (I don't know of others) such examples of this:  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere  The latter is the extension by defining z/0 in the complex plane.  A lot of the math rules are the same as you're used to, but there are important differences. For example in the projectively extended reals statements such as  * a > b  * a set of all numbers between -4 and 7 is [-4...-1...0...7]  are no longer meaningful without extra context. I can always pass through infinity to just as easily write  * a < b  * a set of all numbers between -4 and 7 is [-4...-10...infinity...7]  With some added assumptions of what ""a"" and ""b"" are and where infinity is on your interval if it's included, you can restore the idea of order and intervals."
There are many good answers already, but I think there's a simpler one that has to do with inverses.  An inverse is a sort of mathematical undo, it reverses the action of some function.  Instead of thinking of division and subtraction as operations, think of them as inverse multiplication and addition.  When you see `5 + x = 7` we can solve this using an inverse: `x = 5 + x + (-5) = 7 + (-5) = 2`. We can construct the integers from the naturals by *closing* the addition operation through the extension of negative numbers.  When we try the same thing with multiplication, we get the rational numbers. Given `x * 3 = 6` we can use the multiplicative inverse of 3, one third, to solve the equation: `x * 3 * (1/3) = x = 6 * (1/3) = 2`.  We cannot actually close the rationals under multiplication, because of zero. The closest thing to do is take the set of rational numbers except for zero and treat this as a multiplicative group.  Since zero times anything is zero, we have `0*x = 0`. Since `x = 5` is just as valid a solution as `x = -1`. Since no unique solution for `x` gets determined by the equation, there's no way to assign a consistent value to the multiplicative inverse of zero.  TL;DR: zero times anything is zero, so it's impossible to undo that multiplication and figure out what you started with.
When you define i such as i¬≤=-1, you can just use it the same way as any real constant, and keep doing math.  If you define a constant to be equal to 1/0 and try to keep doing math with it, you will find contradictions at every corner. First quick example to come in mind: if we call it b (why not), then 1/b is, obviously 0, but what is 1/(b+1)? If it is zero, then b+1=b so 1=0. If it is not, then you just found a finite value for b.
"The problem is that x*0=0 for all x so if you invert multiplication then x=0/0 also for all x. This contains no information. If you allow this you can ""prove"" things like 1=2 (All those wrong proofs contain a hidden division by zero)"
Another system that works out just fine is what comes out of [Graphical Linear Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/). There, if you try to divide by zero, you end up with another object, which is labeled ‚àû. But then as it turns out there are two other ‚Äúinfinities‚Äù that show up if you play around with 0 and ‚àû, which show a bunch of curious rules. Among other things it turns out that 0\*‚àû ‚â† ‚àû\*0, which is kinda weird. Since that is true for all other numbers, you lose some important structure. There‚Äôs also no natural way to order these new numbers, so 1<‚àû isn‚Äôt true or false but just senseless.
There's a structure called a wheel that I *very* briefly studied, which also defines 0/0 (but then you lose even more of the rules you're used to): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory  I remember talking about the wheel of fractions in particular, where things like this happen:  * 0 * 1/0 = 0/0, so you can't always say 0x = 0 or x/x = 1 * 1/0 - 1/0 = 0/0, so you can't always say x - x = 0
By the way, the projective *plane* (extended Euclidean plane) is a very important part of the Elliptic Curve group theory, which you're probably using at this moment while browsing reddit. HTTPS/SSL/TLS rely on cryptography to communicate securely with the server, and some of it may use Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman.
Yeah this.  If you have division by 0 you can't have a field, so the things that do have division by 0 can't be algebraic, and end up being more geometric things where you aren't usually dividing and multiplying anyway.
This is the best answer. If there was a use to define a division by 0 in some useful way, we would have done so.
Wow thats super interesting.
That isn't what is meant by inverse in this situation. The operations `plus(1,5)` and `plus(2,4)` both produce the result `6`. You also can't *undo* the number 6 to deduce definitively which input values were added to produce that result; that isn't what is being discussed here.  The quality of the inverse operation discussed here refers to the fact that applying the inverse function to an  output of the original function and the second operand of the original function produces one unique result \- the first operand. Specifically, `minus(plus(a,b),b) = a` and `divide(multiply(a,b),b)=a` are both almost always valid statements, except for specific degenerative cases. For this discussion, `inverse(operation(a,b),b)=a` .
"Does saying ""b+1 = b"" feel like ""use it the same way as any real constant, and keep doing math"" to you ? "
If you want to know the details, I encourage you to read on the linked blog. The first few lessons are extremely accessible, then it gets a bit more complex as he goes on to prove all the claims he made actually hold, and then it gets more accessible again. The relevant lesson is [26. Keep Calm and Divide by Zero](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/12/14/26-keep-calm-and-divide-by-zero/), to understand it you‚Äôll definitely need to read the first bunch, maybe up to number 9, which are all pretty light and introduce the whole notation of GLA (after that the proofs start). You‚Äôll need to figure out some other things from the later lessons, too, but it should be pretty intuitive then, just don‚Äôt let the fancy words scare you.
The commutative property is hugely important to abstract algebra for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is in finding important substructure of groups, etc. 
Yeah ‚Äúuseful‚Äù there was misguided. If we could find a way to define it that was both *consistent* with existing theory and *free from contradiction* we would have done so.
Yes! There's a lot of research going into tinnitus. The DOD funds a good portion of it (turns out loud explosions and artillery are destroying the hearing of our active troops and vets.)  I'm sure there are many groups working on this, but I know the Tzounopoulos group at the University of Pittsburgh is actively working on a drug to cure/prevent tinnitus. Not my area of expertise so I don't know the specifics of the project, but here is a link to his website. Some of his papers may be interesting to OP and anyone else looking for info.     http://phrc.pitt.edu/people/thanos-tzounopoulos
Tinnitus is often associated with noise-induced hearing loss, which is in turn caused by damage and death of hair cells in the cochlea. These cells are responsible for sensing vibrations and translating them to nerve signals to be sent to the brain. Once damaged or destroyed they cannot regenerate naturally. However several methods of inducing hair cell regeneration are currently under investigation, see [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534485/).  EDIT: As you can tell from my flair I am not an expert on this topic and I've only done some cursory reading because I have mild tinnitus myself, I won't be able to answer any questions that I'm not familiar with.
I am not a doctor or scientist but have done extensive research, participated in Tinnitus groups, and had multiple well educated Audiologists and Otolaryngologists and was very fortunate to have them. These were people who attended conferences and were always staying ahead of the curve in understanding the research and trials available, in the pipeline, and being discussed.  Many doctors have also said the same thing and it seems to be consensus - without having tinnitus it is difficult to assess from the outside, and there have been many audiologists I have seen in other cities who I have had the opportunity to educate based on my experience. There is a limited number of people worldwide who are truly invested in this condition.  ‚Äã  **What is it?**  Tinnitus (tin-ih-tus) is a catchall used to describe hearing noise when there is no external source present. Common understanding always brings this discussion to two of the most basic causes - trauma or long term degradation.  Trauma can be a single external event, such as a gun firing, explosion, a crash, but could even be smaller things too. There is some consensus (but it is not a silver bullet) that a shot of prednisone into the ear OR a regimen of oral prednisone taken within 48 hours (24 hours or earlier preferably) can limit the damage of a severe auditory trauma.  Long term degradation is similar to trauma, but is the result of noises less than severe auditory trauma over the course of a lifetime.  ‚Äã  These are the best understood because they affect the most people - those who have had military service, and the elderly. These cases affect the vast majority of tinnitus users, but the severity of the tinnitus in a good portion of these is manageable and most likely monotone in nature. The movies you may have seen depict this kind of tinnitus very well, and you may have even experienced it yourself after a night out at a concert, bar etc only for it to slowly die down over the next few days.  ‚Äã  As others here have stated, there is work here that focuses on the idea that hair cell regeneration may be a positive factor in repairing the damage.  \---------  **What is it** ***really?***  Now to the more extensive understanding. Tinnitus is really a neurological issue, despite the cause. I know many are hopeful for the ear hair cell regeneration but this is not as promising to tinnitus in general as it seems.  ‚Äã  There are many other causes for Tinnitus - a side effect of medication, infection (not just ear, but viral infections in the brain), acoustic neuroma, Meniere's disease, blood vessel issues, muscular issues, TMJ, and others!  Due to tinnitus having many causes there are some treatments which affect others and which do not work for most. There is even a type of tinnitus which is objective and the doctor could actually hear the noise, this is from blood vessels and is called pulsating tinnitus.  ‚Äã  Since tinnitus is so broad and there are many underlying factors, it is incredibly difficult to 'cure' as you would only be treating some specific types of tinnitus. The type of noise people hear, the frequency, severity, number of tones/pitches, the nature of the noise, etc are all very very different although the name tinnitus is used to describe all of these. This means that it is very hard to create an accurate sample of people to run tests on, as the description and type of tinnitus may be very unique for people, and is also dependent on subjective evaluation by the subjects themselves.  The nature of tinnitus is normally that it is not constant on every day and can change in severity, volume, frequency etc on a daily or hourly basis. Tracking progress on treatment can be hard due to this, and there are a lot of factors that *could* impact tinnitus such as stress (#1), diet, sleep, external factors like noise, and others.  ‚Äã  **The good news**  The good news is there are promising steps being made to treat the neurological causes and factors of tinnitus. To understand research both past and present, a tremendous resource is [https://www.tinnitustalk.com/forums/research-news.4/](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/forums/research-news.4/) which is a collection of tinnitus sufferers who have had it for years or decades and stay very active in the community and do a ton of research as well as share experiences if they participate in trials.  ‚Äã  There have been many medications developed, all of which have failed at the second trial round usually, which attempt to address potassium channels that can lead to the reduction or elimination of tinnitus. There is some promise here but the majority of these medications treat another primary cause like seizures and the added effect on tinnitus is secondary which makes trials for those with tinnitus ineligible. There have also been many trials with different medications which you can clearly see on that TinnitusTalk research board.  ‚Äã  Other attempts at solutions have involved treatments to the brain with magnetic or electrical stimulation to address the neuroplasticity of the brain. Many of these are new and again will never be a silver bullet but could be a general use to assist those who are eligible due to the potential for reduction or elimination. rTMS or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was a hot button for a while, and there are other treatments that are always in the pipeline but require much time and are essentially unattainable for the near future.  ‚Äã  **The even better news**  ‚Äã  Research here is growing exponentially, and we understand more every day.  ‚Äã  **The bad news**  There is a massive lack of funding for research here though and also a very low potential for ROI for pharmaceutical companies due to potential medications not having enough people that the cost of research and manufacturing would far outweigh those who could be positively affected and need prescriptions. A good few promising companies have gone under and hold on to all their research and it has not been shared with the scientific community, halting a lot of progress in a potential search for treatment.  ‚Äã  **Resources**  ‚Äã  If you're interested, [tinnitustalk.com](https://tinnitustalk.com) is a fantastic resource which contains a lot of very knowledgeable individuals. Be careful as there are tons of differing opinions and take no one person's words as fact, **INCLUDING MINE!** Also, us tinnitians (as a lovely facebook group member called us) can be a very very angry bunch due to living in eternal hell day in and day out so there is some petty bickering that happens here.  The American Tinnitus Association [www.ata.org](https://www.ata.org) is a GREAT resource, and **PLEASE if you are shopping Amazon for Christmas try using the Smile program to donate to them!** The British Tinnitus Association is also at the front of the global community too.  ‚Äã  ‚Äã  **TL;DR**  Nope we're in trouble. There are tons of programs in existence and being developed that work to manage tinnitus, but there is no 'cure' in sight, and there may never actually be one! Too many causes and difficulty in getting reliable data along with poor ROI for companies discourages research.
Yes! Gene therapy is being worked on by multiple research firms across the globe. The most notable being Frequency Therapeutics who have a drug currently in phase 1/2 of testing. It's called FX-322 and it's an injection into the eardrum. It works by regenerating the hair cells responsible for the conditions in the first place. If things go well, the drug could possibly be 5-6 years away from release. Research for hearing loss and tinnitus has picked up a lot momentum in the past couple of years due to increased funding from multiple companies and governments. The reason that it is so late is because until now, the mechanisms behind the ear and the brain were not understood very well. Now that research has caught up, multiple solutions are being worked on. 
See [Meniere's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re%27s_disease) for another example of tinnitus and hearing loss. Because of the Meniere's, my tinnitus is broadband noise, rather than a tone or ringing. It sounds similar to sticking one's head out the window of a fast moving car. And the vertigo is absolutely the worst thing I have ever experienced physically.  Several commenters below recommend seeing an ENT. Actually, you should seek out an Otolaryngologist. 
I thought tinnitus was linked with brain function as opposed to hearing loss which is linked with cell death. 
It is a disorder of the auditory system and the leading hypothesis is that the noise itself is generated in the central nervous system. However this is most often preceded by noise-induced hearing loss. The absence of input from the cochlea leads to abnormal activity in the auditory cortex, which produces the sensation of tinnitus. See [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3918281/) for some details.
No they‚Äôre not. Auditory hair cells (stereocilia) are fingerling and taut(**) across two membranes (tectorial and basilar), like strings on a guitar. They pick up different frequencies depending on their size (there are a few different sizes of sterocilia) and how they vibrate related to what basal cells and receptors they are rooted to. Signals from these stereocilia are translated to the auditory cranial nerve.   Hearing loss occurs when these stereocilia are exposed to frequent loud noises or other disruptions to the inner ear. When these stereocilia cannot move properly, they cannot detect noise and send signals to the auditory nerve. Stem cell treatments are being researched to regenerate these sterocilia and their connections to the auditory nerve.  The hairs on your head are not living nor cells; they are made of keratin, a rigid protein used in the body for structure. They grow from projections evolutionarily related to plaques and scales on distant mammals. 
...so it‚Äôs sorta like the body‚Äôs sound sensor is broken, and then the brain sees a floating value and interprets it as tinnitus?
"Well the reason the temperature in the past was so much higher is that the high CO2 levels persisted for many thousands of years allowing for the progressive accumulation of water vapor in the atmosphere which accelerated the greenhouse effect. CO2 is actually the second most important greenhouse gas behind water vapor, though it is often the trigger for climatic change because it's concentration in the atmosphere is controlled by a variety of complex processes where as water vapor is effectively controlled by temperature and pressure. Over time the increased temperature has a positive feedback with water in the atmosphere allowing for very elevated temperatures. It's worth noting that when we say the ""the last time"" we are taking a snapshot of a world that had been experiencing those conditions for millenia.  We currently believe we can keep the warming around 2C because we are projecting mitigation and emission reduction strategies that will eventually slow the warming trend. In the short term (geologically speaking) that means a temperature rise of around 2C."
I think a lot of the concern about methane stems from the potential positive feedback loop that exists in polar regions. There's a ton of methane locked up in the 10's of millions of square kilometres of polar permafrost regions, and if these regions melt under climate change this adds to methane emissions, which adds to GHG emissions, which leads to more warming, which leads to more permafrost melting, etc. 
"The short answer is that we don't, at least not all of us.  I certainly don't. 2C is incredibly ambitious at this point, so I'm actually with you.    However, the reasoning behind it is that CO2 to temperature isn't as simple as a 1 to 1 relationship where a CO2 level of X leads to a temperature of Y.  There are many factors in play, of which CO2 is just one.  More of it will always lead to a temperature increase, but the end value depends on a lot more, stuff like how much ice exists near the poles, solar energy, all kinds of stuff.    So in a previous ""configuration"", this CO2 level will have led to warmer temperatures at times, and probably colder temperatures at times. But in this configuration, this is what we get at this level of CO2. "
I've heard about the potency of methane as a GHG, but your post suggests it's not one of the 'top 2'. Where does methane fit into the ranking of most important GHGs?
>We currently believe we can keep the warming around 2C because we are projecting mitigation and emission reduction strategies that will eventually slow the warming trend. In the short term (geologically speaking) that means a temperature rise of around 2C.  Isn't 2C the conservative estimate, based on a very optimistic scenario of significant and immediate action? I've heard climate scientists say that it is no longer a realistic target.
Methane is a more efficient greenhouse gas than water and CO2 (because it has more vibrational modes, which are (kind of) a necessary condition for absorbing infrared radiation), but it's less abundant (parts per billion methane vs parts per million CO2 and a widely varying (but higher) number density for water).
"> because it has more vibrational modes, which are (kind of) a necessary condition for absorbing infrared radiation  Could you expand on this a little more? I understand that having a vibrational mode of the right energy will allow a molecule to absorb infrared radiation and become excited, but the ""kind of"" implies there is more to the story."
"multiphoton absorption can lead to all sorts of processes energetically, and you can change rotational energy with single infrared photons and electronic energy in certain molecules, but vibrational excitation is the ""typical"" way infrared photons are absorbed by greenhouse gases, I believe. The energy can also become kinetic, and the initial energy before absorption will change what is possible."
Apes and old-world monkeys have ABO blood types like us.   Other animals have blood types, but not the same ones as us. There are thirteen different dog blood types, but cats are categorised as A, B, or AB. Not the same as human A and B. 
Does anyone know - was there a time where the scientific community legitimately thought blood transfusion was impossible? I can't imagine it was easy figuring out blood type before certain technological advances.
I have a couple retired racing greyhounds and have a couple fun facts for you. They are universal blood donors, and with few exceptions, blood from any greyhound can be given to any other breed of dog. They are also lean with big neck veins, thin skin, and very insensitive to pain. This combination is simply perfect for blood donation.
I believe the first transfusion attempt that was recorded was a human receiving pig's blood, with now-predictable consequences.
Greyhounds also have a higher PCV (packed cell volume) than other dogs. This means that their blood has more red blood cells by volume than blood from the average dog, making it great for transfusions. 
Not to my knowledge. There are other proteins besides the A, B, AB, and rhesis factor.  Even in humans not every transfusion that's a match is equal.
The first recorded SUCCESSFUL transfusion was between two dogs performed by Richard Lower in like 1660 or something. Then people started giving lamb's blood to people. That went poorly frequently, so it was outlawed. Then they tried again (years later with human to human transfusions) and it worked. People discovered blood types and bob's your uncle.   Fun fact: they also tried transfusing (infusing?) other shit too... like milk. That also went poorly, as you can imagine. (source: I used to run a veterinary blood bank and am a veterinarian)  edit: more clarity 
Which is likely at least part of the reason they are incredible at racing; they're able to replenish oxygen at incredible rates with that. 
>Then people started giving lamb's blood to people. That went poorly frequently, so it was outlawed. Then they tried again (years later) and it worked.      Wait, humans can receive lamb blood?
I had a lurcher and it needed surgery, the anesthesia cost way more than for another breed, they said if they gave a standard anesthesia he would sleep for days! Is this true or was I getting ripped off?
"well.... yes and no... mostly no ;)  they did it back then because they thought that giving someone lamb's blood would make them calm, like a lamb. obviously that's wrong, for many reasons:   if you do give someone lamb's blood they will have a horrible ""acute hemolytic transfusion reaction."" where the recipient's existing antibodies immediately break apart (lyse) the lamb's blood. if untreated, these reactions can lead to serious complications, like kidney failure and death.   amazingly some people survived these transfusions, and in the immediate post-transfusion period they were calm ""like a lamb"" because they almost died and their bodies were barely holding onto dear life. but most people died... so they outlawed the practice.   edit: clarity "
"Yes, Greyhounds require a different anesthesia protocol than other dogs due to this very reason. Source: former vet tech  edit for clarity: The reason being their high metabolism. When they said ""sleep for days"" they meant sleep forever. Certain barbituates can kill them. Instead of just inducing with propofol and keeping under with sevo, they require additional meds like acepromazole and atropine. My doc would pop em with ace and telazole, atropine,then keep them under with sevoflourane gas... you get the picture. Extra work and meds indeed, a few breeds required this protocol"
How does it work for mixed breeds then? Like how would a vet determine which to use?
I am a vet and I disagree with a little bit of this. Modern anesthetic protocols are generally very safe for sighthounds. It is usually they older heavy sedatives (i.e. acepromazine in fact! And domitor, and yes barbiturates) that they are more sensitive to and are more risky. The typical protocols recommended by most anesthesiologists, such as an opiate + benzodiazepine + propofol induction and maintenance on sevoflurane, is most ideal. It's the heavy sedation with minimal monitoring and attention to ventilation that is an issue for them.
Usually the pre-op blood work would tell us what we needed to know, you can't beat hard evidence like that
I have always been asked by my vet if I want to do blood work before any surgery. They always framed it as not super necessary but helpful... I'm glad I have always opted to do it now!
Most vets offer it before any anaesthetic but it's up to the owner if they chose to go ahead. Many diseases are underlying, I.e they show no clinical signs. Pre-op blood work helps to identify contusions which would make anaesthesia life threatening. In young, apparently healthy dogs and cats, there are congenital conditions such as a hole in the heart, kidney dysplasia, liver shunts etc that wouldn't show up until the body is put under stress, such as anaesthesia.  For instance an apparently healthy dog might have a vein left over from when it was in the womb that bypasses the liver (a shunt), reducing oxygen supply to the organ. When anaesthetic drugs are given this puts an extra strain in the liver to break down the chemicals and it fails to compensate. This means the drugs stay in the system much longer than they should, or build to life-threatening levels. A simple test pre-anaesthesia will show the liver under strain, and more investigations can be performed to determine whether the dog is safe to undergo the procedure.
Definitely the latter; the comoving radius of the observable Universe is on the order of 10^(26) m, while the Planck length sits at about 10^(-35) m. The metre is closer to the cosmological scale than the Planck scale.

So logarithmically there is a greater difference, 4 orders of magnitude, between the planck length and a proton than a proton and a human.   Edit: there's a ""c"" in planck  "
It's interesting to note that, logarithmically, we're about in the middle. 
Correction to avoid confusion: there should be a minus sign before the 35
One could argue I'm less than 2m away from a plank length... depends if you interpret it logarithmicly. 
Before opening the thread, I quickly thought 'gotta be Planck. Sure it's tiny, but the universe is just that much bigger'.   Well shucks. 
*increasing size of 0.1mm dot to size of observable universe in own mind*   Nailed it. 
Serious question, is your reply in agreement to the above post or are you saying there's a difference between logarithmically speaking and the way that person replied?  Aren't they the same.   Also, Planck scale aside, aren't we still closer to the size of the universe than to even an atom?
give or take a factor of 10 billion. 
Universe is really big, the above size is of observable universe not the entire universe.
"The planck length is not the length of a planck, but rather just a constant named ""planck length"".  According to quantum gravity, between two points closer to each other than the planck length, the structure of spacetime becomes dominated by quantum effects, which would make it impossible to determine their distance. That means the planck length is believed to be the shortest theoretically measurable length. It has no other physical significance."
They are the same. The post is Iin agreement.  We are closer to one extreme, but also close to the middle.
>Also, Planck scale aside, aren't we still closer to the size of the universe than to even an atom?  As the size of the universe is on the order of 10^26 m and the diameter of an atom is on the order of 10^-11 m  we are on the order of 10^0 m. That means we are by far closer to the size of an atom than the universe.
"OK, follow-up question: Given that we cannot observe things outside the observable universe, is there any way to actually determine how large it is?  [edit] ""it"" in this case being the entire universe."
Or more specifically, were much closer to the middle than to either extreme.
According to the [theory of cosmic inflation](http://www.universetoday.com/83167/universe-could-be-250-times-bigger-than-what-is-observable/), the entire universe‚Äôs size is at least 10^23 times larger than the size of the observable universe.
Now I'm curious (and unsure I would do the math right) - what is the exact middle length between the two?
To be fair, even the guy who came up with that theory now thinks it's crap. At best it just kicks the can.
"10^-4.5 m is about 32 microns; a sedimentologist would classify particles of that size as ""coarse silt *or medium silt*"". (*EDIT: depending on the scale used, it could be either coarse or medium.*)  So, silt is in the exact middle."
Wow, that put into perspective just how small the planck length is... a grain of silt to the whole observable universe.
So about the size of a Tardigrade; 5*10^ -4?
Yes, and then you imagine that that piece of silt was itself a universe, and you imagine that miniuniverse itself having a piece of silt inside of it, and that is the Planck length.  (Personally I am not sure how helpful that is as the observable universe has a vastness that is beyond what I can really comprehend, but it is an interesting factoid to be sure.)
I saw a comparison where if you took a Planck length sized object and a normal proton and increased both of them in size at the same rate, by the time the Planck Object was the size of a proton, the proton would be the size of Rhode Island.
Yet more evidence that tardigrades are the true lords of the universe
‚ÄúNiagara Falls‚Äù is actually three waterfalls, the ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù, the ‚ÄúBridal veil‚Äù, and the ‚ÄúHorseshoe‚Äù  falls.  Never in recorded history have all three of them completely frozen, but the smaller two (American and Bridal Veil‚Äù) have frozen a few times.  When it happens, most of the water on the surfaces of Lake Erie and the Niagara river is already frozen so the volume of water going over the falls is reduced anyway. The rest of the moving water goes over the unfrozen parts of the Horseshoe falls.  Besides this, two big hydroelectric power plants, one American and one Canadian, divert water away from the falls to generate electricity.  This means the river and the falls have less water than they can handle anyway.    Source: grew up in the city of Niagara Falls.  This stuff is local legend and drilled into our heads as kids.  
As mentioned in previous posts, much of the water gets diverted to hydro electric plants. In the summer, during the day, there is an agreement that states the water cannot he diverted as much. This is so that tourists can see the falls ‚Äúin all their glory‚Äù. At nighttime and during the winter, much more is diverted for energy production.   As for your question. Historically speaking, ice bridges have formed, even to the point where people would play on the bridges, set up a market, and walk across to the other country‚Äôs side. This has been illegal since 1912, but even while this happened, water still flowed over the falls. Although the ice bridge was thick and sturdy, the fast flowing water runs beneath the ice, so it can look like the falls have frozen, but there is still water flowing over them, along and behind the ice. Think of it like an icy covering that‚Äôs hiding the real flow of water.   There is only one instance of the falls completely freezing over, about 150 years ago, however all the other water had completely frozen as well, so the side effects were minimal.   tl;dr If Niagara Falls ever did completely freeze over, the rest of Lake Erie probably did to, so there would be no concern for flooding or anything of the sort. 
So not one has really answered the question asked.   What would happen if Niagra falls stopped flowing completly (let's also assume the other diversions like hydro-power don't exist.   Yes, the water would start to rise behind it however it's not going to be as dramatic as you think. The river is actually just an extension of Lake Erie. In effect, you would be increasing the volume of Lake Erie since the river level is also the lake level. Lake Erie has a natural fluctuation of about a foot and historically has fluctuated about three feet (different between the max lowest level and max highest level). I can't find data for the current level however the last couple years the level has been around the average which put's it about a foot below the historical maximum. This means that it could conceivably rise a foot without causing too much of a problem (possibly some local minor flooding).  Lake Erie has a surface area of 25 744 Km^2  To raise Lake Erie by 1 cm, you would need to add 2.57 x 10^11 L of water.   2.84 x 10^6 L of water flows over Horseshoe, the American Falls, and Bridal Veil falls per second.   This means that if you shut off the falls completely (again, not accounting for the hydro production), the water level of Lake Erie would rise by 1 cm every 25h or, about a foot a month.   All of this assumes that the volume of water flowing in to the lake remains constant. In reality, the water levels won't rise that fast since the inflow of water is also reduced for similar reasons (less water is flowing in the winter as it stays frozen on the ground). This is also a very simplistic view since it doesn't take in to account evaporation which also fluctuates depending on how frozen over the lake is.   As others have pointed out though, completely freezing over doesn't mean that water isn't flowing. It's just a reduction in flow. There is only one instance where the water completely stopped flowing which happened in ~~1948~~ 1848 as a result of an ice jam. This only lasted a couple hours though. The American Falls have previously been artificially shut off as well for maintenance (erosion prevention measures)  EDIT: As pointed out by /u/Cumberlandjed, the drop to the top of the rapids is 2.7m. I originally discounted the drop since I didn't think it would be that significant. As such, depending on where the blockage happened and the height of the banks, you might just end up with localized flooding which would eventually cause the stream to divert around the blockage and flow to the canyon through another route. If the banks are high enough to contain the river over the drop, my scenario would still hold. Essentially the river would increase to the lake level.  
The falls are never truly frozen--as in frozen solid with no flow. Think about a river or lake that freezes over. The ice may be quite thick but there is still water underneath. The river is still flowing below that solid sheet of ice. So in the case of the falls, you may see ice, but there is still flow behind it. It is always flowing even in the coldest winters.
Interestingly, there are actually regulations regarding the maximum amount of water that can be diverted from the falls. We are entirely capable of 'turning off' the Niagra falls completely. 
So if the water was not diverted to generate electricity, would the falls be noticeably more vigorous?
Another fact about Niagara, they've actually stopped the whole falls part to do some repairs or something. There's a picture of it online somewhere.
Interestingly enough, they are planning on stopping the falls to do some improvements in early 2019 last I heard
Yes, and there is actually a treaty between the US and Canada in which they agreed upon minimum levels of flow over the falls at various times: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/corporate/international-affairs/partnerships-countries-regions/north-america/canada-united-states-niagara-river-treaty.html
I can only find images of the [stopped American Falls](https://i.imgur.com/WWcMxyv.jpg) (and maybe the Bridal Veil Falls) without water. Couldn't find any of the Horseshoe Falls (on the Canadian side). 
My favorite part is that America and Canada have joint custody over one of the falls. And while I'm sure there's some treaty regarding shutting part of it off, I like the idea that if there's some feud one country could just turn their side off out of spite.
"""If you won't let me play with Stretch Armstrong, I'm taking Niagra Falls and going home""  - Carmen Sandiego as a child"
More than a small city!  The combined power plants produce enough electricity to power almost 4 million homes!
I would actually go to Niagara Falls specifically to see them turn off the water. 
 I Couldn‚Äôt remember the Canadian side numbers. But you‚Äôre correct. It also saves millions of pounds of carbon pollution too!
On the US side, Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant has a 2,675 megawatt capacity. On the Canadian side, the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations can do 1,997 megawatts.  Depending on the standard you use, 750-1,200 houses are powered per megawatt. 4,672 megawatt total, so 4 million homes is a reasonable estimate.  Production is dependent on need. Midnight in winter needs less production than a 90 degree summer day, for instance. The actual production will always be well below maximum capacity. But, as long as water flows, they can put out the electricity. It's a continuous figure.   [If you're curious, it's easy to spot on Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.1461422,-79.043191,1630m/data=!3m1!1e3), they're basically across the river from each other, just north of the falls, and supplied by large reservoirs (fed from water up stream).
You know hydro is part of the green energy movement right?
Just as an interesting aside, in colder areas, electrical demand is at its highest in winter.  Here in Saskatchewan, our record electrical consumption days are always in the winter, because furnaces are running nearly 24/7, people have to plug in engine block heaters to be able to start their cars, etc.  We air condition some, but considerably less than hotter areas do, so demand is actually lower in summer than in winter.  Consumption is lowest of all in spring and autumn.
It is so that we have excess to sell here in manitoba we sell ours to other provinces to buy more green energy

This was due to the closure of the Isthmus of Panama which altered ocean currents and allowed the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to form (it may have existed in a weakened state before however). This cooled the northern hemisphere allowing ice sheets to form. The ice sheets of Antarctica had already formed at this point however around 34 Ma.

whoa!   so basically the whole ice ageWas caused by the closing of the Panamanian isthmus?  http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/how-the-isthmus-of-panama-put-ice-in-the-arctic.  >The principal engine of this global circulation, often called the Ocean Conveyor, is the difference in salt content between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Before the Isthmus of Panama existed, Pacific surface waters flowed into the Atlantic. Their waters mixed, roughly balancing the two oceans‚Äô salinity.  >About 5 million years ago, the North American, South American, and Caribbean Plates began to converge. The gradual shoaling of the Central American Seaway began to restrict the exchange of water between the Pacific and Atlantic, and their salinities diverged.  >Evaporation in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean left ocean waters there saltier and put fresh water vapor into the atmosphere. The Trade Winds carried the water vapor from east to west across the low-lying Isthmus of Panama and deposited fresh water in the Pacific through rainfall. As a result, the Pacific became relatively fresher, while salinity slowly and steadily increased in the Atlantic.  >As a result of the Seaway closure, the Gulf Stream intensified. It transported more warm, salty water masses to high northern latitudes, where Arctic winds cooled them until they became dense enough to sink to the ocean floor. The Ocean Conveyor was rolling, drawing even more Gulf Stream waters northward.  snip  >On their journey to the North Pacific, these deep waters became enriched in nutrients and carbon dioxide. In the Subarctic Pacific, these deep waters could have upwelled, rising to the sunlit surface to provide the ingredients to spark enormous blooms of phytoplankton. Great abundances of silica and opal (the preserved material from the phytoplankton shells) in seafloor sediments are evidence of both the blooms and the strong upwelling.  >The upwelling may have been so strong, however, that the phytoplankton did not keep pace with the upwelling‚Äîthat is, more carbon dioxide upwelled than was used by the phytoplankton. Consequently, the excess carbon dioxide ‚Äúleaked‚Äù back into the atmosphere, adding a greenhouse gas that warmed the planet.  >What shut down the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period about 2.7 million years ago? And what finally caused Northern Hemispheric glaciation at about the same time‚Äîbut nearly 2 million years after the Isthmus of Panama formed?  >Neal Driscoll and Gerald Haug proposed one solution. They postulated that moisture carried northward by the Gulf Stream was transported by prevailing westerly winds to Eurasia. It fell as rain or snow, eventually depositing more fresh water into the Arctic Ocean‚Äîeither directly, or via the great Siberian rivers that empty into the Arctic Ocean.  >The added fresh water would have facilitated the formation of sea ice, which would reflect sunlight and heat back into space. It would also act as a barrier blocking heat stored in the ocean from escaping to the atmosphere above the Arctic. Both these phenomena would further cool the high latitudes. In addition, Arctic waters flowing back into the North Atlantic would have become less cold and salty‚Äîshort-circuiting the efficiency of the Ocean Conveyor belt as a global heat pump to North Atlantic regions.
49 million years ago, it's thought that there was a huge CO2 decrease because a bunch of water ferns grew on the Arctic Ocean and sank:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla_event  Here's an article about people trying to recreate this event as a climate change mitigation strategy: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-the-fern-that-cooled-the-planet-do-it-again/
"Wait so in this article it says the azolla event is what created the ""icehouse"" earth, rather than the earth with palm trees and crocodiles at the poles.  So are you and the geologist guy talking about two different steps? Like this azolla event took us down from dinosaur-level warmth, and then way later the closing of the isthmus took us down to the temperature we're at today?"
I wouldn't necessarily think of it as steps. The Earth's current climate was created over many many millions of years by lots of factors. Positive feedbacks are very important in climate change and the azolla event, while significant in its own right, would have more importantly probably launched several positive feedbacks that contributed to locking up increasing amounts of carbon close to the poles, slowly decreasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature over tens of millions of years.  Simultaneously, other changes causally unrelated to organic carbon sequestration occurred as well and also contributed to the cooling trend. Especially important here are the changes in ocean currents, including the completion of the West Wind Drift, which isolated Antarctica about 30mya and the closing of the Panama isthmus abut 5mya. These effects contribute to their own important positive feedbacks as well as interacting with previous feedbacks.  So none of these things solely created the icehouse Earth of today (though it's hard to know what the effect of any single factor in isolation is because of the many interacting feedbacks), but they all contributed to an ongoing process.
Yes, there is an ice age still going on. The Earth currently has extensive glaciers and sea ice at both poles. They may not be as extensive as during the last glacial maximum, but their presence diagnoses this as a period of icehouse climate. A greenhouse period would not have any polar ice or at least not glaciers.
Generally, less temperature disparity means a more temperate planet.  So fewer glaciers and fewer deserts. More temperate.  So there would be more Jungles and forests, fewer Sahara deserts and Ice sheets the size of countries.  It's my only real gripe with the public attention that climate change gets is that very few people actually explain that it does not mean deserts and mass extinctions...quite the opposite in fact. Perhaps that isn't good for the overall optics of the dangers, but it would be more honest.
Those are called sunspots. They are areas of the sun's surface that are cooler than the rest of it. They're still very hot, just not hot enough for the light they're emitting to be enough to see through eclipse glasses. Basically, there are strong magnetic fields in those locations that are inhibiting the normal surface convection of those areas, thus keeping them somewhat cooler than the rest of the sun.
From r/astronomy, should answer your question :)  [If you still have your eclipse glasses, take a look at the Sun today - there are currently two enormous naked eye sunspot groups facing our planet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/6y16bi/if_you_still_have_your_eclipse_glasses_take_a/)
Earth-facing sunspots AR2673 and AR2674.  I received the http://spaceweather.com/ alert for them just last night!  If you've taken on a more than passing interest in the sun as it sounds like you have, you might consider signing up for their alerts - they'll let you know about Coronal Mass Ejections as they happen so you can have some lead time to get to a dark area to see the aurora!
Wait.. you can just stare at the sun whenever with eclipse glasses? 
One of the sunspot groups has grown tremendously in just the last day or so, here's a cool GIF of it:  http://spaceweather.com/images2017/04sep17/sunspots_anim.gif?PHPSESSID=q66lf7ihj64s5nvk96jco0g392  The larger spots within the groups are larger than the planet Earth.  The growing spot group, known as AR2673, is active, and being monitored for flares or other disturbances.  It is facing Earth directly, and if it blows, could spray a blast at us.  Go here, might have to scroll down a bit, great pics:  http://spaceweather.com/  
Have some filters from an old astrronomy class for my telescope; i recommend anyone that can get some, do.  When you can look through a telescope at it, the sun ia more than a big ball of fire, shits dynamic.
Here's a image of the sun and any current spots facing us as of this post: http://www.spaceweather.com/images2017/04sep17/hmi1898.gif?PHPSESSID=ipgev0ckg9oao7niv11frs35h7 And you can get more info about the current sun, atmospheric, and arora info from spaceweather.com, http://www.spaceweather.com/
Sweet!
Im more interested in the fact that my eclipse glasses now have more than one use
Well yeah, they're made for staring at the sun.    The real danger with eclipses isn't looking at the sun during a total eclipse, it's looking at it when it *isn't* totally eclipsed. So the glasses give you the ability to look at the sun without damaging your eyes while you watch the whole process.
I've seen elsewhere that this could be a sign of serious electro-magnetic radiation, intense enough to cause serious problems. Is this true? 
"Better than glasses, which have some risk of degradation or scratching that will let damaging light through, [build yourself a solar projector.] (https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/diy-solar-viewer)  A solar projector will project an image of the Sun onto a white screen, and you can see the sunspots very clearly and distinctly.  The easiest way to do it is to get a cheap child's telescope from the thrift store and mount it to a board such that it points the eyepiece at a piece of white plastic mounted on the end of the board.  It helps to cut a hole in the middle of a pizza box top, and to put that around the objective (big) lens end of the telescope to create a shady area for the screen.  Point the telescope at the Sun, and voila! you can see the Sun on a screen without looking directly at it.  If you cut a ring from a PVC pipe and mount it on a 12"" stick at one end of the board, and mount a skinny 12"" stick (piece of bamboo tomato stake) in line with it at the other end of the board, you can adjust the height of the skinny stick so that it works like a gunsight.  Point the viewer toward the Sun and watch its shadow on the ground.  You will also see the shadow of the ring and the skinny stick.  When the shadow of the tip of the skinny stick is centered in the shadow of the ring, the Sun will be projected onto your screen.  It takes a little adjustment, but its easy to aim the viewer once you get it aligned.  A good source of white plastic for the screen is a piece cut from the side of a plastic kitty litter jug.  White posterboard or foamboard will also work well.  The distance between the eyepiece and the screen will determine how big a picture you see of the Sun.  If you have the screen close up, you will have a very small image that is very bright, too small and too bright to look at comfortably.  If you move the screen back some, you can get an image of the Sun that is about 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and the sunspots will be easy to see very clearly, while the image will be bright, but not bright enough to make it hard to look at comfortably.  The good thing about the shadow gunsight is that you are always aiming by looking at the ground, instead of peeking over your shoulder to try to find the Sun's location."
"Sunspots and flares can cause issues on Earth, yes.  In fact, a massive solar storm is blamed for causing surges in lines around the Midwest in.... 1850s? That caused telegraph wires to spark and spontaneously arc.  I'll try to dig up more in a sec here.   Edit: Google up ""Solar Storm of 1859"". Wikipedia has a decent article.

What would happen if a surge of that magnitude happened today?
"It can be really really bad.   > A June, 2010 report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), in conjunction with the Department of Energy, warned that ""Geomagnetic storms... not only can develop rapidly but also have continental footprints that can result in widespread, simultaneous impact to many points on the system. The system is not designed to operate through the simultaneous loss of many key assets.... "" Power grids around the world rely on extra-high voltage (EHV) custom-built transformers for power transmission. In an extreme geomagnetic storm, the 2010 NERC report estimates-based on the scenario in Figure 9- that ~350 EHV transformers in the United States ""will exceed levels where the transformer is at risk of irreparable damage,"" collapsing large portions of the power grid. ""These multi-ton apparatus generally cannot be repaired in the field, and if damaged in this manner, they need to be replaced with new units, which have manufacture lead times of 12 months or more"" (National Academy of Sciences, 2008). Full recovery could take 4-10 years (National Academy of Sciences, 2008) [source](http://www.governmentattic.org/24docs/UnpubFEMAgeomagRpts_2010.pdf)  What happens when millions of people lose power, telecom, banking and finance, petroleum and natural gas, transportation, food, water, and emergency services for a year? Let's come back to that.   First let's consider that [according to a commission set up by the House Armed Services Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Baker-Statement-5-13-EMP.pdf), the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) which I mentioned above generally downplays the threat:  > The standards ultimately developed by NERC include a set of operational procedures requiring no physical protection of the electric grid and a scientifically-flawed benchmark GMD threat description that enables most U.S. utilities to avert installing physical protection based on their own paper modeling studies. The benchmark GMD threat description is based on solar storm statistics over the last 25 years during which there were no ‚ÄúCarrington Class‚Äù 100-year solar superstorms. The Carrington-class storm GMD levels are an order of magnitude higher than the largest storms in the NERC 25 year data window. NERC‚Äôs benchmark event is admissible only if we assume that all eleven-year solar cycles are the same, an assumption known to be incorrect. A skeptic might suspect that the NERC standard‚Äôs main objective was to avert liability rather than protect the public from serious GMD consequences.  Okay then, maybe we can shut down the grid at the first sign of trouble to prevent damage?  > The 15-45 minute warning time earlier provided by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite and now supported by the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) successor will be inadequate for grid operators to confer while executing required operational procedures. Participants in the 2011 National Defense University-Johns Hopkins University GMD response exercise indicated that they would be hard-pressed even to get all the players to the table within such a short time interval. And, once hit, the grid would fail quickly. We note that, in 1989, during a moderate solar storm GMD, the electric power grid of the entire Province of Quebec went dark in 92 seconds. The August 2003 Northeast Blackout evolved much more slowly (1:31pm ‚Äì 4:10pm) with much more time available to take action. Nonetheless, even with a span of hours available, power companies were unable to react fast enough to prevent grid collapse.  > Grid operators will not have adequate information on the state of the grid to implement correct operational procedures. Because most of the grid is not monitored for Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GIC), operators will be ‚Äúflying blind‚Äù with respect to the state of the grid. Operators will not know which portions need remedial action and what actions will be optimal. Information gaps will exist as in August 2003 ‚Äì where operators were unaware of the initiating tree contact. Sensors needed to monitor GMD/EMP stressors on critical grid components were not required by NERC standards and have not been installed. And this lack of visibility has led and will lead to errors in executing operational procedures.  > There is no control center with large enough visibility to control operational procedure response on a national scale. Lack of information on neighboring interconnections impairs proper procedural response. A national control/coordination center does not exist. And in the Eastern Interconnection, there is no single authority over the nine American regional Reliability Coordinators. Because the geographic coverage of solar storm GMD and nuclear EMP can be continental in scale, sup-regional control visibility and authority are necessary. At this point, only the federal government, using Presidential authority, can fulfill this role.   > Operational procedures have not been adequate to address the much simpler causes of previous large-scale blackouts. For instance, operational procedures proved ineffective in preventing the 2003 Northeast blackout that was precipitated by a single failure point ‚Äì tree contact with a transmission line. Recent grid models indicate that GMD and EMP will cause hundreds to thousands of failure points. The complexity and rapidity of grid failure during a Carrington-class event will overwhelm the ability of electric utilities to respond and to prevent grid failure using any suite of operational procedures, no matter how well- conceived and practiced. During Hurricane Sandy, grid physical damage outstripped the effectiveness of procedural protection efforts. Physical damage to grid components will be a factor in GMD/EMP events as well.  > Unforeseen grid equipment malfunctions have greatly impaired grid operators‚Äô ability to respond during major blackouts in the past. Operational procedures during the 2003 Northeast blackout were greatly impaired by computer control system malfunctions and software problems. Critical grid state monitoring, logging and alarm equipment failed. The control area‚Äôs SCADA and emergency management systems malfunctioned. The shut-down of hundreds of generators over multiple states was unanticipated as was the failure of tens of transmission lines. Confusion and inoperative control systems led to many frantic phone calls. As these events, show, any early failure of major grid components caused by the GMD or EMP environment will impede implementation of subsequent operational procedures.  Great.  Okay well maybe these sorts of huge solar storms don't happen very often. But we know about [a big one that happened in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_2012). It missed the Earth by about 9 days, as the Sun rotates around its own axis with a period of about 25 days. The only reason we know about it is because it happened to hit one of our sun-observing [spacecraft](https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/where/where_is_stereo.gif). So it's really just a matter of time.   Okay, so we can live for a while if the power goes out right? Obviously so. But only for a while. Our modern economy and food delivery systems rely on power and communications.   > ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs briefly dealt with in the commission report [of 2008]. There are essentially two estimates on how many people would die from hunger, from starvation, from lack of water, and from social disruption. One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90% of the U.S. population would die. We‚Äôre talking about total devastation. We‚Äôre not talking about just a regular catastrophe.‚Äù  I couldn't find that in the report myself but I did find, ""An EMP attack could, in effect, temporarily create in the United States the technological conditions in the food and transportation infrastructures that have resulted in developing world famines."" and ""The human consequences of such a scenario include the social and psychological reactions to a sudden loss of stability in the modern infrastructure over a large area of the country. """
>One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die.  Wow... Shouldn't someone be working on a way to remedy this?
It can take down large parts of the electrical grid, as it did in 1989.  https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/sun_darkness.html  It disrupts radio communication, which affects things like cell signals and other telecommuncations.   
They did. After 9/11, the EMP commission was formed to assess the threat and make suggestions on how to mitigate its risks. http://www.empcommission.org/. I would suggest contacting your congressman and seeking info on if the commissions recommendations are being implemented.
"You mean ""micro gravity"" as ""anti-gravity"" is more of a science fiction term ([micro-gravity is NASA's term](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-microgravity-58.html) about living and working in/on spacecraft). Or more likely just ""weightlessness"".  Female astronauts have the option of carrying their preferred pads or tampons while in space ([Popular Science 2016](http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space)). If they choose to not get their periods they can medically induce amenorrhea, or stop their periods from happening ([The Atlantic 2016](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/04/menstruating-in-space/479229/)). There was [a scientific paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav20168) written on medically induced amenorrhea in female astronauts in 2016.   There are several ways to induce amenorrhea, through hormonal pills, injections or intrauterine device (IUDs). While it is safe to have your period in space, it may not be all that convenient to switch pads or tampons and deal with disposal. The water treatment is also set up to recycle water from urine, but not menstrual blood so that is also an issue ([American Chemical Society 2014](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2014/acs-presspac-april-9-2014/recycling-astronaut-urine-for-energy-and-drinking-water.html)).  According to National Geographic (link below) if a woman spent three years in space she would need about 1,100 pills, which adds some weight to a mission but is less unwieldy than many tampons. Alternatively, three years worth of tampons (or pads) still weighs more than three years worth of pills.  Female astronauts' periods have a long history. National Geographic has a great opening paragraph in one of [their articles](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/22/how-do-women-deal-with-having-a-period-in-space/) on the subject:  >Sally Ride‚Äôs tampons might be the most-discussed tampons in the world. Before Ride became the first American woman in space, scientists pondered her tampons, weighed them, and NASA‚Äôs professional sniffer smelled them‚Äîbetter to take deodorized or non-deodorized?‚Äîto make sure they wouldn‚Äôt smell too strongly in a confined space capsule. Engineers considered exactly how many she might need for a week in space. (Is 100 the right number?, they famously asked her. No, Ride said. That is not the right number.)"
I think what you were getting at is how does the blood come out without gravity? Because in that case it actually doesn't require gravity, the muscles in the uterus push it out sufficiently enough that it's unnecessary to worry about, but the comments about how you would deal with it are all correct and quite frankly hilarious on the scientists part. As a physicist who is a part of mission planning it's obvious that none of the men (who make of 90% of the field) would have any idea how to deal with such an issue.   Edit: source! This article mentions how the uterus does the work. http://www.today.com/health/do-you-get-your-period-space-why-microgravity-menstruation-matters-t87711
Are astronauts required to have appendicectomies and cholecystectomies prior to their mission? If so, what about endometrial ablation? Given the radiation in space, have any female astronauts gone on to have kids? If so, have they turned out 'normal'?
Addendum: Now that I am at my computer, I can source/edit the post for those interested.  The three predominant modalities previously used were depot medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera), danazol, or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) in suppression-dosing fashion (RT Jennings & ES Baker's chapter from Principles of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight by Barratt 1st Ed 2008). Suppression dosing means that they would skip the placebo week and restart a new pack every three weeks to cause amenorrhea. The most common choice was OCPs which would make since given the more abnormal bleeding patterns we may see initially with Depo and the fear of bone mineral density effects that both space and Depo could play (Knunitz 2009). Though it must be noted, that OCPs were not without risk either. Depot medroxyprogesterone is a progesterone-only contaceptive; the most common OCPs contain estrogen and progesterone. Exogenous estrogen may increase the risk for venous thromboembolism given female astronauts now meet Virchow's Triad of hypercoaguability caused by the estrogen, stasis in space, and trauma that occurs. Dr. Varsha Jain at Kings College London is an expert on this and has a freely-available lecture online [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150001648.pdf).   As others have mentioned, the ISS can recycle urine, but not blood and thus not having any bleeding was strongly desired. If women were done with childbearing, they sometimes would perform an endometrial ablation to prevent bleeding. This was preferred over a hysterectomy because they would prefer not to create adhesions in the abdomen and put astronauts at risk for bowel obstruction etc while in space. This is again discussed in the chapter by Jennings linked above. Currently, Mirena IUDs are preferred. This is more appropriate modality in that it can cause amenorrhea, decrease risk of endometrial cancer, act as highly-effective birth control, and decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) by not giving exogenous estrogen.   Edit 2: I would have loved to answer more of the questions on here or respond with valid peer-reviewed sources, however, Mods locked the thread. Feel free to ask other questions as well if you would like. I am an OBGYN with a strong interest in space medicine. Sorry for the delay in editing/providing sources. 
"The thing with NASA is that EVERYTHING is overengineered for the absolute worst case scenario on purpose since you can't just pop off to the store if you happen to run out. They probably thought ""What's the average amount of pads used per day? 3-6? Ok lets say 8 to be safe. How many days will the period last for? 2-7? Ok lets say 10 to be safe."" That gives you 80 per week right there, plus NEVER having experience a period in space, there was no way to plan for what might happen."
> According to National Geographic (link below) if a woman spent three years in space she would need about 1,100 pills, which adds some weight to a mission but is less unwieldy than many tampons.  Compared to [800 g of food](https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html) per day, a pill per day should be tolerable.
Thank you for someone actually answering the question. Yeah it helps to know they can stop their periods,  but you finally came in and told us that periods work the same without gravity.
No, astronauts are not required to have appendectomies, much less cholecystectomies (which are quite a bit riskier).  And the radiation exposure in space is about 10-20 times higher than on Earth. So spending, say, six months on ISS is like spending 5-10 years on Earth. Do you know any women who spent 5-10 years on Earth and went on to have normal children?
>Are astronauts required to have appendicectomies and cholecystectomies prior to their mission? If so, what about endometrial ablation? Given the radiation in space, have any female astronauts gone on to have kids? If so, have they turned out 'normal'?   NASA absolutely does not surgically alter their astronauts. As for radiation, both men and women in the Corps are advised to avoid pregnancy for up to one year after living aboard the Space Station, in part, due to radiation, but also due to the physiological changes that occur in the microgravity environment
Better to be prepared and have too much than too little. They also were uncertain of the medical issues of menstruating and whether or not the uterus would be able to expel the shed lining in zero gravity or if it were possible for the lining to move up into the fallopian tubes (retrograde menstruation) ([Popular Science 2016](http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space)). Luckily for women astronauts, things still work as intended in space. 
> 3-6? Ok lets say 8 to be safe.   >2-7? Ok lets say 10 to be safe.  I wonder if there's a preferred number of standard deviations above the mean for worst-case-scenario planning in general. You want to have enough supplies for outlier situations, but not too many to fit in the available space.   20 standard deviations is probably too many; 1 certainly isn't enough. Would 3 or 4 be a safe, non-excessive number?   
The uterus still contracts to expel the lining. It may take a little longer without gravity, but likely not significantly longer. There is nothing extra astronauts do to stimulate uterine contractions or lining expulsion.
Got news for you...:  Women in comas who lie down for several years or a few decades still have menstruation and their bleeding cycle is actually shorter.
According to Mary Roach's *Packing for Mars* they are allowed (great book!). Not sure on the details, I'll look for other sources.  Astronaut Ron Garan also said as much [in this AMA](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r62jp/iama_nasa_astronaut_that_recently_returned_to/c437nfi/).  The Guardian has a news article on it [here](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/nov/19/theobserver.uknews).
It could be difficult to manipulate a full cup of blood in zero gravity. They're relatively small and very flexible. 
Hm, if only they had Soviet expertise on the matter. Soviets launched two women before US did, first one being Treshkova in 1963, 20 years before Ride. And Savitskaya just a year before Ride.
This is for structural loads but it would be easy to adapt to any system-  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_of_safety
Risk versus benefit analyses. You don't want medical waste floating around  Source: NASA contractor working on Human Research Program who also menstruates
Forgive me if I've misunderstood but it appears you are comparing the weight of 3 years worth of birth control bills to one week's worth of tampons... even if there were lighter tampons it would be orders of magnitudes heavier for a 3year supply.
It was suspected once and the cosmonaut was evacuated. Here is more info: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310768/ 
Tereshkova was in space for about 2 and a half days, and almost certainly didnt have her period while up there, as the capsule was exceedly small and she would have been stuck in a seated position for the whole flight.  It's pretty doubtful the Soviets knew much more, if anything, than the US did on the subject.
Not a lot of expertise to be gained, it still took quite some time before any women were in space for more than a few days.  Don't get me wrong, it's awesome that gender was not such an issue for early cosmonauts, it's just that this did not result in any massive influx in data regarding gender issues in microgravity.
That was my first thought, and then I remembered the US wasn't very keen on asking the Soviets for advice in 1983. You know, mutually assured destruction and all.
In the case of possibly having free floating menstrual blood in the living area, they would absolutely prefer too many over too little especially with the low mass of pads/tampons. A few more grams of hygiene products is not killer.
How did she pee and poop? Did she wear a diaper? That would have taken care of her period too, if any, but it must have smelled awful, and it must have been painful too. Or did she have a catheter? I'm honestly curious. 
You'd be surprised at how much more the Soviet Space program was willing to work with NASA than the rest of the Soviet government and vice versa. Back in 1975 they even docked a Soyuz capsule with a US Apollo command/service module.
Aside from that Soviets only sent women up for a few days, periods were likely not an issue or they were not in space long enough to collect any worthwhile data.
"Yep, it's 1.4 times the *ultimate* load. That's the highest load ever expected to occur in the vehicle.  So it's not 1.4 times your weight on the bike, it's 1.4 times the force of you coming down off a hard jump or something.  Also, we use things referred to as ""knockdown"" factors for a lot of stuff. For instance, you know your materials aren't 100% pure, so you might ""knock down"" the estimated strength by 20%. Or you know that it's hard to calculate buckling loads, so you assume it'll happen at 60% of what your calculations say it will."
It's also more accurate to the point at hand, because not all women menstruate.   (One who has no exciting ties to NASA, though she does menstruate on rare occasions)
I mean, you can't really push your period blood out like you can with urine and feces. If you could, I'd get it over with and done instead of leaking for a week.
Exactly. Treshkova spent 3 days, Savitskaya spent 8 days. You aren't going to collect data on the effects of a space environment on menstruation if you aren't menstruating.
>Yep, it's 1.4 times the *ultimate* load. That's the highest load ever expected to occur in the vehicle.  Well that sounds much more sensible. Those rocket scientists seem pretty smart. 
"ok, ignorant question here- what about on ""heavy flow days"", can you help it along with muscle contractions or anything like that (if you'd even want to do that)? or is it like, heavy flow days it's not any different than light days, just it happens to ""leak"" more frequently, not more voluminously, and ""heavy"" is sort of a misnomer?"
"> You'd be surprised at how much more the Soviet Space program was willing to work with NASA than the rest of the Soviet government and vice versa.  Astronomers in general tend to be 'without borders'.  I remember one guy I talked to, maybe 20-30 years ago now, said ""Ya can't see the whole sky at once, so it's always nice to have friends on the other side of the planet."""
"You've already had this covered well enough, but...  Think of it this way:  I have my vagina.  It's a tunnel a few inches long.  It's the place where the fun happens when sexy times are going on. :)  My cervix is  around the end of this.  The cervix connects  the vagina to the uterus.  The cervix is basically a muscle ring that spends it's whole life clenched tightly.  It's job is to keep stuff--except sperm--out of the womb.  The womb is there the baby making happens.  think of it as a sack, or a balloon or something. It's got space on the inside.  When we have a period, what's basically happening is that the inner layer of the womb is peeling off.  This inner layer has a lot of blood vessels in it, because it's supposed to be ripe delicious ground for a fertilized egg to rest.  So when it starts peeling off, there's a lot of blood and juice and stuff.  So, it's basically an open, weeping wound. Heavy days are when the bleeding is heavier.  Lighter days are when the bleeding is lighter.  There are some actions we can take that can ...  adjust the rate at which blood leaves our body, so to speak.  For example, laying down allows blood to pool, both in the womb and in the vaginal canal.  Blood flow is lessened as a result, however, when you stand up, gravity WILL kick back in.  (for comedy, this can result in, in the morning, laying stone still as one feels that there is a lot of blood inside them....  then the QUICK leap up out of bed, clutching one's crotch and fleeing to bathroom.)  Actions that involve contracting the womb can make more blood come out--as the womb already contracts itself to try and push blood out.  excersize, activity, orgasm and similar can have the same result.  Being still can result in blood pooling inside.  Every womb-owner has experienced, say, going through a class, and feeling fine in regards to if they need to change their tampons, then standing up, and realizing that no, they need to go NOW.  but we can't really effect the heavy/light-ness of our period.  We can't control how bad the wound is bleeding, so to speak.  Typically, you start with light days, then heavy days, then light days again.  so, again, think of it as a water ballon or something, attached to some flexible tubing.  the water's leaking out at a relatively set rate (that may be light, heavy or anything in between) ... and the water finds all sorts of places to go, and changing the orientation of the tubing can result in pooled fluid being released from the ""tide pools"" so to speak."
FYI, uterine muscle is smooth muscle, and is therefore NOT under voluntary control. Fun fact: The same hormones the body uses to trigger uterine contractions to expel the uterine lining also affects OTHER nearby smooth muscle organs. AKA, your intestines. Hence, uterine cramps are almost always accompanied by crampy, painful, loose period shits. It's like goddamn pelvic floor dubstep going on down there sometimes. 
You can't control it. Heavy flow days means more comes out, you can feel the difference, but you can't do anything about it. And there certainly is a difference! Heavy flow days can mean 90 ml of blood. Light days can mean 1-5.
Yes. You can actually! But it may be uncomfortable. It's also a method for (early) abortion, so political right wingers aren't fans of that... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_extraction 
i almost guarantee they did. gotta minimize as many variables as possible.
You should write human anatomy textbooks. Great explanation and description, in plain terms. 
Thanks for this very clear explanation, I understand much better now what my wife goes through. 
"[Dynamo Theory](http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/dynamo_effect.html). Quote:  _""In this dynamo mechanism, fluid motion in the Earth's outer core moves conducting material (liquid iron) across an already existing, weak magnetic field and generates an electric current. The electric current, in turn, produces a magnetic field that also interacts with the fluid motion to create a secondary magnetic field.""_  So, to paraphrase, while the iron itself is not magnetic, it produces an electric current, which generates an electo-magnetic effect."
The reason why the earth generates a magnetic field despite iron losing its magnetism at a temperature much lower than the core is because the molten core, which contains electric charges, rotates and thus produces an electric current which in turn produces the magnetic field.
Superheating any metal will create an electromagnetic field due to the movement of electrons.   Take a massive amount of metal, molten and flowing with heat and pressure, and you get a significant amount of electron movement, and a resulting electromagnetic field.  This is also why the Earth's magnetic field is so inconsistent in terms of flux lines and fluctuates significantly over time.  
What generates the already existing weak magnetic field?
Like a massive generator?
"Assuming I've understood the abstract correctly, then then above link states that -   ""(Heat from radioactive decay in the core is thought to induce the convective motion.) The electric current, in turn, produces a magnetic field that also interacts with the fluid motion to create a secondary magnetic field. Together, the two fields are stronger than the original and lie essentially along the axis of the Earth's rotation."""
That's an interesting idea  So we are living on a big electric generator, fighting over fuel.... 
"But even before the electric current producing the magnetic field that interracts with the fluid motion to create a secondary magnetic field it says this:   >""In this dynamo mechanism, fluid motion in the Earth's outer core moves conducting material (liquid iron) across an already existing, weak magnetic field and generates an electric current.  So the already existing field from how I read that creates the current that you speak of.  Here is the full quote that the original comment already had that has the part you quoted included in it:  >""In this dynamo mechanism, fluid motion in the Earth's outer core moves conducting material (liquid iron) across an **already existing, weak magnetic field and generates an electric current**. **The electric current, in turn, produces a magnetic field that also interacts with the fluid motion to create a secondary magnetic field.""**  So the current you speak of is produced by the field and doesnt produce it. "
...orbiting an even larger electric generator that we already have technology to harness.
It's a self feeding, self-sustaining feedback. You're trying to analyze only one part, but it's a loop from a very complex entanglement of magnetic fields. This is hard to recreate in a lab, but can be done with molten sodium, for example. Anything with a lot of energy can cause charged particles. There is a lot of heat and friction, so this is expected. Since each charge has its own electric field, and it's all moving from thermal activity, a moving charge generates a magnetic field. There's your weak magnetic field. Now the feedback occurs from its self sustaining nature.  Hopefully that makes sense.
I heard they‚Äôre just firing those things into space hoping they come back charged
To understand why not, you have to understand how a battery works. It's not a tank of electrons, exactly. A battery is a chemical reaction between an anode (-), cathode (+), and an electrolyte (or some form of conduit) which facilitates the exchange of electrons.  When you discharge (use) a battery, a chemical reaction is occurring, moving electrons between the two chemicals (anode and cathode). So, don't think of a battery as a vessel which just holds a pile of electricity. It's a specific transfer of energy between two chemicals.  Now, in a rechargeable battery, this reaction can be reversed by applying electricity using a charger. But, again, it's not adding anything, really. It's reversing the chemical reaction which is putting the chemicals back to their original state.  When charging, it takes time for the reaction to reverse and at the same time, heat is created because the electrons are moving back across the conduit they travelled across originally. Electrons moving over a conductor meet resistance which creates heat, no matter which direction. Much like the battery heating up when you use the phone, the battery will heat up while charging for the same reason. If you were to throw a bunch of current at the battery, it could easily cause a thermal issue. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd: pronounced Nye-Cad) batteries had a problem called thermal runaway where the battery, if charged too quickly, the heat generated could induce a self-feeding loop where the battery could heat to a point of ignition or explosion. But that's not an issue with Lead-Acid batteries (like sealed lead acid batteries like in your car, which use a liquid electrolyte, also known as a wet cell [thanks to u/gilescoreywasframed for the correction below]). Also prone are Lithium Ion (LiOn, like in your cell phone) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-PO) batteries (credit to u/incrediboy729 for the correction here), but these usually incorporate circuitry to prevent this situation.  tl;dr - it is dangerous, and modern cell phone chargers and batteries have circuitry to prevent too fast/overcharging which could lead to heat damage or fire.
This is what we're hoping to be able to do with [graphene batteries](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/phys.org/news/2016-07-fast-charging-everlasting-battery-power-graphene.amp)   They are an example of a supercapacitor, a battery able to physically hold onto electrons. You'd be able to plug it in, fill it up and go on with your life in a matter of seconds.  This is very different from our current technologies, all of which use an electrical current to reverse a chemical reaction. As everyone is saying this process necessarily takes a while and is fairly inefficient, hence battery chargers getting hot, heat production=wasted energy. This is essentially the same difference between lightbulb types. Incandescents are very inefficient, so they get very hot, CFLs are fairly efficient so they only get warm and LEDs are very efficient so they barely produce heat at all.
In short - heat.  Cells (because the world is a collection of bodges) have chemistry that creates internal resistances, and that means heat is generated in charging much as passing current through any wire.  Fast chargers (usually rebadges of Qualcomm QuickCharge) negotiate upto 12v charging adjusting the current to reduce heat build up getting out of control.  What you want CAN however be done with supercapacitors - they're basically chemistry-free, and are constantly evolving.  Soon we'll likely be seeing them in cellphones, but they're not ready quite yet.  You can charge them to capacity very quickly.
Thanks for the solid answer
This brings to mind the recent phone/tablet explosions, I wonder if they failed due to the limitations explained above?
Fast chargers use the same electronics as mentioned before to prevent heat build up and overcharging. They are capable of delivering higher doses of amperage but are still limited if the battery says it's getting too hot.  Basically, fast chargers have the *capability* to charge faster, but are still limited by the battery. 
It's not so much that graphene is hard to get, just like diamonds aren't particularly rare. You can get a sample of graphene by taking a piece of tape to some graphite. However just like diamonds, *large*, *pure* samples that are needed to work chemically are difficult to make, and the methods we have aren't currently economical. 
I've read that it was a design flaw with the batteries and their internal structure which led to short circuits. It wasn't a failure of the chargers, but rather the batteries themselves and either a quality control problem with the supplier or just a flat out flaw in the design.  Edit: I found [this](https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-return-exchange-faq/) which not only explains why the batteries were failing but also has a pretty nice diagram of the internal structure of a LiOn battery.  
This was the same reason why the note 7 explosions happened. I was actually pretty bummed when I had to give mine back. But essentially, there is a barrier between the cathode and anode. In order to cram more juice into the battery the manufacturer reduces the barrier between them. If the barrier is damaged, the electrons can flow freely between the cathode and anode causing a short circuit. This in turn creates an insane amount of heat destroying the barrier, and causing a more intense short circuit. The energy released by this takes on the form of an explosion. 
It wasn't just that, but Samsung engineered out the space around the battery that it needed to use to expand as all batteries do a bit. That force on the battery caused the two electrodes to contact and short-circuited the batteries.
Electricity is run on an alternating current (AC) which reverses voltage in the pattern of a sine wave. In the US, the frequency of this alternating is 60 Hz, which is a B flat (more of a flat B or sharp B flat, really). Sometimes interactions with surroundings, especially at high voltages like in transformers, can cause a hum at the frequency the grid is run on. In most of Europe, as an example, it's run at 50 Hz not 60 Hz, so you would hear a G (a little sharp) instead of a B flat.
In the US, alternating current (AC) oscillates at 60Hz and the buzzing you hear is generated by the second harmonic, so 120Hz. The nearest B-flat is at 116.54Hz, so it's pretty close! The next B is at 123.47Hz, so really you're hearing something that is very much in the middle of B and B-flat. If you were in Europe, where the standard is 50Hz, you'd be hearing something between G (98Hz) and G-sharp (103.83Hz).  Also, excellent ear, are you a musician?
"A lot of answers here are ""electricity is produced at 60Hz in the united states""  but none of them are answering why this is the case,  the frequency of AC mains power is selected to give Synchronous motors attached to grid power directly good operating characteristics. that is, stuff like vacuum cleaners, washing machines, fans for air systems etc.  These are most electric motors that plug into the wall that don't have a special power distribution mechanism built in, those that do have this kind of frequency controller hardware are called Variable Frequency Drives and are often used where the speed of the drive needs to vary rapidly.  VFDs are limited to industrial use for the most part.  *****  The reason the frequency matters for Synchronous motors has to do with the physical design of alternating current motors and the geometry, but the simple explanation is that for simple synchronous motors the speed of the motor in RPMs is dependent on the supplied frequency because the physical rotation of the motor is being driven by the rotation of a magnetic field and the magnetic field is going to rotate at the frequency of the alternating current in AC Synchronous motors.  If we imagine the motor in its most simple state as a set of magnets with a single North and South pole on the rotating part of the motor (the rotor) and a single North and South pole on the stationary part of the motor (the stator).    Our AC mains power drives the Stator magnets, and the magnets on the rotor is a fixed magnet, the rotor spins in normal operation as the poles on the stator switch positions, and the permanent magnet moves to correct its alignment.  With only one set of poles, the rotor speed will match the mains power speed, making one full rotation for each full cycle of switch in polarity.  In real motors the speed will be some multiple of the frequency because multiple poles are used as they provide better torque.  because of this 60 Hz in the US, and 50 Hz is Europe was selected because it allows motor designers to easily build motors that will operate at safe speeds and torques when connected to mains power.  EDIT: added information about how poles work in a motor "
"Good answer! To expand on this, in the industry we call it ""60 cycle hum"":  Electrical current flow creates a magnetic field, and transformers have cores made of ferrous metal.  So the changing alternating-current is causing the big metal cores to move a little bit in a way that matches the rate at which the current changes.  The fundamental frequency is 60Hz like our power frequency, but because of a phenomenon called [""magnetostriction""](http://tdvib.com/magnetostriction/) the transformer iron vibrates at twice that rate, or 120Hz.  If an electrical load on a piece of equipment screws up that normal 60Hz current we can absolutely hear it:  Transformers that have a ton of current harmonics no longer produce a nice ""60 cycle hum"", but can have a much louder, sharper buzz that sounds very noticeably different."
>In most of Europe, as an example, it's run at 50 Hz not 60 Hz,   It's not most of Europe that uses 50Hz, it's most of the world. 60Hz is [used by most of the Americas, half of Japan and Saudi](http://photo.vanderkolk.info/images/utility-frequency.jpg)
I was curious and looked into it. B flat is 58.27 Hz,1.73 away from 60 and B is 61.74 Hz, 1.74 away. 60 is pretty much dead set between the two. It must be differences in individual hearing that discerns a sharp B flat or a flat B. 
"> Also, excellent ear, are you a musician?  I discovered this phenomenon by turning a tuner pedal on before plugging in my guitar. Always read A#. We had a sound guy over another day and he was complaining about a note my bass player kept hitting; it was rattling the speakers. He said its a Bb. I had also just done a ton of research before buying a gaming monitor and once confused operating frequency for frame rate. So when he said ""Bb,"" I sort of twitched and put all this information together all of a sudden and blurted ""I bet that's about 60Hz."" Sound guy pulled out a device and said ""why do you know that?"" I could've saved a lot of time had I just had perfect pitch like OP. "
Other way around, motors were built to match the electric frequency. 50/60 hertz were selected due to a number of factors including generator design, size of transformers, and flickering lights.
I remember years ago reading that power plants couldn't keep the output exactly at 60Hz (there would always be slight variations) but they were able to keep the average frequency at 60 (by slightly raising and lowering the frequency) which they did so that all the electrical clocks that kept time via the cycles would remain more or less accurate. Do they still bother doing this, now that most clocks use quartz  or internet connectivity to stay accurate?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequency#Time_error_correction_.28TEC.29  According to wikipedia its still done today, but I am 99% sure it isn't. The grid today is kept very close to 60 because the north american networks are huge.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_U.S._power_transmission_grid#/media/File:NERC-map-en.svg  The frequency of the grid is consistent across an interconnection, so any drop in load or pickup of generation can only have a minimal effect on the grid frequency. Variations do occur during large system events, but those are very rare. Frequency isn't shared between interconnections because they are connected through DC lines. 'Island' systems with much smaller load/generation have a much harder time maintaining a conistent 60Hz.
"All hydro, gas, nuclear, and coal plants connected to the grid have governor systems which control the amount of fuel (water, steam, etc) entering the turbine in an attempt to keep the system frequency at 60Hz. If system frequency falls, all generator governors connected to the grid pass more fuel to the turbine to speed it up. The opposite is true for high frequency. A perfect 60Hz AC on the grid requires an exact balance of generation and demand, but since load is varying all the time, frequency is mostly maintained within about 59.98 to 60.02 Hz. Beyond these ranges, if frequency starts to get really bad (like 59.8 to 60.2 Hz), then special protection systems will automatically disconnect loads or generators to return the frequency to normal. Since the Eastern and Western halves of North America are separate synchronous grids (with the exception of Quebec and Texas), every region in each of those grids has to be perfectly balanced to maintain frequency. If the grid as a whole has been under or over generated for a significant amount of time, it produces ""time error"", the slowing or speeding of a clock which runs on the 60Hz mains frequency compared to a reference clock. In the Eastern interconnect, time error is measured and recorded by one system operator designated the Time Monitor. Once time error exceeds 10 seconds positive or negative, all system operators in the interconnect participate in a ""time error correction"", in which they change their scheduled system frequency to 59.98 or 60.02Hz. This causes their automatic generation control systems (fast moving regulation for small changes in demand without requiring redispatch of the whole generation fleet) to trend generation slightly high or low for a time, reversing the time error until it reaches around 0 seconds again. If you look for time error correction on NERC's website, it dives into a lot of detail. Whether or not this is still necessary, I don't really know, but time error correction is definitely still done. "
The reason it's only half of Japan is because in the 19th century, western Japan imported its generating equipment from Germany (50Hz) while eastern Japan imported equipment from the U.S. (60Hz), and by the time the whole country was electrified, it would have been vastly too expensive and a massive pain in the ass to unify the two separate grids. Nowadays it only comes up in odd situations (like when Fukushima knocked out a chunk of the east's generating capacity) because virtually all consumer electrical goods are compatible with both 50Hz and 60Hz. (There are also three converting stations but their capacity isn't huge.)
I dispatch the electric grid for a living. We absolutely still do time error corrections.   It's impossible to keep the grid at exactly 60Hz forever. Even if it's slow by .001Hz, it will need correcting eventually.   The actual frequency is constantly changing due to load changes. 
The frequency is directly linked to the mechanical rotation of the turbine. Less demand means less load, which means the turbine can spin faster.
Former zookeeper here: I‚Äôve only personally worked with lesser apes, but from my observations they either squat to use their urine to scent mark, or just pee from their perch. No hands involved. Ring tailed lemurs (not an ape, but a tangentially related fun fact) will pee on their tails, then flick the scent at each other.   The rest of the great apes have much much smaller penis to body size ratios than humans do. Gorillas are only about the size of your pinky. Also unlike humans, most apes have a penis bone, which means their flaccid penis is much less ‚Äúfloppy.‚Äù So humans have a much different penis anatomy than other apes, which could lead to the behavioral difference of holding it while you pee.
Human male penis size relative to body size is VASTLY greater than other apes (and almost every other mammal). This is likely due to a number of reasons, although it‚Äôs important to understand that physical evolutionary traits are not being governed by some conscious force trying to get optimal results, so it could just be a random genetic mutational accident that we have since compensated for (as long as it doesn‚Äôt seriously inhibit reproduction then a trot won‚Äôt be selected against).  First, is that we have a very low degree of sexual dimorphism compared to other apes (and many mammals in general). A male gorilla with a penis the same proportions as their body compared to humans would potentially cause a lot of pain from ripping and tearing the relatively much smaller female gorillas, for example (especially considering they don‚Äôt generally give the female any time to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù and get the natural lubricant flowing).  Second, female sexual pleasure is an important part of human mating, and encourages more frequent reproduction opportunities compared to animals that don‚Äôt have this trait. Other traits that contribute to this effect in humans are frequent menstrual cycles concealed estrus. Instead of a yearly period of ‚Äúheat,‚Äù human females are available for insemination at regular, frequent intervals. It‚Äôs apparent in other species when the female is fertile, but human females do not exhibit engorged and discolored labia, nor do they exhibit strong pheromones during their period of receptivity to being impregnated. All of this contributes to increased mating opportunities. It also contributes to a confusion about paternal parentage, which seriously reduces the amount of babies killed by dominant males that only want females to spend their time and energy caring for their children (since any of the kids given birth to by a female they have mated with could be theirs), which would otherwise be common, and is still frequently seen when males from outside a group take over that group (they can safely kill all the kids because they definitely aren‚Äôt theirs). But that‚Äôs not relevant to the current discussion; I just wanted to point out how these things aren‚Äôt only related to the same root causes as increased penis size, and how they may not really be related to penis size at all. Some of these factors are also present in other primates, not just us.  Third is the phenomenon of a sperm arms race, due to the aforementioned incentive for frequent copulation of females with multiple males in the same general time period. When multiple males inseminate a female around the same time, the one that gets their sperm the furthest in has a better chance. Ejaculation velocity and sperm ‚Äúswimming‚Äù speed are also important, but sperm can be relatively slow to get going through the first parts of the vagina, so those things being equal, a longer penis equals enhanced reproductive capabilities. Gorillas, for example, typically only have one male attempting copulation within their harem at any one time, so there is no need for sperm competition.  If you look outside apes to other primates, there are a bunch of monkeys that have similar penis ratios, likely for similar reasons, so we‚Äôre not exclusive with this particular trait. We do have very small testicles relative to our body weight, compared with other apes, but I haven‚Äôt studied the reasons for this as much so I‚Äôll just leave it at that, except to say that chimpanzees probably have even more sperm competition than humans ever did, but they don‚Äôt have larger penises, and that‚Äôs probably because their testes are over 33% the size of their brains, while ours are a paltry 3%. This is because their solution to this sperm competition is to use their massive testicles to copulate with females many times a day, every day, whereas if humans attempt this, their sperm count drops drastically after only two ejaculations a day.  There are a variety of other factors to consider, such as our tendency towards monogamy and how it clashes with some of these other theories. We could have moved closer to monogamy relatively recently, but conflicting with that is the fact that Humans have remarkably smooth penises, which is generally found in monogamous species. Polygynous species usually have odd proportions such as huge heads that act as a plug, or bumps and ridges and extreme curvatures, etc. Human males also are quite a bit bigger than females, just not as much as some other species.  Edit: I meant to respond to the other comment about this, not the main post.
Chimpanzees caregiver here, I have never seen any use their hand to pee. Most of the time they just pee off a ledge.  I have seen one pee into a bottle before but he didn‚Äôt use his hands he just brought the bottle to the stream.
Follow-up questions: When did we start doing that? Since we designated holes to piss in, or before? I mean I would suspect the only way to have any idea would be from a well-preserved, old-ass cave painting of a dude draining his pisser lizard, right? Would that have been a thing back then? Like, early piss porn or something?
You are just the person to answer my loosely related question...do other primates mark off a separate place for waste? I was thinking the other day I‚Äôve never seen a primate use the bathroom. At the zoo or on tv. Are they private about it?
Also, more fascinatingly, humans are the only animal whose movement leads with the genitals. Normal standing posture has the penis protruding way out in front. Most animal males walk and stand with the penis tucked under the body and between the legs for protection.
Many animals in captivity often limit defecation to a particular part of their enclosure like a corner or somewhere they feel safe. Animals are often like us in that they try to avoid defecating in places they eat and sleep (really depending on the animal) so you might not see them doing this in their main living area.
Yes! Look up [animal latrines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_latrine). These are often great places to set up a wildlife camera for the frequency of sightings.
Which honestly seems like a design flaw to me. Why are my most sensitive bits front and center and not so easy to defend?
I read this recently!  So my impression of her work was that it *was* a great analysis of how androcentrism has colored work on female sexuality, *but* I think she went to great lengths to convince herself and her reader that the female orgasm is a developmental byproduct of the male orgasm that happens to be fun.  A fun accident, as it were.    The thing is, though, she seems to ignore the idea that *even if* the female orgasm is just the developmental byproduct of the male orgasm, pleasure from the female side *could have* put positive pressure on the ‚Äòhappy orgasm‚Äô trait in general.  Her work is better viewed as a lesson in biases, personally.
He had just finished drinking from the bottle and started peeing.  Then he looked at the bottle put it to the stream filled it half way, smelled it and then left it and he wandered off.
Surprised this article didn't mention ants! They have dedicated dumps in their anthills!
Primatologist here. I worked with Spider Monkeys in Belize and we observed areas under trees where there was a large amount of fecal buildup. It wasn‚Äôt clear if these were actual latrines or if these areas just coincided with preferred sleeping spots. We noted every time one of these spots were utilized and it was pretty rare that they were used outside of sleeping times. They did forage in these areas during the day and they did not exclusively use the ‚Äúlatrine‚Äù areas to go to the bathroom.   The only primates that have had latrine behaviour documented are lemurs. Remember that lemurs are actually fairly separated on the evolutionary chain from New World and Old World primates and tend to have more primitive characteristics. Thus, this behaviour may be a primitive hold out.   Source: https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/85/3/420/900401
It isn't a design flaw, because it isn't by design. Evolution doesn't plan ahead. We started like every other primate, genitals tucked under and intercourse from behind; missionary position isn't something you see a lot outside humans.  When some mutation made us start to stand more erect, we were not designed for it (hips, pelvis, etc.); but it was so advantageous it overcame the negative points that came with it. Being able to sprint is such a big evolutionary deal we can deal with childbirth and intercourse not working the way it had for millions of years. Some stuff is cramped, some stuff is out of place, but whatever.  Don't think 'someone screwed up their design'; think 'when something better came along, the other parts of us had to deal with it best they could'.
I've seen the video you referenced and I tend to agree with that theory. The action of cervix rhythmically dipping into the semen pool during orgasm - *to me* - seems to strongly suggest that that motion coupled with strong euphoric orgasm greatly promotes the odds and paths of sperm reaching the fallopian tubes as well as encouraging further copulation due to the pleasure, further improving odds, as well as bonding.
It‚Äôs not sprinting that is the advantage with standing, it‚Äôs distance running and added range of sight, which are both key to hunting on the plains of Africa. Chimps are actually much faster sprinters than humans.
There is serious doubt that the plains of Africa had any role to play in early human evolution. It absolutely happened in Africa but those places probably were NOT grassy plains when our ancestors lived there. Pollen fossils at the cradle of humankind site for example suggest that at the time those early humans lived there it was a forrested swampland.  Natural climate change later dried it up but back then it looked very different.  The great ape of the plains is probably a myth. The great ape of the swampy forests more like.
It‚Äôs like we only started walking like that when we realized our dicks were bigger than the other monkeys..
It depends a lot on the insect in question.  The most extreme example I can think of is the [honeypot ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant). Some members of these colonies become living food storage for the rest, hanging in place and taking in or giving out their stored reserves as needed. 
Bloodsucking insects will become engorged after feeding. Mosquitos, bed bugs, lice, ticks, fleas, ticks (arachnid), are visibly larger after feeding.  Perhaps more relevant is the Fat Body.  Insects have an organ called the Fat Body. Lipids (fats) are stored here in adipocytes in the form of triglycerides (same way mammals store fat, essentially). These lipids are consumed during periods of high energy demand (like when flying), and are replenished in periods of food abundance.   Some insects have been shown to increase the size of the Fat Body in the winter, as a mechanism to enhance survival. Other insects (like house flies) don't seem to be able to store extra fat.   edited to add some sources:   Study on fat storage in Culex pipiens: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2769712/  review paper on the insect Fat Body:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075550/
Many insects have a part of their lifecycle dedicated to collecting and storing energy and another part where they can't collect energy, and can only live off of their stored reserves. Lots of species of moth spend their larval stage eating, then form a cocoon and emerge as an adult without a digestive system at all. Their adult stage is dedicated to mating and laying eggs, which will hatch into larvae and repeat the cycle.
Years ago, National Geographic ran an article about the culture of edible insects. Apparently honeypot ants also make a tasty treat for people if you bite off the abdomen.
Wow, that sounds like something straight out of the Zerg from starcraft.
Actually, that white in cockroach is probably not fat. Cockroaches lack haemoglobin which is critical in making blood look red in all animals. Because of lack oh this,cockroach actually has its blood white. So what you referring to is, actually its blood. 
When they burn that fat, what fills the void that's created?
Do you know if there's any sort of mechanism that bloodsuckers have that tells them when to stop feeding? I ask because a while back I was bitten by a mosquito that fattened itself to the point that it was unable to fly (it would comically hover up to about an inch high before falling back down), which made it a lot easier for me to smash it. Obviously, that's a bad spot to put itself into. I'd assume they know to stop before they pop themselves, but it seemed like the one that bit me took it too far. 
What form is the energy stored as?  Is it fat?  A sugary liquid like honey? Something else?
Ants are amazing! Some  have dedicated warrior castes - huge ants with mouths that only work for killing - their sisters need to chew their food for them. Some tend to fungus gardens and herd domesticated caterpillars. They live in huge underground cities. They weave colonies in the tree leaves. They shoot acid. And of course, they go to war with, and enslave, other ant colonies.  Like the Zerg indeed!!!!
Oh yeah, when another ant colony invades a nest of honey pots, things get ugly.  They have a tendency to just cut apart the the repletes and haul back the swollen abdomen like comic book vikings with a big barrel of ale.
How do they transport oxygen without it? 
It's not a void. The fat cells expand with fat, and shrink with less fat. The exoskeleton keeps hugging the fat cells. 
"Some blood feeding insects (ex. mosquitoes, phlebotomine sandflies to name a few) undergo a process known as prediuresis,  in which they excrete urine as they feed in order to concentrate the blood protein (the nutrient rich part which they need) and filter our the ""junk"" (ex. water, parts of the blood that are not needed). This reduces their weight & allows them (most of the time) to fly off after they have finished feeding. This allows them to retain all the nutrients they need, while maintaining a weight which allows them to fly. If you let a mosquito feed for a couple of minutes, you'll see a bunch of liquid droplets fall! It's pretty interesting, but don't try that at home - I did it in a lab where the mosquitoes were bred & they were not carrying any pathogens.  To answer the question you've asked, there is a mechanism that tells them when to stop, but I don't know exactly how it works. Hopefully someone who knows something about that can comment!  Edit: grammar, spelling."
We have them in Australia. It's a sugar of some sort. Tastes a lot like honey. 
When we're able to grow ants with abdomens the size of melons I will be terrified of them escaping.
"Insects don't have blood exactly like ours, but theirs does some of the same jobs, transporting things throughout their bodies.Their blood moves nutrients, waste products, and hormones. They have a heart, but it is near their backs instead of near their front like ours. While our blood stays in tubes all the time, some of their blood squishes around in an open space called the hemocoel (""blood space"").  Instead of using blood to move oxygen and carbon dioxide, their air tubes (which are spread around their bodies) take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. Blood can be different colors. Our blood is red due to hemoglobin, the stuff in our red blood cells that lets us move oxygen and carbon dioxide. Since insects don't move these gases in their blood, their blood doesn't have hemoglobin and is generally not red."
A lot of organisms that are very small don't need oxygen carriers (hemoglobin) to meet their metabolic demands. They can survive just with the diffusion of oxygen into their system from the atmosphere.
Does the exoskeleton expand and shrink as well? Or is there some sort of matrix between the fat cells?
I wouldn't necessarily say that an ant colony is a single organism, but colony insects certainly evolve as though they were a single organism. When only one member of the population reproduces, evolution proceeds quite differently. Most creatures evolve according to what is best for individual survival and reproduction, but ants have no evolutionary pressure to preserve the individual - a population's ability to procreate is affected only by the survival of the queen. A queen whose offspring behaved to maximize their own survival will not do as well as a queen whose offspring are expendable. Worker ants do not have the same kind of self preservation instinct that mammals do, because their evolution is guided by what is most effective at feeding and protecting the queen rather than natural selection pressuring for individual survival. A queen ant's survival strategy is essentially to have a zillion non-fertile babies who will take care of its every need and do not have offspring of their own. Because worker insects do not reproduce on their own, they evolve to benefit their queen instead of to benefit themselves. The whole colony's evolutionary path is determined by the well-being of a single organism.   Ants, bees, and other colony insects are called eusocial animals, which means that they have evolved to prioritize the good of the population as a whole rather than the good of the individual.
It's like a single organism in that the individual ants are similar to cells in a body, different types specialized for specific roles in order to make sure the colony itself prospers. 
Which is why insect size has shrunk proportionally to the reduction of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere over time.  
"I study infectious diseases, including parasites of aquatic insects. One parasite I study is a nematode that infects the aquatic larvae of mayflies. Toward the end of summer, when the nematode and mayfly life cycles are about to move to their next stage, the mayfly may have nothing left inside its exoskeleton except brain and worm. The worm at this point has stolen pretty much all possible nutrients from the mayfly without killing it, and usually takes up most of the body cavity, but the places that are not full of worm are often just hollow. I can't even see guts, let alone fat stores, under the microscope. In unparasitized mayflies, the ""abdomen"", or rear third, of the insect is mostly filled with white stuff that doesn't look unlike cotton stuffing (fat stores), plus a small tube of intestine down the center. There are also some kidney like organs that excrete dissolved waste, but they are really small.  I do not know if the worm consumes the fat stores directly, or if it siphons off energy some other way, but if you imagine a hollow exoskeleton that is what you would see. If you dissect the worm out (as I have done way too many times), you are usually left with a hollow insect, especially if the worm is far along.  I also study Tobacco Hornworms and their parasitic wasps. In the caterpillars, the fat is stored as white blobs that kind of looks like clots or something, between the skin and guts. When they are parasitized, the wasp larvae live between the skin and guts and the clots are absent. Again, I don't know if the cells are completely gone, or just empty and shrunk tinier than I can see, or what.  EDIT: Too many apostrophes and not enough commas.  EDIT2: Realized I didn't answer the question of if the exo-skeleton expands or not. While there are some soft tissues that allow the exoskeleton (or integument in science speak) to flex and expand/contract, it generally only changes size when an insect molts. When the insides shrink due to dehydration or something (and I imagine with major fat loss) they will start to pull away from the exoskeleton. Honestly though, I'm starting to think we should starve some insects and then cut them open so we really know.  [PICS](https://imgur.com/a/8pZzZ)"
I have a Ph.D. in biology and I still found that absolutely disgusting
"I have no idea, and one of my more ""controversial"" ideas is that the worm is actually performing many of the metabolic jobs that keep the mayfly alive. I do not know how the nematode steals energy and nutrients from the mayfly. I am not sure anyone knows.   >How does the parasite live once it kills the host?  Oh-ho my friend, this is the weirdest part! The mayfly transforms into a flying adult with the worm still inside it. If the mayfly is a male, the worm secretes hormones that ""femenize"" it, and make it look and act like a female. Instead of trying to mate, infected mayflies (male and female) fly back to the water to try and lay eggs. What actually happens is the worm crawls out, the mayfly dies, and then the worm lays *its* eggs.  As far as I know the explanation for why the worm bothers femenizing the males and going through the whole metamorphosis thing is to expand its ability to move from one place to another.  I think you are going to have to dive into the academic literature if you want to learn more. [Here is a good starting point.](http://www.ephemeroptera-galactica.com/pubs/pub_v/pubvances1996p377.pdf)"
