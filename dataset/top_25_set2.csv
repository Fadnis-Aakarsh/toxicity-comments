We just got my wife a newer car, and she said she was going to give this one away. At first, she was going to put it on CL for free, but I said that wasn’t a great idea, because you’d get scrappers or just anyone wanting a free car who didn’t really need it. We decided to list it as $1200, a bit below its value, because anyone looking for a car in that price range probably just really needs a car. We’ve been in that boat not that long ago, and figure we can help someone who needs it more than we need $1200. We are meeting her later today, and I think my wife is going to give her $500 to register it and maybe get new tires (or whatever she wants to use it for).   UPDATE: Wow, this response is overwhelming!  I was hesitant to post this conversation because I thought it would come across as a humble brag. And yes, my wife is amazing. I probably would have just sold the car without giving it much thought. We’re in a place right now where we don’t particularly need the money, so I’m super happy that she wanted to do this.   Thanks for all the practical suggestions about transferring the title. We are meeting her at the DMV to get it registered to her, and will put a sale price of $20, so sales tax will be minimal. Im not sure if she will let us pay for the registration or not.   I think we will put the $500 in the glove box with a note. Then maybe my wife will text her in a day or so to make sure she found it.   UPDATE 2: Everything went great and she is now driving her new car. Thanks to everyone for tips and ideas to make the whole thing go smoothly. Met at the DMV. The girl actually getting the car (from the texts) was pretty quiet and shy, but thankful. Her mother, on the other hand, was super excited (maybe to the embarrassment of her daughter?). We offered to pay for the registration, but she said she had it, and I didn’t want to make it awkward by insisting. My wife did leave some money in the glove compartment with a note for her to find later.  When she was done at the DMV, the girl hugged my wife and thanked her again.   I’ve been contacted by a few media outlets asking to do a story on this, but I think I will decline. I originally posted it because it made me feel really good and I thought it would help other people to feel good, which it seems to have done beyond what I imagined. I certainly wasn’t looking for accolades or recognition (or even that super valuable karma), and my wife feels even more strongly about this.  I know it’s been shared on instagram and that’s fine with me, with or without credit. Like I said, I’m not worried about getting credit. 
"This is so sweet! A similar thing happened to my parents when I was growing up. My dad had recently lost his job and my mom was a stay at home mom with four kids, so money was extremely tight. Our car broke down and my parents had finally scraped together enough money to buy a cheap car. Mom posted about it on Facebook and some sweet old lady messaged her telling her she was going to give us her van she never drove anymore. It really blessed our family and it's made my parents some of the most generous people I have ever met. Your wife is just  amazing for doing this.   Edit: Okay fine y'all are picky. Let me change ""when I was growing up"" to ""When I was 5 or 6"" "
Today you, tomorrow me
Is your wife an angel?
This warmed my cold, jaded heart. Sometimes I think I spend too much time on r/choosingbeggars and so it’s really nice to see something like this. 
It seems like in the last few years the world has been inundated with people who see kindness as a character flaw and generosity as an exploitation of the weak and gullible. It’s been disheartening and sad. Seeing examples like this however, reaffirms for me that there are still special people around who do things not for personal gain but rather to benefit others and make their lives better. Thank you for sharing this and for showing that someone with true riches isn’t a Trump or an Osteen but rather someone with a huge heart. Please give your wife a hug for me. 
*Car salesman slaps car's roof*  This bad boy can fit so much wholesomeness.
On the Bill of Sale you will save them a lot of money on their taxes if you put that you sold the car for $1.
I did this once and never again, in 2008, I had a tenant whose car broke down for good (engine issue) so he had no way to get to work. I just so happened to have my (had since new) 94 Ford Escort wagon, 189k miles, kept in great shape mechanically and visually, it was just sitting in my driveway not being used. I offered it to him for free, he thanked me, life was going good for him, got a girlfriend and then he moved in with her 3 months later, which I don't care, good for him, but then I find out he immediately traded it with a mechanic for a POS Cadillac, cause he didn't like being seen in a Ford Wagon. BTW, the caddy broke down on him too.
This is the epitome of wholesomeness
Can I marry your wife?
This is awesome OP. Your wife seems like a real awesome lady 
"That is honestly such a nice gesture. I had opened your post on another tab and closed the main page, I had to go back and find this post again just so I can come here to comment.  You could tell just from the way the ""buyer"" was responding that they were also a genuinely nice person, almost didn't want it at first for free. This was just an all around wholesome post. What made it better was the comment by the OP, they are planning to give some extra cash on top of the free car. I mean, what can I say.  Bravo Sir! Bravo!"
"Just FYI when selling (or giving) a car a great way to make sure that the paperwork is done is to meet at the local tax office.  That way you can go in together, and make sure the title is properly transferred.  The buyer is already taking the time out of their day to purchase the car and it saves them the hassle of making a separate trip.     This can be important if there's an accident, traffic fines or tolls, so you aren't on the hook for still ""technically"" owning the vehicle. "
That mother of three will never forget you two.  Edit: Genuine mistake. Was sleep drunk and thought I saw a 3 in there somewhere for some reason.
Make sure you list a small purchase price on the title transfer, rather than saying it’s a gift, that way the new owner will have to pay taxes on the listed purchase price, rather than the full appraised value of the car.  EDIT: I forgot to add the disclaimer that this might not apply in all states.
Oh please give your wife a big hug from some random girl y’all are making cry with this act of kindness. She was waiting on a car for her tax return...probably been waiting for months for that check like lots of us. Now she’s not only not having to spend it but y’all are giving her a mode of transportation that is her OWN. You’re giving her some independence. This is so much more than the value of the car. Man, you guys. And then I come here and read that your wife is throwing half a grand on top of that to just be so sweet it makes my stomach tell me to stop reading because it can’t take anymore sugar today! Your wife is great, you’re obviously great by association. I love seeing stuff like this even if it makes me bawl my eyeballs out.
You and your wife literally changed an entire family’s life for the better, beyond their wildest dreams (I’m sure). Good on you and your wife for being good people. Karma will be looking out for you both. How freaking wholesome, this is awesome.
There was facebook when you were growing up? I feel so old.

I’ve heard the deep space pilots talk about them
Same, almost brought a tear to my eye. 
Don't let /r/choosingbeggars shape your heart too much, I reckon at least half of the popular posts are fake.  This one clearly isn't though :D
Also, that it's so hard for a person to believe that a stranger would do something nice for them. It's a rough world. Let's be nice to one another.
Not in Texas. They base the registration on the value of the car (by looking up the VIN), not what you paid for it. 
I feel ya. I knew something like that would happen if we just posted “free car” on FB or CL. The way we did it, we know she actually wanted this car, and was willing to pay for it.  
"You were nice to do what you did, and I hope you aren't truly feeling ""never again"". You did something nice, which had an ongoing positive impact since the guy used the car for at least 3 months.   General advice to do-gooders: don't give away something you can't afford to give. And if you want to attach strings to a gift, then be clear up front what those conditions are.   People who are in a depleted position in life are more likely, on balance, to have poor decision making skills so it may be unrealistic to think that they would make the same, informed financial decisions that you would make.  But, truly, please feel good about the helpful thing you did, regardless of how it turned out in the end."

Thanks. I’m glad she responded the way she did. She could have just been like “great, give me my car, thanks.”  I subscribe to r/choosingbeggars too, and this could have gone **much** differently. 
If you’re in New York this should be done at the dmv. Easiest way to turn over the plates as well as make sure everything is handled properly   Edited to clarify

I'm soo glad there wasn't FB around when I grew up. Oh god the cringe. 
One of the best posts in Reddit history. I love going back and re-reading this
"Was expecting to read something wholesome, but honestly pretty typical. That story made me straight up emotional.  Reminded me of the story of why I can't ignore people begging for money like I used to.  Was in a bad financial situation my first semester of college (financial aid issues, so I had to drain most of my highschool savings to pay out of pocket). Had also just had my truck stolen and stripped (didn't have full coverage since it was old, so ended up in the red for the impound fees on the remaining skeleton). This meant I couldn't commute from home as planned, so I found an old acquaintance that needed a roommate to split rent on his rundown apartment. It was dirt cheap, but it was enough to drain my remaining savings.   Was walking home late from class through a rough part of town to my apartment shortly after all this and was feeling generally depressed about it all when I see a homeless man approaching on a dark stretch of street. He had a limp, really ratty clothes and the smell of a guy that hasn't had access to a shower in quite some time. The guy gets uncomfortably close to me and tells me all about his recent run of bad luck including losing his job and needing money to see a doctor. I told him I genuinely had no money to give, but he kept pressing me. So I just open up and tell him about my recent run of bad luck and how I'm not sure how I'll pay the rent if I don't get the job I'd had to apply for after purging my savings.   Dude seemed to get the idea and so we part ways, until suddenly I feel a hand in my back pocket. I spin around ready to fight only to see the guy running away. He hadn't taken my wallet, he'd shoved a ten dollar bill in there. I run and catch him to give his money back but he wasn't having any of it. He just opened his arms and gave me a huge hug, then told me ""we all gotta look out for each other man, that's just how it works"".  Pretty sure I cried for the remainder of my walk home.  TL;DR Roadside helper story reminds me of the time a homeless man once asked me for money, but ended up giving me the little he had after hearing of my (relatively small) misfortune, because ""that's just how it works""."
Thanks for linking that ;)
They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe.
You're not crying!  I'm crying!  wait....
A few years ago I was supporting my (now ex) boyfriend and money was extremely tight. I was at the grocery store and my total came to exactly the amount I had in my bank account, which I mentioned to the cashier because I thought it was funny, and the older man behind me looked at me with a concerned look and offered to pay for my groceries because he didn't want me spending my last cents on lunch supplies. I declined (payday was the next day anyway), but that was the one time someone who wasn't family tried to help me, and even though it was only for ten or so dollars, it restored a decent amount of my faith in humanity and made me so happy.   It's so uncommon for people to help one another like this. 
I like you. Thats all I wanted to say buddy. I just wanted to say I like you as a stand up guy. That is all. 
You guys are definitely both keepers.
I honestly feel like there's a very good chance she'll refuse the 500. She seems like a very nice person and so do you and your wife! 
"Fuck, you should look at the registration laws and the rules around gifting. It may be better for her if you ""sold"" it for $100 instead of gifting it. Gifting it may put her on the hook for market value, whereas she may be better off basing it on what she ""paid"". Varies state to state."
No, I don’t even know how many kids she has, although she mentions “kids”, so it’s more than one. Also people have been assuming she’s a single mother, which we don’t really know either.   I hope she doesn’t have too many kids. The car is a 2005 Jetta, not a minivan or something big. 
Dude you're still growing up! Hell, so am I and I'm 35.
I still bummed that the story about the guy who fell in love with the woman he married for insurance benefits is no longer on reddit.
Yeah they should hook up.
OP could hide it in the glove box with a note 
You never stop growing up. I'm 27 and sometimes I still feel like a kid playing house. Sometimes it randomly occurs to me that I'm an adult and if I want pop tarts and candy for dinner there's no one stopping me anymore. I moved out at 18, so this shouldn't be a new concept to me. 
Damn, just that short description sounds interesting as hell. I've missed out!
[r/relationshipadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice)
My grandparents used to do this every time we would come up to visit them.  My mom was a single mom to 2 of us (a widow first, and then had the bad luck to run across MY father) and was doing things all on her own, an hour away from her parents.  We went up to visit about every month.  My grampa always found a time to step outside with the dogs, or run out to the barn, or go down to the basement and out through the garage to sneak a bit of cash into the glove box.  One time when I was about 8, grampa gave me a $50 bill to give to my mom, but I wasn't allowed to give it to her until we were halfway home.  I got to feel like part of the gift, and it was pretty awesome.
It's a great read.  I haven't been able to find it, but if you can it's worth your time.  Here's the cliffnotes so you can experience some of the wholesomeness.  I'm probably off on a bunch of details, but I got the broad strokes.  The guy in question was in the military.  His wife had passed away a few years previous, leaving him a single father of two young boys.  A sister of a friend of his had an illness and I think she was going to college, and since he was in the military, he had great insurance, so he offered to marry her so that she could take advantage of the healthcare benefits.  She moved in to his house, in a separate room as the marriage was platonic.  She helped out with his sons, going as far as to correct them when they called her 'mom' and telling them that mom was the angel whose picture was above the fireplace. ^((man I recollect that really clearly)^).  They became very close, but still platonic.  She had gotten over her illness, but the guy was realizing that he was starting to become attracted to her in a romantic way.  He was developing serious feelings for her and told his buddy.  He decided to ask her out on an actual date.  I think he arranged a dinner with her where he was going to ask her to go out with him (or maybe it was just a conversation after work or something)  She seemed down and the guy was confused.  She said that her brother had told him what was up, that the author wanted to pursue a relationship, but the brother had made the author's wife think that the author wanted to pursue another woman.  She the author got to deliver a great line, something to the effect of 'yeah, I want to ask someone out, but I'm already out with her.'  Over the course of a few threads, the author relays that they've started dating for real, boned a ton, and were expecting a baby girl.  It's a pretty great series and a shame that it got taken down.  Like I said, I've searched for it a few times, but I've never been able to track it down.  If you can find it, give it a read.  But no matter what, please do not let this story distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.   ^^^^^^^^^^I  ^^^^^^^^^^need  ^^^^^^^^^^about ^^^^^^^^^^tree ^^^^^^^^^^fiddy

I'm so angry and confused. Is this a real or are you just fuxking with me? 
Minus the lawyer that’s actuallly very good advice for married people too. I think social media destroys a lot of marriages. And letting yourself go, of course. 
But where do you keep your driving gloves? Do you not use driving gloves?      Savage. 
Oh, no it's all real, I just saw my opportunity and took it at the same time.
Lawyers are always helpful, we can do so much for you.  We can help draft a will, or advanced care directives, give you tax advice, or help you fight a speeding ticket.   Lawyers, not just for criminal court and divorce.^^TM   
I grew up in a similar situation, it was the people like that mom that ignored where I lived, ignored my parent’s names in the police logs and treated me like a regular kid that made me realize *I* was not the situation I was in.   Edit-  Wow, certainly wasn’t expecting all that! It’s made for a good day for reading some outstanding responses! Thanks to everyone who replied with good happiness stuff!   I received some PM’s from people asking how my life is these days- I’m 36, engaged to an AMAZING woman who I’ve been with for 11 years, we bought our first house last year and I’ve got a great job in property management as a property engineer. My life is pretty good, prettttty, pretttty good these days. Not the music career I set out for, but I wouldn’t trade my life for anything else!
"There was a poor immigrant boy at my high school with a horrible cleft palate. He was teased constantly. One day my Mom picked me up and saw the boy. She asked me about him and I gave her some brief answers.   My mother contacted the school and got the parents information. They spoke no English, and so were too intimidated/scared to take him in for government supported health care. She walked them through the entire process over a few weeks.   He was gone for a week and returned to school looking very different. Remembering my mother's interest in him, I came home and told her ""hey, that boy got surgery"" Only then did I find out what she'd been up to for the last few weeks.   Caring mothers ftw.   Edit: this response really resonated with so many of you! Thank you for the many kind comments about my mother. "
This is wonderful. I grew up poor and in fifth grade there was a gift exchange. I privately asked the teacher if I could not participate because I couldn’t afford a gift for another child. Of course I knew I wouldn’t receive a gift either. When the gift exchange came, to my surprise my name was called. My teacher had bought a few small gifts for me so I wouldn’t be excluded. I’ve never forgotten that act of generosity. 
That mother is doing parenting right. Kids shouldnt deal with that shit.
"I'm not poor, but this is my story.  When i was 9 years old, my primary school, my teacher and class, planned a ""bring your own food"" lunch. This meant that you were supposed to bring snacks, soda drinks, or even your own recipes.  I didn't explain it properly to my mom, so she said ""take this half empty bag of chips"", which is completely unnaceptable to take anywhere, for obvious reasons. I brought to my class with a ""One Punch Man face"" of complete lack of understanding of how ridiculous i looked, and how humillianting and poor my family made me look like.   My mom didn't try to make me look bad, nor she is a bad person, she just thought i was going somewhere with my friends and might have thought i wanted to eat something.   I showed half a bag of chips to my teacher, she freaked out and told me to leave the room because if i had no food i couldn't participate. (Where the fuck am i supposed to go now). I was the only one to leave the room and sat near a big wall outside of the building facing towards the school's gate, still inside the school perimeters. Then this random woman (probably a visitor to the school or something) came in the school, talked with me and i told her what happened. She just got up, said ""I'l be right back"", came back and gave me a plastic bag full, with at least 5 different chip brands (Lays,Cheetos,Ruffles, Doritos and Pringles).  I had no idea what the fuck was happening, i didn't know her, and i was a total NPC just saying yes and following her around. She took me back to my class AND PRETENDED TO BE MY AUNT WHO LEFT WORK TO HELP ME, SHE LIED TO MY TEACHER.  To this day, i wonder who the fuck that lady was!  That is the weirdest most beautiful moment of my life."
What a great mom, truly.   I remember as a kid going to a birthday party and giving my friend a present we bought at a yard sale. It was a used teddy bear and it had a stain on it and it was what we could afford and I remember being so embarrassed because the other kids had good gifts.
Well, I know what I'm doing on my daughter's next birthday.   She's very good friends with a refugee in our village - he's one of 6 kids being taken care of by a single father. The boy is out later than everyone else, going from friend's house to friend's house looking for someone to play with and somewhere to get more attention than he does at home. Some days, we are busy with something else or my daughter doesn't want to play and it is a bit heartbreaking to send him away.   He is a great and happy kid, well-behaved and creative. I never really thought about how he might be aware of what he doesn't have compared to everyone else, but I think this is a perfect way to help him to deal with that if it is an issue for him. 
i hope they find that mom and thank her.   My mom was a refugee and didn't go to birthday parties because they couldn't afford a gift. She made one once and was mocked and teased. That was the last party she went to. She's over 80 years old now and it's still something that weighs on her how it must have been so hard on her parents to know it was happening and not be able to help. How I wish she had met a mom like this. 
I was raised poor as my parents separated and my mom was going back to school as we were in elementary.  But to honest, my mom always did her best to now let us realize our situation. She would go a day without eating so we could have normal lunches with puddings and fruit snacks and such. Sure we had no cable tv and my brother and had to each get a paper route to buy things, but i just thought that was normal.  I can never express my gratitude enough for this
I am a parent that has struggled. I recall too many times I had to tell my son he couldn’t go to a friends party because I couldn’t find anything we could use as a gift and there was no way we could afford to buy something decent.  As often as possible, if given the forewarning, I would make something, though. I had compiled craft supplies, so if I knew what the kid was into I’d make a set of perler bead characters from a game they liked, or paint something “cool” they could have put in their room.  My son always helped with the design and process.  It hurts that I couldn’t do something so simple for him, but I’m glad I was able to at least give this much. Bless the OPs friends mom for understanding and not shaming or embarrassing the child for the failure of a poor parent, as that is our fault.
"This is turning into a mum appreciation thread, so don't mind me joining in. Our house was always the ""everyones welcome"" house. There were 3 of us kids anyway, but every night we'd have 1-3 kids extra for dinner. Both my sister and I also had a friend who often felt unwelcome in their home and they stayed with us a lot. My sisters friend actually stayed with us for weeks. One of my friends once called me super late saying her mum had kicked her out and my mum had zero hesitation of letting her come stay with us until needed.   Always been grateful for having such a fab and caring mum, but her generosity and caring nature towards so many other people is what makes her an actual great person in general. I'll def be having an open house policy for my kids and their friends too! "
This shocks me. I couldn’t imagine my child writing something like this when he’s an adult. I hope I never struggle that much I can’t feed my child.  Sorry you went through this OP. 
I grew up in a home where no one would buy food for fear the other one would eat it. No toilet paper for the same reason. Afraid the other parent would use it. They eventually got divorced. But while living there, an elderly couple lived next door. I remember the old lady giving me PB&J sandwiches over the fence. She hand made clothes for my Barbie dolls.. I loved animals . When her poodle has puppies, she let me into her house to pet and play with them every day. This was over 50 years ago. I've never forgotten her kindness.  
Is this what we're doing today? We're crying. Okay I guess. ALL ABOARD
I was the spoiled 7 year old dick that wouldn’t let the poor kid play with my toys at my birthday party. I really wish I could apologize to him today. I’m 35.   Edit: thanks for all of your kind words and advice. Just take the OP’s post as something to consider for people that you run into in your children’s future. It’s a gift to impact one’s life that resonates decades later. Cheers to you all. 
When I was a kid the other moms in the class bought me shoes every time I needed them. They said they were left over or unneeded but I realized as an adult that all the kids in the class likely didn’t have my same shoe size and they always fit well. 
Holy shit I just helped my mom with something similar recently. We live in the Deep South, so poor kids usually don’t have heavy coats for when it drops below 40 a dozen days a year. Instead of handing coats to the poor kids and making them insecure, my mom hosts a fashion show at her school for coats where the kids get to keep them after. I spent my whole day last Monday as a judge for the fashion show where a bunch of poor kids got to pretend they were rich models for a day, and got a winter coat out of it.   I swear my mom could find a way to make kids feel good about receiving any charity.

I’m by no means rich but I’m not hurting either.   My best friend is a single mom with several kids.    She does her best for the kids.   But they need a lot of attention and she has no family support.    I always make sure they have things.   I took them back to school shopping, I’ve taken each of the kids out for their birthdays.    I made sure they got to go vacation this last year.   I have a cousin in a similar situation, divorced with several kids.    But her kids are spoiled rotten and she doesn’t pay a lot of attention to them.   Ive gotten them things occasionally and they never appreciated the gift and trashed it almost immediately.      So screw family.    My friends kids always say thank you.   But what broke my heart and made me dedicate to taking care of them was when i had promised them (friends kids and mine) that we would go out and for whatever reason we didnt get to.   One of her sons, when i said ill take you another day, looked broken then said “promise?”    My heart broke.    I realized that his dad always promises the world and then nothing, cant even be bothered to visit.   That moment i was like I will be there for this kid.   I will show him and his siblings good people exist
I realize now something my mom did for a friend I had in second grade. He lived a few blocks over, with his dad raising him as a single parent. His clothes were outgrown, he was always too skinny, not really clean, all that.  The times he came over he would eat. I mean EAT. And not take the hint when it was time to leave. My mom picked up on it, and would try to have a Tupperware packed with leftovers when it was time to go.   I used to think she was just an over zealous Midwest mom, but as an adult I know she was trying to make sure my friend could eat home cooked food every week.
I can't really remember, I was too young. But we grew up poor also.   My oldest sister didn't get on the bus with myself and my other sister. Mom didn't know until we got home, and a teacher called and said Jackie (oldest) was safe and with her. They showed up about an hour later and Jackie came running through the door and showed mama her brand new shoes, and ran off to show Dana (other sister).  Teacher came walking up and gave my Mom a pair of shoes. Jackie's old ones. All tore up with big holes in the soles and falling apart. Mom broke down and just bawled on this teacher's shoulder apparently. She said her kids would never wear anything like that again, took them and hung them on a nail in her closet. Still there, 24 years later. We never went without. The family was still poor, but we kids never knew it.   Same teacher reached out to her church and let them know what was up. One day they just showed up out of the blue, whole congregation went grocery shopping for us. We apparently had more food than cabinets.   There is still good people out there, just have to look for them.
When I was in the first grade, I invited all of the boys in my class to my birthday party. There was this one kid who couldn't afford a gift but was a ridiculously good artist, especially for being 6. He drew me a picture of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which were wildly popular at the time.   Decades later, I don't have any of the toys I got as presents but I still have that picture tucked away. 
It is precious when a mother is so skilled in the art of caring, that she can see and nurture not only the needs of her own family, but all those who surround her family.  Those special people are angels on earth.
"It's my birthday today.I recently broke up with someone who isolated me. I asked all my friends if they could come join me on a fun adventure and all of them declined. So I'm sitting at a French cafe, sipping a latte and feeling so alone. This brought a smile to my face. There is some good in this world. I want to be that mother. The best way to get over feeling hurt is to help someone who worse off.   Edit: Thank you all for all the birthday wishes! I went to see a ""magic time machine"" by David London and had a wonderful time. I am amazed by how many messages I recieved from around the world! "
Too real. A little girl in my kid's class couldn't come to his birthday party. Her family is poor and she informed me that she can't afford it. The fact that I'm paying her entry to the venue, didn't need her to bring a present and would arrange for transport amounted to nothing.  I'm really bummed about it, because I was a poor, socially awkward kid, too and I know what it is like to miss out on fun events.  If there is a silver lining, it is that we now have a direct channel of communication with her mother and can probably find a way to include her in future stuff.
I’ve been very thankful my entire life to not be in that situation. The greatest people are the ones who don’t care about home life and just care about the person.
I know the feel man. I grew up in a single wide trailer in Flint with 7-8 people at all times. Our mom used to take us to Walmart and we'd pick out fabric for her to sew our school clothes that year. 2 of 4 brothers were hooked on meth and crack and constantly broke into the house and robbed us blind(I really had to explain to my wife why I related to Shameless in such a way). I had no idea that we were poor until middle School when shoes and other things of status symbols became more prevalent.   I'm 37 now, married and have my own house, a career where I make $70k/year, and a wonderful wife that supports me and doesn't care about money (even though her family is quite wealthy). It really makes me appreciate the things that I've earned and that are mine. 
I was real hyper when I was a kid. Mr. Blackburn was the only adult to treat me with respect. He made a positive impact on my life. Tearing up while I write this.
Tell your mom that Internet strangers think she's a great human being
Your mom's a fucking amazing person
I have a cleft palate/lip and can only imagine not having it repaired, it’s rough enough having it look slightly different to normal. You’re mom has made that kids whole life better 
Mom was a super hero, that is an amazing story.  How lucky you are to have been raised by such a caring soul.
On my alternative account for this;  My mum runs a food business where she makes use of a lot of female immigrant workers, she ensures that she personally sets up all of their kids up to school and GPs and hospitals and usually throws big birthday parties for the mothers where all their kids are invited. My mums incredibly caring and has that big heart that almost all mothers have, I really appreciate what she does, especially since I’ve grown older. 
What an amazing teacher!
The kindness of teachers never fails to amaze me. I too was a very poor kid. In grade school our P.E. teacher had a small collection of brand new Nike shoes in boxes in his office. Every now and then he would give a kid a pair. I was one of those kids. He would tell us he had a deal with Nike and they wanted us to try these shoes out and give them feedback. Of course, 12-year-old me didn't understand until many years later that he was buying the shoes with his own money and giving them to the kids who needed them. He just made up the story so the kids didn't feel bad. 
I'm so sorry you had to worry about things like that. Having to talk to your teacher must have taken a lot of bravery on your part. I would have been way too shy...
"i had to wrap one of my old teddybears because i couldnt buy a new one for gift exchange.  the girl that got the gift unwrapped it and instantly screamed ""eww thats an old used teddybear"" and all the kids started mocking me and laugh at me and throw the teddybear in the trashcan instead of giving it back to me or something like that.  could be one of the reasons why i hate humanity. "
Wow. Teachers are truly some of the kindest and strongest leaders of our future generations. Thank you for sharing this put a smile on my face
it’s more embarrassing to not be able to give your friend a gift than to not get a gift. So sad this person had to deal with it.
My mom was that kind of mom.  To this day, she has friends of mine that I grew up with that call her on Mother’s Day.    One of my friends lived with us for his entire senior year because his mother couldn’t deal with him being gay. He was suddenly failing school because he was just getting yelled at from the second he got home, and he couldn’t concentrate.  My mom gave him a place to stay, and worked hard getting him into college.  He’s doing very well now.  He calls my mother “mom”, and calls his birth mother “Linda”. 
What a mean teacher. I’ve done similar potluck type things with kids in my classes and when a kid doesn’t bring anything I still have them join in and have everyone share with everyone.   I just did a candy exchange a couple weeks ago after Halloween where I asked all the kids to bring in the candy they didn’t like and trade with each other. A couple kids brought no candy but I had bought some variety mixes at the store and added them to the candy pile and had all the kids pick what they wanted.
You just met the chip fairy. She's not as popular as the tooth fairy because that bitch gives money, but chips are cool too.
>she freaked out and told me to leave the room because if i had no food i couldn't participate.  Pardon me but... what a fucking bitch.   Like seriously this made me irrationally angry to think that someone who is supposed to be an educator could be so ignorant. 
For the record, one of my favorite birthday gifts was a second-hand stuffed giraffe from a friend. I had gotten lots of new presents that day, sure, but the fact that the giraffe was old made me feel like it had already been loved by someone else and now I got to be it’s new adopted mom and give it love, too. Almost like it had its own personality, unlike all the other gifts which were just blank slates.  I’m not sure why she gave me it, but if it was because of money I hope she doesn’t/didn’t feel bad about it. I loved that giraffe!
I once went to a birthday party in 6th grade and gave my friend a dollar in a hand made card. My family was dirt poor — it was a miracle there was enough gas in the car to get me to the party. Any money I had at that point was money I’d earned myself doing odd jobs in the neighborhood, which usually consisted of picking up dead groundhogs my neighbor had shot and throwing them over a cliff. I knew my family had nothing, I knew I couldn’t show up with nothing, and that dollar was literally all I had to offer.  I think my friend understood to a degree, but given that she was 11 or 12, she wasn’t too skilled at schooling her features. It really sucked. 
Ditto! For a couple of months we lived on this old apartment building in the ghetto part of town. Everybody was new to the country and/or dirt poor. It so happened it was my birthday during the couple months and my mum was throwing a small party for me and our neighbors kids. I didn't really expect any presents or anything. Then my best friend in that group realized that I didn't get presents so she went home and grabbed her favorite teddy (though it's actually a frog) for me. Seriously meant so much to me and 20 years later, I still have it. One of my favourite childhood memories though we've long lost touch. 
So many goddamn onions in here today
You sound like a great person
Humans can be so mean to each other. We’re all stuck here together so we might as well make the most of it and be nice to each other.   I would gladly take a handmade gift over some store-bought crap any day. 
My mom and dad separated when I was very young and she brought my brother, sister and me to the U.S. and dad wanted nothing to do with us. We were also poor and my mom would also go w/out eating so she could buy groceries for the week. No cable, only enciclopedia Britanica where she would pay 10 dollars every two weeks for a set of 10. I learned more about the world because of them (years before internet.) My mom made a lot of sacrifices for her kids and one can only hope to be as great. Teaches you how to remain humble.  
"Tbh I'd prefer to receive your gifts to others. At least there's some thought in them rather than ""what do the kids like these days, action man, right?"""
Empathy is learned, you aren’t to blame. You just didn’t understand yet.
I had a Christmas party here at my place one year, my brother-in-law brought his stepson with them. I have no problem with this. Everyone is welcome to my house anytime. No matter what. With that being said, we had no idea he was coming. We started handing out presents and all the kids had got one except his son.     I grabbed one that had my name on it and put his name on it. The person handling the presents was my wife. She saw me and called the boys name and he looked around like in shock , reached out grabbed it. He was so excited to have gotten a gift card footlocker. That made my Christmas. I didn’t even open any of mine after that. 
I’m glad it all happened, really. Entirely created an open-minded outlook for me that has brought on some of the best situations/people in my life!  
Reminds me of the quote from The Perks of Being a Wallflower that stays with me to this day:  “I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there.”
I'm sure she did. His was a particularly intense one. So the improvement was dramatic. 
I know this probably won't mean much,  but I personally have found every person I've met with a repaired cleft lip adorable as hell.    It's the differences that make people special.  Embrace it,  own it.  Keep kicking ass.
He is the teacher. He understands how any kind of segregation affects our society. This simple act may change the growing person's mindset. That's not only healthy and kind and morally right thing to do. It's also practical:  beneficial for a teacher, a kid, for whole society. These days when we are dividing our society are living in our bubbles and are alienating people this make me worry.
I know it’s said a ton but teachers really deserve more respect and higher pay. I’d gladly pay some higher taxes if the money went straight into their pockets. 
"At our school we had a sunshine fund that teachers contributed to, for new shoes. One of my students was flopping her soles on both feet so the sunshine committee sent her a box of new tennis shoes.   Her mom went insane. Came stomping down the hallway SCREAMING my name amd that she wanted her daughter OUT of my class because I care too much for her daughter.   I wasn't even there that day, had a substitute. The sunshine people had put the box into her backpack with a sweet note and I didn't know about it. Her mom tried beating her in the hallway for ""lying that they don't have money for shoes"" and I stopped her. Principal and asst principal both ran down the hallway because the mother was losing on that little girl and I would not let her touch her.  She was removed from my class regardless because the mother had so much hate for me. The student scream-cried for 5 hrs a day for the following week and ran from her class to my class every time her new classroom door wasn't blocked. --- It wasn't working.  The principal ended up saying I had to teach ""the higher students""....so my precious Gia went to her new class until after morning announcements. Then she and a few others came to me, and I sent a few lower kids to her room. Right before the bell rang, she went back to prepare for bus departure.   Gia was my sunshine."
"Which is why I don't understand that they're treated the way they are in the ""greatest country in the world"""
It's more embarrassing to not have friends at all. One year I invited a bunch of friends I went to school with. We used to be into WWE real big, it was the year Undertaker returned after being gone for so long, we paid for the PPV, and one kid showed up.  I also remember my entire class went on this three day field trip, no one even noticed I stayed home sick.   I'd rather have friends at my party than gifts.
> He calls my mother “mom”, and calls his birth mother “Linda”.  I like to believe his birth mothers name isn't even Linda.
I watched many of my friends struggle with horrible home lives during my childhood years. Not having an adult to talk to and look out for you is just awful. It’s one of the main reasons I became a teacher. I’m so-so at teaching reading and math, but I am really good at listening to kids. I have a ton of students that don’t even have me for class (I teach high school) that will stop in just to let me know everything is going all right. I hope it helps them knowing that someone cares.  
I think that this is an especially important lesson for kids nowadays. Taking care of each other is how societies thrive and cementing this mindset at an early age is critical with the lack of social interaction we get now as adults.
Do you remember the friend. I bet she would appreciate it if you messaged her saying “hey remember that giraffe you gave me when we were little, I was just thinking of it today and remembered how much I loved that gift. Thank you so much for it :)”
You were a good kid. I remember my friend giving me a dirty look lol. Her parents had a lot of money so she knew my gift was trash even at 10.
"Thats a sweet gift from an adult perspective. But kids are kids i dont really blame them for not knowing how to react. They only know what they are taught. But i totally feel you i remember the look on my friends face when she got that bear. Forced politeness. I think when i have kids if they ever face something like that (poor friend giving them a ""bad"" gift) i would try to explain it to them. We are lucky to do decently now but I'd want my child to understand that not everyone is so lucky and they should always be kind."
Fr im in the bus tryna fight these ninja cuttin onions
My mom always had an extra gift or two, usually something generic like a puzzle/book and gift card for kids or one for adults in case a cousin decided to bring a new boyfriend/girlfriend or a kid we weren't expecting. Never anything expensive, but worth the extra 10-20 bucks to make sure everyone felt included. That stuck with me. 
When my sister and I were younger my father would take us to do Christmas at all of our relatives houses when we would go visit him. We would spend the whole day visiting family but at the end of the day we would go to his fiancé’s parents house. They were very well off and it was very apparent we were not very welcome there. Even as an 8 year old I felt like I did not fit. They would exchange these extravagant $500+ gifts and then give my sister and I (the only children there) a scarf and a hat. Not that we were greedy or not appreciative but it was very clear that we were an after thought. Something about that never sat right with me. Now with my children and family we make sure that anyone who is coming feels part of the family no matter what. This is a great thing you did for that young man. 
Internet stranger here, also in agreeance
Maybe because America is far from the greatest country in the world as far as our morals, appreciation for others, and education go. 
I've noticed that the teachers in my three girl's schools are doing stuff like this. Even in middle school, they call their classes teams, they encourage support, they encourage helping each other. Honestly they reinforce the stuff I try and teach my kids. One of my daughters has a friend who is disadvantaged I don't know the whole situation but I know that she's not able to participate in a lot of stuff. So when food drives come around or their classes adopt families for Christmas my sweet little girl always wants a second set of whatever she's taking so her friend isn't embarrassed. I was in her friend's position growing up so I'm always happy to do it.   Anyway I'm super happy to see the emphasis on caring for each other that my girl's school district has. 
My mom does this too! She’d stock up on things like candles, soap, lotion, fuzzy socks, beanies and tonsssss of blankets (because who doesn’t love blankets) just in case. 
"The first Christmas that I spent with by husband (then boyfriend)'s family was similar with one side of the family.  His mom's side of the family knew we were both coming well in advance. When I got there, I was introduced as ""(boyfriend's name)'s friend"". I got a used, scratched up purse that had been in someone's attic, and dollar store gloves. Other last minute guests got things that were significantly better (i.e. they actually went to the store and got cool little gift baskets for said last minute guests). The other guests were also actually introduced. I wasn't expecting anything really, but I did feel like an afterthought.  His dad's side of the family was the total opposite. I had barely gotten to know these people and his grandma was demanding I make a Christmas list. So, being new, I put a few $5~ things on there and called it good. Cue a call from my future father-in-law: ""Hey, this isn't enough! You need more stuff on there!"" So I put a little bit more. Still not enough, ""Where's the big ticket stuff?""  I was introduced as his significant other, by name. I got everything I had put on my list. I didn't expect half that stuff, let alone everything. His dad welcomed me with open arms and went the extra mile to make me feel like I was part of the family. They all did. Sweetest bunch of people.  It doesn't take much. Like you said, it's not about greed, it's about making people feel welcome and not like an afterthought."
Another one here. I'm not in agreeance, but I opt into agreement.
If they're the fuzzy fleece kind, I'll see you at Christmas! 
Our FedEx delivery bro's do this as well... started a few months ago. Glad to know they're all starting to look out for package thieves. This is really awesome!
That man right there is someone who takes pride in his work.   He doesn't do actions like this for the glory, the acclaim or the pay, he does it because it feels right.   I've been privileged to observe people like these a few times in my life, and have come away humbled and inspired.

My Amazon person put something in my backyard! I thought it was stolen, but then checked the delivery photo and was pleasantly surprised.
DHL is the best. Rather that the strongly agree/disagree format for surveys we should start asking “On a scale of USPS to DHL...” I’m pretty sure anyone that has every shipped anything will instantly understand.
People like this deserve to get their boss called to tell them how awesome they are.
Leaving packages outside your house just seems so surreal. Why is this a thing? You would get the sack for that here in the UK.
Is that how it works in america? In the uk if we’re not at home we get a slip saying we can go to the post office to collect it
Hopefully UPS jumps on the trend at some point.
Moral compasses!
"Used to work for them. Even my boss described them as **D**rop it, **H**ide it, **L**ose it, or ""*Dee-aitch-hell""*"
I had a UPS guy put a package inside my grill on my back deck because he didn’t want it to get rained on. I was very grateful for that. It poured rain all day and my package would have been ruined otherwise.
Our UPS guys (Northern California) does this as well.  It's really in everyone's best interest - it only takes a few seconds and the driver doesn't have to deal with mis-delivery claims.
I had a similar situation during a terrible storm with the Amazon guy.  If it had been left outside, it definitely would’ve gotten soaked through, but he was a good guy and stealthily hid it under my pillow. He even made sure that my blanket was covering me so that I wasn’t indecent for the delivery photo.
"When I have a delivery that requires a signature they run up to my door with the ""we missed you"" slip already filled out and they slap it on the door and run back to the truck. I have to watch the door and run out and chase the guy to get my package. Otherwise they do that twice and then I need drive across the city to the industrial zoned area where their main warehouse is and wait an hour or two for them to get the package for me. It's beyond frustrating so I refuse to deal with them for shipping if I have a choice."
r/holup
Same exact story twice now I complained to some ups number eventually a local ups called and apologized about the driver not knocking and just placing the slip on. I signed it left it on the door and the next day they did the same thing and dint even see my signed slip.. my gf ran out while the delivery person had the package petting our dog lol
One time I saw an amazon delivery person drive up to my apartment building, realize im on the third floor of a walk up...and get back in their car and leave, just to get a notification on my phone that they were unable to deliver to the provided address.  It was quite annoying for a time sensitive delivery
"My previous Canada Post driver was awesome.  My new one..... not so much.  They apparently scan all their packages as delivered in the AM when they leave the depot, then drop them or don't throughout the day.  Last 5 or 6 packages have been tagged ""Delivered"" around 8am, but don't physically arrive at my house until 1-2pm."
Lol, I remember putting aside 2 bottles of mayo when working at Subway because this dude came every night, and would ask for like a bottle and a half of mayo on his sub; I would always be ready for him :-)      While working at that same subway, I enjoyed Chinese food on my days off. My order came to like $15.50, and I'd always give $20 to the delivery lady and tell her to keep the cash. She came by Subway once in a while, and she'd give me a $5 dollar tip every time. We exchanged tips like that the whole time I worked there, and $5 tip at Subway is a rare thing    I dunno, it just made me think of these things. You get to form a relationship with your customers, and good regulars are awesome. You get happy to see them walk in, and the good ones are always fun to server.      edit: Wow, thanks for silver and gold! I've been on reddit for years over different account, and this is my first :-)
"I used to go to the same taqueria in Santa Rosa on my day off every week and get the same burrito. Went back for a visit five years after moving away and had to get a burrito. The guy behind the counter gave me a big grin and said ""hey, man! Where you been?!"" I shrugged and said ""eh, Iowa."" Best damned burritos ever. "
Tuesday morning my 5 year old woke up and his eye was extremely swollen and red. Like really bad. I took him to urgent care up the road and after being examined the doctor, she was very concerned. They prescribed antibiotics but said I needed to take him to the ophthalmologist right away. The one in my town didn’t have any same day appointments but they were able to get me into one about 45 min away. I was already holding back tears because I was scared for my son. My gas tank was on e and I don’t get paid until the 3rd. I completely lost it and told the nurse what was going on. I said I had to call some people and ask to borrow some gas money but I would get him there somehow. A minute later the doctor came in and handed me 20$ so we could get to the appointment. It was just so touching. I’m going to bring her a card with the 20$ on the 3rd. She never said I needed to pay her back but I just want her to know how much the kindness she showed meant to me. 
I'm gonna have to call bullshit.   There's no way anyone can eat gas station burritos everyday and live long enough to befriend the clerk.
The people at chipotle used to make my dads burrito when they saw his car pull into the parking lot and let him go to the front of the line to pay.  
"9 thousand years ago, I was a teenager with my first job in the mall, and I was fixated on root beer. The older lady (60's?) in the food court struck up a friendship with me, and revealed that although her franchise had discontinued their sarsparilla, she still had a tankard of the concentrate under the counter. From then on, I got one every day, exclusively, and she nicknamed me ""the Sarsparilla Kid"".  Coolest nickname I ever had."
"Tell you what, any place of service business that I go to where they call me by name, know my habits, and generally try to make my life easier? They get a customer for life. I'll drive a mile farther for gas because the gas station attendant at the closer place *once, years ago,* made me buy something to break a dollar for quarters.  Also worth doing if you want to ~~illicit~~ elicit that kind of great service: go out of your way to be polite to workers. Look them in the eye, say ""hello"" with a smile, get their name at some point, use it the next day. I gave Starbucks cards to every employee at the local billiards hall a year ago. Cost me like 60 bucks, but then they also often give me free food, free beer, etc. It works out well. If you frequent the place, show your appreciation. "
I swear, gas station bros are the REALEST. I go to my 711 almost every day and they're all my besties. I went tonight and there was a new guy and we hit it off like we've known each other for years.  Love you all, my gas station homies <3
"My local donut shop consistently makes my favorite donuts now, and they almost always have one hiding in the case somewhere when I come in.  The real sign I come in there too much was when I completed an order without speaking and didn't realize it.  The previous customer was being a dick to the guy who filled his coffee (apparently the customer didn't understand the ""room for cream"" question because of the guy's Cambodian accent) and everyone was distracted by the confrontation.  Someone lifted the coffee pot a fraction of an inch while looking at me and I nodded, and I think I did the same in response to a glance at my usual donut, and we completed the transaction completely on autopilot without saying a word."
When I worked at McD’s in college we had this sweet, middle aged woman come in every Friday night. The food order varied, but she always ordered a large coffee with six cream, six sugar. When we realized the pattern, we always made a fresh pot before she came in and had it ready for her. She was so touched the first time her coffee was waiting for her. 
God damn man that’s so fucking nice, you should spend a night with him and eat fresh burritos
"When I was super poor back in the day, there was a clerk at the gas station that would put fresh jalapeno brats on an hour before closing. I would come in 5 minutes before close, and he would say ""feel free to take anything on the rollers, just gonna throw them out anyhow."" Didn't know dude aside from being a regular there, you gotta love when people look out for their fellow man."
"i play pokemon every sunday, i go to a kfc and every time i walk in the cashier shouts ""LARGE MAC N CHEESE"" cause thats what i order every time. makes my day"
This made me think of when I used to be a cook at a diner.  Everybody assumes you don’t give a shit about your job at those type of places.  Truth is I put a huge amount of pride into every single grilled cheese/ patty melt/ whatever I made there.  So shout out to cashier bro and everyone else that is out here trying to do a good job just because they want other people to be happy. Not everybody is just at work to get a paycheck
When I was pregnant with my second bub I had a crazy craving for red rooster chicken nuggets. To the point where I recall crying when they gave me cheesy ones by mistake.   It got to the point where I was going there at around the same time every day. This amazing manager noticed my ever growing pregnant belly, recognised a craving when he saw one, and would always make sure I got a fresh batch of chickeny goodness.   He joked about me buying stock options in Red Rooster and Steggles, and would assure me they were kept hot enough and safe for a pregnant person to eat.
I used to work the graveyard shift at 7Eleven. The same dude came in every night for a Mad Dog and a Jamaican meat pie. After a few weeks he let me know that he dealt weed and I always had a discount because “working at 7Eleven sucks.”
"I've been working in a BBQ joint in Texas for almost 3 years now. I started as a cashier, now I cut meat and help with the prep and cooking sometimes.  There's this old man that's been coming in since we opened, about once every week or two. He was always kind of a grumpy man, he would just walk up to the counter and grunt ""3/4 pound of lean brisket and a jalapeño cheddar sausage, to go."" He never spoke much, never smiled, just got his food and left.   I was always really nice to him, and after a while, he started smiling awkwardly at me. Then he started making small talk. It made me feel good.   Well, our restaurant has gotten really popular in the last year, been on the news, gets excellent Yelp reviews, etc. It's gotten to the point where we sell out of food regularly. One nite several months ago, my buddy came in and we were out of brisket. He looked so upset, not really angry but just incredibly disappointed. He told me that his wife has been going through chemo, and he can barely get her to eat. On the rare occasion that she's hungry, she wants our brisket.   Damn near broke my heart. I gave him our phone number, and told him to call and ask for me when he wants to come get brisket, and I'll save it for him. (We generally don't take call in orders, especially when we're almost out of food)    I saw him last nite. He told me his wife is cancer free.  I've never seen the guy light up with such a big smile, it really warmed my heart.   That's the kind of relationship I want. "
Bottle and a half of mayo? That's... disturbing. Even if there was meat in there, that thing just had to taste like straight mayo sandwich. Drinking the bottle would be quicker. But good on you for silently helping out a bro.  Also, the $5 back and forth... haha. Shit like that is gold. Love it.
Being a regular is the greatest. I used to work across the way from a Chinese place that had great lunch deals. It got to the point that at lunch time the lady would step out of her store, look to my window and wait for my signal. Then she would drop it in for me. Nicest lady ever and I miss her.
"Subway employees are awesome if you go there a lot.  I had a Subway that I'd go to almost religiously every single day after work because I'm a creature of routine when it comes to food.  I'd get the same thing every day...two footlong cold cuts with lettuce (I'd eat the second the next day for lunch...yes, I ate a lot of Subway), american cheese, lettuce, and red wine vinegar, with a soup cup full of pickles.  After awhile, I got to know everyone that worked the late shift and would get the ""NORM!"" greeting when I walked in.  Anyways, after awhile, they would have my order ready at the normal time I came in and it was pretty awesome.  I randomly stopped going there one day and didn't go back for almost 2 years.  When I walked in, there was one person still working there that knew me.  She saw me, dropped what she was doing, ran out and gave me a hug because everybody in there legit thought I had died."
>  this dude came every night, and would ask for like a bottle and a half of mayo on his sub  https://i.redd.it/qkhp4su2gqx01.gif
Any burritos in Iowa? Just curious what they got out there. I’m in AZ and well you know we got tons of burritos 
It's quite a lifestyle.
Clearly you've never had an Allsup's burrito or been to Texas.
Dunkin employee can confirm this is real
Not as cool but the last time I went to my Chipotle the manager said he recognized me coming in often and gave me my bowl for free. Might not have been much but it made my day.
"""The Sasparilla Kid"" sounds like an old western movie. "
Where I work in a corporate catering kitchen, I go out of my way to remember all my customers names and favorites, and details about them to facilitate small talk everyday.  As somewhat of an introvert, If i suspect a cashier at a gas station, or grocery store, or fast food place starts to recognize me, I change stores.  It's an odd conundrum, but it works for me.
The dudes at my 7-11 figured out that I understood them when they spoke Arabic to each other. They call me over across the store if I’m there to play translator for them when they have customers that speak Spanish, but only ask me the questions in Arabic. It’s the most bizarre situation ever. I bring them treats for Eid and they hook me up with a free Diet Coke every once in a while, they are good dudes. 
Your story was oddly satisfying. 
That's sweet of you guys but jesus christ that barely even qualifies as coffee.
one of my good friends in highschool used to put two big scoops of maynonaise on bread and then warm it up in the microwave for a snack. makes me gag just thinking about it.
Yes! When we first ordered our favorite Indian food after moving, we opened the door and the delivery guy said “oh hey! It’s you guys!” I love being a regular. 
Not Iowa, but recently moved from San Jose to Columbus. They don't even do normal burritos out here. Everything is smothered in sauce so you have to eat it with a fork and knife. I miss my foil wrapped burritos.
She's drinking fucking Toffee
This is the grossest thing I've ever heard, and pairs well with another story I heard today of someone fucking an egg salad sandwich because he heard mayo made good lube. Maybe thats why he was really warming them up...
Sandwich ingredients: 600 calories.  Mayo: 2000 calories.
Really?  I get so embarrassed when I'm recognized as a regular!  It means I'm eating out waaaay too much...
Hmmm I’ll make a note there is an untapped burrito market out there. :)
No I think that was a coconut
We should talk business...
No, this is Patrick.
Everyone is so cordial, this made me happy!
The guy crossing, British as fuck.
What a casual legend!!! 
This all feels too satisfying for some reason 
So casual, so effective, so cool.  He's a real everyday hero.
Haha the thumbs up was perfect.  **it was a perfect thumbs up**  Edit: Thumbs*  Also thanks for all the happy wishes, you're all so nice!
Not a single word was said. Humans really do have some weird ways of communicating. 
Original video by Royal Jordanian (Definitely check out his channel if you're into bikes): https://youtu.be/lMphb6cNScM?t=1m31s   He's riding a near silent Electric bike by the way.   Edit: Guys riding in between the lanes (Lanesplitting, Filtering) is LEGAL in the U.K :D
"I was trying to explain these unspoken signals to a friend I was teaching how to drive in the city, I wish I had this video!   Bus driver waves hand down, rider knew to stop. Universal signal for ""slow the hell down"".  Pedestrian makes eye contact, offers a palm, politely giving the biker the chance to go.   Rider gives a head nod to the right and returns eye contact, to politely refuse and let the pedestrian go.   Pedestrian gives the head nod of thanks, breaks eye contact, and carries on.  Biker turns to bus driver to thank him for the warning. Mutual thumbs up, quick head nod so they both know they're on the same page, and a fist pound to seal the deal.  A whole conversation in a few nods and signals. "
I have a crush on the bus driver now thanks 
2 Beers for bus driver    Treat is  on me
Ha it's somehow all the more lovely for being in London! 
r/bettereveryloop
This is literally this subreddit's title. 
No words exchanged either, it's the little things  **EDIT: LANE-SPLITTING/FILTERING/RIDING IN BETWEEN LANES IS LEGAL IN THE UK :D**
England. 
Also the bus driver looks like big dude from wire after he became all positive 
Right! The suit, head nod and hand motion. It's like he's mentally tipping a hat.   Calmer edit: Since this is the highest post: Please by kind to each other and be more aware on the road :) Also TURN ON YOUR HEADLIGHTS WHEN IT RAINS. Sorry... ***by the way riding in between the lanes (also called Filtering or Lane Splitting) is perfectly legal in the U.K. :)***  Edit 2: Now I know what R.I.P my inbox means, I really tried to answer everyone lmao. I've been typing for two hours now.  Thank you for the gold, and have a nice day. Cheers
No no, I insist, after you! 
This whole gif is one of the most British things I've ever seen
Right!
It plays like a film or a cutscene from a video game. Really satisfying to watch 
It's so seamless
He looks like he does this all the time
Happy cake day, sweetie. ❤️

"Weird? We can communicate with smell, body language, a few noises with a special purpose (like all animals do), but we choose to communicate via a combination of very specific sounds that mean very specific things when combined in a very specific order.    But that's not universal and not effective in situations like this. About 2 hand movements from each party mean the same as the following conversation:  Bus driver: ""Wait, sir, there's a pedestrian ahead and he can't hear you""  Pedestrian: ""Oh, my, thank you, bus driver. Thank you biker. You go ahead, kind sir""  Biker: ""No, you go ahead""  Pedestrian: ""Why, thank you, sir""  Biker (to bus driver): ""Thanks for the warning""  Bus driver: ""No problem, chap"""
In the animal world, this is the norm. The weird thing is our extensive use of language. 
Damn those silent vehicles. /s, but seriously, kinda dangerous 
Riding in the same city for a while, there starts to be an unspoken language when it comes to interacting with vehicles. It changes in every country too. (I'm looking at you India with your horns! Lol)
Is ok bby
The guy's head nod was lovely
Not at all (at least in the UK). One of the main reasons to get a bike is so you can glide through traffic like this
And the timing; this was literally movie-perfect. 
Legal in California, too, thankfully 
It is legal but damn if people like this biker just do it assuming all is safe up ahead. Rule 1 is if you can't see it directly, assume there is something there.

A good bus driver is always on the lookout, not just for themselves but for all the traffic around them.   Source: Am bus driver , and I think I'm a good one.
🎩🚶
My understanding is that new EV's are required to make noise at low speeds (I think 15mph is the cutoff), in the US for that exact reason, actually.
How else did movies come to be? Life moments that had to be retold.
I dont trust people enough to do this even if it was legal 
Brit here, I would have done exactly the same. It’s instinctive.
Thank the queen for our lack of “J walking” laws 
[Are you all all right?](https://youtu.be/niOqJLPRSQ4?t=31s)
Thank you for being like this! I try to always be aware when I drive too. Keep being an awesome bus driver, it seems like a thankless job. 
Hatman means ‘sure’ in Farsi. 
The Nissan Leaf makes such a painful high pitched sound it actually feels like my ears are going to bleed and I nearly pass out.  No other electric vehicle does that to me.
Ah yes I remember when the Decepticons invaded. Dark times indeed 
There are definitely assholes, but you'd be surprised how many people will move over a little in the lane just to let you go by a little easier. 
Jaywalking isn't a criminal offence in the UK, bar motorways & NI where it can be
So smooth
Hatman it does...
"I always move over when I see a biker coming through, besides giving them some space I think it's good to let them know that ""I see you there, I am not going to cut you off!"". That and I always love it when they throw a peace sign back at me :)"
Wouldn’t that just be “peating “ them?
*She should be 55 this year, but PAN AM Flight Attendant Neerja Bhanot of Chandigarh, India died at 23 being a hero. She is credited with saving the lives of 360 passengers onboard PAN AM 73. When radical Islamic terrorists hijacked her A/C in Karachi, Pakistan she informed the pilots (who used their escape hatch to runaway) and kept both the passengers/remaining crew calm. When the terrorists demanded to know who the Americans were on the flight so they could execute them she gathered all the passports and hid the ones belonging to Americans under seat cushions. The terrorists confused and unable to determine the national origins of the passengers didn't execute anyone. When Pakistani police raided the plane she was able to nearly singlehandedly evacuate all the passengers as the firefight ensued. She being one of the last people on board did a last check and found three children still hiding. As she led the children to safety the surviving terrorists spotted the children and opened fire on them. Neerja jumped in the way of the bullets and was mortally wounded. She was able to evac the children to safety before dying from her wounds.*   *Neerja was awarded the Ashok Chakra Award by India, the highest peacetime gallantry award possible. She was the youngest and first civilian to ever be awarded this honor.*  Source: https://imgur.com/gallery/Ds8ozNF
 From the Pan Am Citation::  >In memory of Neerja. Her time with us was all too short. Her fond memory will fly with us forever - Pan Am Neerja joined the Pan Am family on Jan. 16, 1986. Her employment with Pan Am was a great source of joy for her and her beloved family. Her special leadership qualities were quickly recognized and she was elevated to the position of 'Purser' on April, 1986. Neerja was the Senior Purser aboard Pan Am Clipper 73, which was hijacked by armed terrorists at Karachi airport. Her gallant actions were nothing less than heroic as she, along with nearly 400 other passengers and crew members, was held at gunpoint, constantly under the threat of death, for over 16 hours. Setting aside all concern for her personal safety and well-being, Neerja identified herself to the terrorists as the crew member in charge of Clipper 73. Her decision to take responsibility for the situation at hand was in the highest traditions of excellence and service to her fellow man. Neerja stood as a symbol of leadership. Her fellow flight attendants looked to her for strength, which they found in Neerja's calm and professional manner, which helped to heighten the spirits and hopes of everyone. She provided assistance to passengers at every juncture, giving special attention to small children and elderly passengers, who found comfort where otherwise, there was none. In the final hour, she gave her own life, while shielding three small children from gunfire. Neerja was called upon under the most difficult conditions, at the most difficult time, to step forward in a position of leadership. And her heroic actions were responsible for saving of hundreds of lives. She is deeply mourned and sadly missed and will always be remembered in thoughts and prayers by members of her large Pan Am family. Her actions will live on as a testament to the highest ideals. We were honoured to call Neerja sister and one of our own.  Source - [http://neerjabhanot.org/pac.htm](http://neerjabhanot.org/pac.htm)
Man its horrible that people like this don't get remembered 
"Wow.  I pulled up her Wiki, it is slightly different, but the story is the same.  She saved so many lives at 22. I'm 35 and I doubt I'd be able to do more than protect myself and my son.  > They saw Neerja relentlessly trying to help the passengers out and that is when they caught her by her ponytail and shot her point blank."" She was shot while shielding 3 American children from a hail of gunfire from the terrorists. Out of a total of 44 American passengers, two were killed during the hijacking"
A movie called Neerja was made to honor her and her sacrifice.
The sad part is that unfortunately, there was no justice for her killers. All the hijackers were captured by the Pakistanis.  * Convicted and sentenced to death * Death commuted to life sentence * All of them were released within ten years. * Most of them are back doing what they do.  Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neerja\_Bhanot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neerja_Bhanot)
I hope that the children remember her
There are people in human history whos names should have the distinct honor of being remembered always, hers is such a name. 
Holy fuck

I was expecting sensationalism, but she legit saved the fuck out of people.
I was on this flight. I am an American citizen and was at the time. I was only a child. My mother, my sister, and my grandmother were all on this flight.  We all survived.     Thank you. 
Holy hell. And she was only 23.
Just to add onto this, Neerja's background makes her actions even more heroic.  Neerja was a model. She began modeling at 18 and, when her career flourished, was married at 22. It was both traditional and untraditional: the marriage was arranged, but no dowry was offered. Then, within a few months of marrying, her husband became abusive. He beat her, starved her, and denied her access to money. Her family was shocked and horrified. Neerja escaped that marriage because she had been previously contracted for a modelling job that got her away from him. While she was gone, her husband sent her a letter describing what he would do to her and how he would treat her, and telling her she'd have to accept it if she returned because she's worthless - just a poor daughter not even deserving of a dowry, and a mere graduate. So she didn't return. Instead, she took a job as a flight attendant to prove herself.   It's...incredible. She was a model who married without a dowry, who was physically abused by her husband for that lack of dowry, who was told over and over that she was no one, that she was worthless. She became a flight attendant on a whim. And somehow, she had the courage to defy armed terrorists, to repeatedly plot against them to protect her passengers, and even to physically shield those children when faced with gunfire.   She deserves every award given to her.  *Edit:* typo. I thought I proofread but there was still a typo.
Thanks for sharing this.
What a beautiful response by Pan Am.  Made me tear up.  May Neerja’s life be an inspiration to us all.  
Her whole story is fucking epic. She took control of the situation and saved 300 lives 
We'll remember her. She is not forgotten.
Be a good dad. Bit by bit we can make life better for all of us. Hopefully we won't need big sacrifices in the future.  Edit: Thank you kind stranger
Don't regret not having to give your life in an extraordinary situation. I don't think Nerrja wanted to be killed as a stewardess. She just stepped up in a bad situation. If this has never happened she wouldn't be thinking back on her life as not having accomplished anything. Make the best of what you have now.
I’d watch this movie
That's fucked up. They deserve a life sentence. 
One did. A 7 year old on the flight became a pilot. Said she was his inspiration to do so and says he never forgets what she did for him.
Ya somebody needs to make this movie, absolute heroism and pure selfless 
Some people are just so badass this is all you can say about them. “Holy fuck” sums up this woman perfectly. I’m gonna go watch the movie about her later tomorrow. 
I love that she continues to be recognized. What a legacy. 
If this is true, and the memories aren’t too traumatic for you, you should consider doing an AMA (and provide proof if you have any way to document it). 
22. She died 2 days before her 23rd birthday.
Yeah wow, so well written.
359 lives.
Yes but she should be a household name shes a fucking hero
It used to be on Netflix for quite a while. Not anymore sadly. 
You should! It’s one of the only movies to have ever made me tear up. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions and the acting is amazing. 
But its Pakistan, Stuff like this makes them local hero and they are almost given highest powers and full protection in the country.
There is a movie! I don't remember the title, but I remember I cried a lot.   Edit: it's called Neerja
And that its a multinational gathering of recognition. India, Pakistan, US, UK. Good shit. 
She is now. Here in Ahmedabad we have a self defense class named after her in most schools.
Not really. The Pakistani government harbors terrorists. The locals hate them as much as anybody.
Indian law does justify it. But if you notice they were not tried in India, they were tried in Pakistan.
Neerja. 
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5286444/
It’s on Netflix, really good.
If there's one thing India and Pakistan can agree on, it's that this woman was a hero. 
"""We'd rather you didn't"" - Rest of the world"
They could disagree with how they were represented in the movie while admiring her (which they clearly did, given that they gave her an honour).  
What a very good boi!  And the dog is pretty special as well.  Thanks for taking such good care of him.
That breaks my heart to see this guy struggling.  Kudos to you for caring and helping, and give that sweet baby a couple of extra pats for me.
I didn't need to cry again today, but I did. Please give your dog a nice belly rub from me.
Aw..Good boy.  He is adorable. Hope he continues to be well. I like the fact that you built sides up high for his security!    My Pup seemed to think the car ramp was a designated torture device. He avoided it like the plague. I had to recruit neighbors, friends and strangers to help me lift Bubba into the car for vet visits! One time my bug man helped me. Nice guy:)
Awww, and he does with a smile on his face.  So cute!
My pug pancho was 13 and a half years old when he passed on September 2018, he fought against heart disease, being blood poisoned, eye surgery, and bone density problems since birth, we knew it would be lots of money spend, but he was family and it was all worth it till the last day. Keep fighting and helping him, I’m sure he appreciates it
Exactly.  What a dear, sweet doggo.  And what a champ the human is for building him a ramp.
"Pugs are so ""pure"" that this is the result of it. They all get these problems. Endless inbreeding is doing them in along with most pure breeds. They have so many inherit health problems its almost unethical to get one as it encourages more to be bred. Good on this hooman for making its time more comfortable."
thanks u/TheLegendOfEatingAss
It's actually him just trying to breathe.
i am the dog, n this my ramp  my human friend is Such a champ!  he  made it special, just  for me,  so i go up n down easy!  am trying hard to fight disease,   this helps me climb the stairs with ease  he cares so much, it makes me feel  He's helping *most*  my heart to heal  ❤️
"And until the day comes, here's a poem called ""The Last Battle"", by Unknown:   If it should be that I grow frail and weak   And pain should keep me from my sleep,   Then will you do what must be done,   For this — the last battle — can't be won.   You will be sad I understand,   But don't let grief then stay your hand,   For on this day, more than the rest,   Your love and friendship must stand the test.  We have had so many happy years,   You wouldn't want me to suffer so.   When the time comes, please, let me go.   Take me to where to my needs they'll tend,   Only, stay with me till the end   And hold me firm and speak to me   Until my eyes no longer see.  I know in time you will agree   It is a kindness you do to me.   Although my tail its last has waved,   From pain and suffering I have been saved.   Don't grieve that it must be you   Who has to decide this thing to do;   We've been so close — we two — these years,   Don't let your heart hold any tears.  — Unknown"

Really. Idk what the fuck am I subscribed to but my front page is so negative all the time. I’m glad to see something like that
Made me smile. As a shorter guy myself, picking me up has been a way for people in my past to prove how alpha they are. But this looks totally different and the gesture is really nice.
They probably see each other a lot in all the Championships.
And that’s why they can win medals for physical sports, and you aren’t
Figure skaters get pretty buff. Takes a lot more out of you to skate like that than most people think.  Plus the men are usually tossing the women up into the air during routines, so obviously you'd need some arm lifting power to do that.
So he is surrounded by GIANTS
That's why I subscribed to a bunch of positive subs like r/wholesomememes , cause the negativity can really drag you down. Now my front page has a lot more random cute puppers and memes spreading positivity on my way
Oooooh so that’s the reason?
Yes. He is not short, it's just that the average height of pairs men skaters are 180-190cm lol
My personal feed is clogged by wholesomememes and awww for this exact reason. Gotta go for the pick me ups!
Wait 170cm is not short?  Someone tell the girls...QUICK!
Aww has been posting SO much lately, I’m getting into a territory where I’m almost too happy.
It's a fucking shame that the parents who raised an excellent son don't get to see the man he would grow to be.
for anyone curious for more information: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaevion_Dobson   he saved two girls from gunfire from a random drive by shooting.
Hell yeah! Todd Kelly Jr for UT football repped his number (24) in honor. I live Knoxville, a lot of people I worked with went to school with him and said the guy was a real stand up kid. The fact that someone in such a situation would jump in front of someone while gun shots are going off just shows the character and bravery in someone. A true hero. 
I'm not sure I believe in God, but I sure hope there is something amazing waiting for people like him after death. 
I went to school in the same area as Zaevion. My school faced theirs all the time, had a decent rivalry going. He was a great kid and would have made the world a better place. The girls he protected live every day thanking him.  Unfortunately, my local news did try to paint him in a bad light because he was black for a minute until the truth came out.
What a great kid, his parents must’ve raised him well 
A hero !
Drove on the Zaevion Dobson memorial bridge for the first time last month. Took me by surprise and bought me to tears, glad my city finally did something right by memorializing him like that. 
God Bless your soul eternally, Zavion
Here's his school getting a new weight gym in his honor. He's got a mural up on the wall in the gym. https://youtu.be/y9JcAZNlcWc
I remember when Zaevion was honored with the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs. His mother’s speech made me cry. May he rest in peace.
Check out the video of the police chief after the shooting.  Zaevion is a hero and has impacted many people with his selfless action.  [http://www.espn.com/espn/story/\_/id/14395564/tennessee-high-school-football-player-zaevion-william-dobson-killed-shielding-girls-gunfire](http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/14395564/tennessee-high-school-football-player-zaevion-william-dobson-killed-shielding-girls-gunfire)
This deserves more publicity. 
 I am 34 and I am half the man he is.
I live about 30 minutes from knoxville. I remember this story like it was yesterday. True hero! 
RIP Zae. #24Strong
He seemed like a great kid. It's heartbreaking. I feel so bad for the family. The following year, [his 12 year old cousin was also killed in a gang shooting]( https://newschannel9.com/news/local/zaevion-dobsons-12-year-old-cousin-killed-in-knoxville-gang-shooting). Absolutely awful. 
It hit the community here in Knoxville hard when it happened.  We actually have his picture and jersey on the wall of the store I work in.
Now your name makes sense. 🙋🏻‍♀️ neighbor
My heart is utterly broken for his family, particularly his mother.
He was a wonderful kid. I went to WBHS and even a few people there were greatly affected by his loss.
A&E? Catholic? Maryville? Central?  Any can you source your second statement? I'm an alumni of Zaes high school and cant recall a single news station doing such.
He was black for only a minute?
Seriously. This is human being a hero, not just a bro.
*Zaevion
It happened in 2015, he received the Arthur Ashe courage award at the Espys in 2016. 
Shut your stupid tea drinking, queen loving, crumpet snorting ass up. You fucking donkey mouth.
 https://i.imgur.com/CqEClUX.jpg 
mate really?  he died, the girls lived if he didn’t take the bullet, they woulda died come on mate
I think you’re confusing bullet velocity with the ability to aim. His body on top of those girls is why those girls are alive. He was in its direct path to the girls. 
WBHS! Everyone always got pumped playing against Fulton.  I don't have sourcing, just remember seeing something about him smoking pot or something, and a few people at/from school mentioning it. I think it went around facebook a bit, too. But this was a while back now and Blount County is known for being racist.
No idea why you're getting downvoted. Have an upvote for getting his name right.
well....kinda.  So the cop during parkland did indeed hide but I don't think there was any media calling him a hero. Most of it as a pretty angry outcry.  
No. There is no set path that bullets take. If it hit a bone it would bounce. If it was a hollow point it would be slowed down by everything in its path i.e. walls, clothing, flesh, etc. Its not as simple as any bullet larger than a 9mm will go through a person. I don't know what weapon was used but it likely wasnt larger than a 9mm anyway. 
I’ve done this with furniture on CL and NextDoor. Post it for $125. Some family shows up in a falling apart mini van and 5 kids. I help them load it up and then refuse their money.   Edit:  I wanted to add that in my area posting stuff for free attracts a lot of flippers. I try to post stuff for a reasonable price and then assess the situation. It’s not always trying to help someone who is struggling either. Sometimes it’s if the person is really cool or if the item I’m selling holds sentimental value to me sometimes I can tell the buyer is the kind of person I want to have it. E.g. years ago I sold a pair of Klipsch La Scalas. I had them listed for $1000. A guy came with his wife and wanted to demo them. We chatted for a long time and listened to music. He had similar tastes to me and just seemed like a nice guy. I’m an audiophile hobbiest who rotates through gear from time to time but the La Scalas seemed like bucket list gear to him. At the end he goes, “OK, I’ll take them. You said $1000 right?”  I said “tell you what, I’ll take $800.”  He was gobsmacked.   I’m much more likely to waive more necessity items. My wife had refused money when she’s listed our old baby items as well. 
"I thought that said ""my mom"" not ""a mom"" and that changes the entire story"
Difference between r/HumansBeingBros and r/ChoosingBeggars is the gratitude receivers show when something nice happens to them.
I had a husband and wife show up to buy an awesome fridge. The ad was for $600 for the fridge. She offered $500 which I accepted.   When they came to pick up the fridge I noticed they were a newly wed with a small child so when she gave me $500 I handed her back $100 and then proceeded to give them a microwave, crock pot, and George Foreman Grill that I was going to sell. They were beyond happy and thankful. It’s good to help out those less fortunate when you know they aren’t choosy beggars. 
Head over to /flipping or /eBay and usually get an email like this everyday with a depressing story . 9 out of 10 times they are lying so be cautious always.   Years ago some woman bought eye drops near expiration time said she was running some weird African foundation for eyes or glasses maybe ?  Googled her and she had some website up that looked it was from 1999 so sent her 100’s of the eyedrops and she emailed back pics months later with several happy African kids.  
Thank you. We need more of you. Are you available for cloning? 💙
First off, thank you for being so selfless!  I have a few similar stories but the one id like to tell is actually how someone helped my family.  We were a family of four (plus one on the way) living solely off my petty income.  I had recently lost my job in finance and was working as a warehouse worker.  We had just lost our vehicle and did not have the means at the time to get another one.  I listed what belongings I had on craigslist, which wasn’t much but hopefully enough to make a down payment at a buy here pay here lot. I had this trek bicycle which was in pretty good shape but not worth more than maybe $300.   Being fairly desperate at the time, I posted it for $280 then dropped to $260. I only had one bite, a gentleman offering $200 flat. With very limited options at the time, I accepted the offer and provided my address.  The gentleman shows up, and we have a little chat about the bike and why I was selling it.  I told him that we needed to find a vehicle that would transport five people, three of which would be in car seats, and how buy here pay here was looking to be our only option.  He asked a very strange question, “do you have a pediatrician for your children?“ This threw me off, but I answered that since we had recently went on State insurance, most pediatrician offices were not excepting patients with that coverage.  He then pulls out his wallet, hand me the full $260 stating that he felt really bad for talking me down, and then hands me his business card. He was indeed a pediatrician from one of the most respectable pediatric offices in our area.  He promised (and followed through) that he could get my kids accepted as patients. But he went one step further in a way that blew my mind...  He offered for us to come to his house, and look at this old minivan that he had and would be willing to give us a good deal on it. The next day we found a ride and went by without expecting much, specially when we pulled in and saw that it was actually quite a nice looking van. It was an early 2000’s model Chrysler Voyager.  We started it up, drove around the neighborhood a little bit and sort of a few minor issues it was perfect for us and exactly what we needed. When we pulled into the driveway, he and his wife were standing out front with the title already signed over to us as a gift for zero dollars.  I can’t begin to tell you what that did for my family, not only financially but mentally and spiritually as well. There are still great people in this world, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 
opposite of choosing beggars?
Don't know if this is true or not. And to be frank, i don't really care. There is so much buzz & hate everywhere, so thank you for a nice story OP. 
Did something similar with a oven/range I was replacing. It was in 100% working order and only ~5 years old, but I bought a nicer model and listed it on CL for $150. Got a call asking if I could hold it for a couple weeks while they got the money together because theirs had died a few weeks prior.   I told em if they could pick it up, it was theirs for free. $150 doesn't really mean much to me, but clearly for them it was a lot of money. 
My parents do the same thing every time they post stuff on craigslist. And they will never take the agreed price. When the people get there my parents lower the price voluntarily.
My mom had a garage sale - there was a young girl who was playing with one of my brothers and my old toys. Watching her play with it made me remember how cool it was and I just had a flood of great memories. My brother and I sat down with her and showed her some of the things you could do with it while her mom looked around.   When it was time to go, her mom said that she needed to leave the toy - it seemed like money was an issue, but damnit we wanted her to have it! So, my brother and I packed it back up, grabbed a few other things we saw the kid eye and ran to catch up with them. The mom was a little embarrassed but when we explained that it meant a lot to us to see her appreciate things we had loved, she let us give the kid the toys. It felt so good! I liked knowing a really nice kid was going to have my old toys - it was so much better than the few bucks we would have made.
What a lovely thing to do. 
Had a yard sale once and was selling a full sized bed with frame and some nice clothing and coats of varying sizes. A slightly frazzled single woman with three small children showed up looking at the clothing and was interested in the bed but didn’t have much money. I gave her the bed for free and all the clothing she thought she could use for a few dollars. The only reason I took her money is because I could tell that for her, it was a “dignity” thing. I lost nothing that was of any value to me any longer and she was so grateful, especially for the bed.   Same yard sale and a smug woman was looking at a winter coat, brand new never worn with the store tags still on it and priced at $1. She offered me .25 and acted like it was a generous offer on her part. I would have thrown that coat away in the garbage before selling it that arrogant bitch. It went home with the frazzled single mom with three kids.
Me too! Lmao poor guy.
There's no sense of entitlement, being grateful and asking for a favor expecting nothing is a lot different than going into something thinking you deserve what you want. 
/r/ChoosingBeggars seems like such a funny sub on the surface, but when you dive into it it's a really weird place.
U a good dude
So how did that thought process go when you realized she was telling the truth? “Well damn turns out crazy eye drop lady is legit”?
I thought you said “clothing” for a second and were tryin’ to get 30 pairs of clothes hehe
Do you feel it’s because they actually are, or are you saying that you think people are lying to get a deal? I have no clue if that’s how it works on eBay, so just curious.
That’s why you need to put a price on it though because good people who need the deal will be trying to pay you. 
Quite different than what happens to me. Someone spends 2 days haggling then shows up with less than agreed and says “is this cool?” 
It doesn’t even sound like the mom asked for a favour. Rather “omg my son loves them so much I wish I could have bought them all.”  
>/r/ChoosingBeggars seems like such a funny sub on the surface, but when you dive into it it's a really ~~weird~~ SAD place.  
u/clevelandsteamer81 making us feel warm inside 
Never thought of it that way, but makes perfect sense! 
I was looking to buy a cello because I’d gotten a new job teaching strings at a school. I’m a violinist but wanted to be as good at teaching cello, too.   I responded to an ad without a price. I offered that I could afford $200. He replied saying he was hoping for more because he’d put a lot of money into repairs. We agreed on a payment plan for an amount closer to what he’d wanted and I went to take it home with the $200 deposit.  A few days later, I got an email from him and I was certain he’d changed his mind and would want the cello back. Instead, it was him telling me to forget about the payments and to keep the cello and focus on teaching. I cried like a baby. 
*laughs through nose
Otherwise you run the risk of giving it to someone that's just looking to turn a buck. Good call aye. 
"Same with pets. People put fees and regularly waive them because other less scrupulous assholes will see a free cat or puppy and go ""hey, snake food for the week!"" so people put a price up and it weeds out the non serious people."
Got my cat for free off Craigslist 10 years ago. I hated cats, but my wife loved them and really wanted one.  She follows me around everywhere I go and sleeps on my stomach every night. I don’t hate cats anymore.
I’ll never forget when I was a nursing student at my emergency department placement. Had an older woman whose bowels perforated and we all knew there was no way she was going to make it with her age and frail health. We called all NOK telling them her time was now, none of them could make it - due to them being at work/not having a babysitter/etc.  The nursing staff ended up dimming the lights, holding her hand, and soothing her until she passed away in an ED bed surrounded by strangers.
I was involved in this program during college. Worked in a hospice clinic. If you’re planning on volunteering, please greatly consider what you’re getting into. It’s definitely not for everyone. Can’t forget some of those people and their stories.
How do I volunteer to get involved?
I was with my best friend when they died and what these volunteers are doing is beautiful. But if your loved one dies alone you shouldn't feel guilty about it. Sometimes it seems like people choose to let go when their loved ones are not in the room. I think my friend found it easier to go when it was just me rather than their spouse and immediate family who had been there most of the time.  https://www.pallimed.org/2016/03/time-of-death-some-patients-prefer-to.html?m=1
Paging SCP-4999...
Are you serious? Would their bosses care? Could you not bring your kid either? I'm sure they would understand
Is your dad in a home, or are you thinking about the possibility of him being in a home?
My mom worked in hospice care for years when I was in school and she’s probably going to go back when my sister is out of the house. As much as I would love to say that I have the strength to sit with people in their last moments, I know I don’t. I watched my mom do it with grace for years and I don’t know how she did it.
Call your local hospitals. They have all kinds of volunteers.
This is what makes me grateful that my father got to die in home hospice. As it turned out, my mother was awake and with him when he died, but my brother and I (and the dogs) were asleep upstairs, but he wasn't _alone_ regardless.  Being by yourself in a room in a place where people care for you is just privacy, not being alone.
I feel like I'm one of few who would feel okay with that. I mean sure it's sad that no one you know could be there, but at the same time, I think I'd be happy around the people who would want to be by my side - even if it's just nurses. Besides there's no need for my family to see me die right in front of them.
Hell yeah
We don't like to think about it but this lady might have been a monster to her children so they didn't want to be heard or seen celebrating.
I know it's not very wholesome, but maybe this old woman was not very nice to her family, and when the nurse called they gave them a bullshit excuse instead of the whole family drama.  I just refuse to believe you wouldn't be there, if you cared.
I was looking for programs like this after seeing that Askreddit post about the lady who originally just volunteered for normal duties in hospice care. After a few weeks she saw what patients wanted the most and now goes to people in their last days in care and asks them if they want someone to spend time with them.    After getting to know the person she asks if they want her to record their stories for them on her laptop. The majority say yes and she lets them  drive  the conversation in whatever direction they want. If they want an autobiography of their life or just to reminisce on stories they’ve held onto over the years. She said it comforts patients to know that they won’t be forgotten once they pass, I don’t think she said it was closure but it definitely helped ease some people   I never asked  what she does with her typed/ audio recorded conversations but I think It’d be a really lovely gift to send to family members/ loved ones who couldn’t be there for whatever reason. Especially if stories the patient told involved them in any way. Or if they just want to tell their family members how much they really loved them.   Another question I wanted to ask is if she actually stays with them in their last moments. I would hope I’m strong enough to do that, and after being in the ICU as much as I was as a kid, the hospital setting isn’t overbearing for me. I’m gonna do it
It can't be easy on the nurses, either. That would take such a toll on you.
nurse here. plenty of older people are completely estranged from their family, whether it is due to them not having anybody, no children, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, mental health issues, or just being a very salty person.   Guy off the street dies and his only company are 2 people off the street as well. Only thing they ask after he passes is if he has any money in his pockets.
Oh no, I'm so sorry. I lost my dad to Alzheimer's disease last year. He was in a memory care facility. I hope you have someone to talk to, you can send me a PM any time if not. Or even if you do. Remember to take care of yourself, too.
My grandma, the mother of my step dad had Alzheimer's as well. She passed away last year as well. What was most heartbreaking was I was the one she had forgotten last despite not being related by blood. Alzheimer's is a nasty disease man.. though if you wanna help support it you may wanna check Curiosity Box if you like nerdy toys. They put a chunk into Alzheimer's research in return to giving you science toys to learn or mess around with
I worked with AIDS patients back in the bad old days when everyone died from it, and sat with, held, was with a number of patients as they died... those whose families had disowned them or just had no one. I also was with my brother, my mother, and grandmother when they died on separate occasions.         It's not easy stuff. But it's... big. In a hard and a good way.  It puts everything in perspective and you're a different person for having been there and been there for someone in that way.       It reminds you how precious every day is and maybe even every breath. More time is something many people seem to wish for with a terminal diagnosis, but during those last minutes the only thing that seems important to them and those with them is that they know they're not alone and they are cared about.       They matter.       I hope I'm as brave, poised, and gracious when my time comes as those I've been with.       My wife is a healthcare worker from a family of doctors and she says it's the greatest gift you can give someone, to invite them to be a part of your last moments. I imagine that's true, but I can say for sure I feel honored that I was allowed to help in some way.      Edit: Thanks for the responses, and I'm really touched that some were touched by my words. If anyone is interested, I'm planning on doing up a blog or maybe a podcast of stories about life and death. Send a PM if interested.
You can instantly tell this teacher is one of the good ones
20 years on his old Jordans, damn
I love that this is a thing that is popular to do
Someone edit this so a beam of light shines out when he opens the box
I’ve had Mr Blakey for 4 years now, he’s the best teacher I’ve ever encountered. He knows his students better than any other, and can relate to them easily. Much love for Blakey!! Also his shoes (bred 13s) got so worn out because he would always lent them out at his previous school. Shows how much he cars about the kids Edit: thanks for silver !!
I’m a gym teacher, can confirm we can’t afford new shoes 
[link to the original video ](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrvslzYhukG/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=112kgucko92wo) 
Gosh this has me thinking  about my middle school gym teachers. I swear those guys were so good to their students. I can't thank them enough for helping me through tuff times and making me understand I was a kid and everything in life will work out.
Kids really are the best. Look at the *pure joy* they get out of **giving**. I’m in tears watching them be so unbelievably happy to give their teacher something they knew he’d appreciate.
Just fell in love and planned the rest of my life with this gym teacher. 
Edmonton?
Wholesome posts like this is the reason i love reddit more than any other social apps
The group hug at the end was the cherry on top. These types of teachers/role models have an impact on lives that live well beyond their own existence
Yeah, a teacher that actually cares about his students !!! 
Definitely got the good dude vibe from him. Need more of them teaching.
Yeah I don't get how he's gone that long on one pair of soles
The article says they only lasted five years because he would let students wear them if they asked. But there were his first and only pair of Jordan’s. 
I hate when people say you shouldn't record these moments. These wholesome videos make others to think about it and do the same thing. Why encouraging others is a bad thing 
Proud of my generation 
I'll take your whole stock
Can we get some angelic choir sounds with that?
Thats so great, so wonderful, is he single?
I'm a middle aged man, can confirm we don't replace clothing until absolutely necessary, even then...
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/etobicoke-high-school-students-surprise-teacher-with-jordans-1.4953679  Link to an article about the teacher and kids. Very cute and heart warming.
Love you Coach Zilla. Never got the opportunity to thank you as a man. 
MOST teachers care about their students. its just you hear so much about those few bad apples...
my middle school PE teachers (there were 3 of them that all taught class together) pretty much got paid to make fun of 12 year-olds and also scream in the faces of 12 year olds.
that's how high school teaching in the US works, by all accounts.
You could call him an old sole
"You can't have everything with these people. If not that, they would've found something else. The question that needs to be asked is ""Would it have been better if it had not happened?"". And in cases like these, almost all the time, the answer is no. "
GROUP HUG! GROUP HUG!
Hahaha nope got a wife and kids
Am 34 and still wear some clothes from high school, can confirm
And he's wearing a Golden Bears sweater. If he's in Edmonton he's probably doing well for himself.
Legends all round. Good for everyone.
Yooo I know a Coach Zilla who wore that name on the back of his sweatshirt. Your grow up in Northern California? 
Damn, coach is reppin UofA on his hoodie 
> its just you hear so much about those few bad apples...  I feel like this isn't true. I see/hear a lot about teachers going above and beyond their duties. 
"Can confirm. Mother is a teacher, 35 years, close to retirement. Not a gym teacher but still a wonderful and loving one. This is becoming ""a thing"" and I'm sooo grateful. She deserves it and so does this gym teacher.  When he started looking like he was about to cry? Something about a grown man crying... kills me every time. "
"I believe the great philosopher T. A. Swift put it best.  ""Haters gonna hate"""

Can she not retire after just 25 years?
"Excuse me, but the **unabridged** version of T.A. Swift's dialectical method for establishing cyber-epistemological frameworks in the 21st century is as follows:  > ""the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate""  FIVE HATES.   Following that, she continues  > ""Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake I shake it off, I shake it off""  It is only at this point that we can truly understand Swift's position in it's entirety. She not only observes the haters HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE but she also SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE before she SHAKE IT OFF and then SHAKE IT OFF again.  She posits this as a methodological antidote to the haters, and I am inclined to agree. Five hates, five shakes, two extra shake it offs for good measure and we're good to go."
Hahaha nope got a husband and kids
What school? That's my zip code and my dad grew up going to school in the same one! Small world
My psycho stepmother was a much loved kindergarten teacher.  Still weirds me out.
Not if she wants to survive. Where I’m from teachers start at 22-24k. They’re up to 32k in less than five years, usually, but still....  Edit:  Ofc, compared to the national avg, the rates I posted above are exceptionally low.
but r u single? 😢
In Australia I made more than that washing dishes 😯
You can make more washing dishes in the US, too.  It works out to be ~$11/hr if they take payments throughout the entire year instead of just the school year which would be ~$15. There are a lot of dishwashing jobs in either price points, and Target is starting at $15 come end of January (I believe) in addition to most other large retailers or brands that employ anyone with a pulse.
Sadly we don't value education anymore. Far too often its mocked and ridiculed instead of being admired and respected.  If we don't value educated people, why would we pay people who educate others?   Dont even get me started on vouchers... 
More than one hero sitting at your table. 
My friends and i will frequently tell the server it's ok to seat someone with us if the circumstance is right. Have met some fun people that way!
This happened in Louisville Ky for anyone wondering. 
This makes me happy!!
Here in Charleston, many restaurants have long tables called community tables. It's a good way to get a seat at a table without having to wait for one to open up because you seat yourself.  I enjoy sitting at them because the people that sit there tend to be very friendly and chatty. Charleston is a bit of a tourist destination, so I've met a lot of people with interesting backgrounds sitting at these tables.
He looks like Morty Seinfeld.
I like to think of myself as the type of person who would do this. But, to be 100% honest, I probably wouldn’t have even noticed there was a lonely guy looking for a place to sit.   Note to self:  be more aware of your surroundings and look for an opportunity to be a “bro”
Is anyone else weirded out by photos being attached to these stories?? I mean yeah, it “proves” that it happened, and it IS a wonderful story to tell and teach about kindness but I’d be super weirded out knowing my candid photo was somewhere cause someone wanted to show off the situation. I’d honestly be even more weirded out if they asked me to post a candid... Just ask him for a nice smiley posed shot and call it a day.  Edit: word tense. AND,  I’m not saying these things shouldn’t be posted. I believe they are very positive and inspire further good acts, albeit in a slightly cheesy way. Post away! I’m only commenting on the posts like this that have candid/sneakily-taken photos of the people they’re “helping” or being kind to. Just seems weird to post that instead of asking them for a posed photo in my opinion. You can tell the difference between when they know you’re taking the photo/video and not like this one.  Edit 2: I repeat... I’m not saying posting this stuff is bad. This is about the photos used in the posts.
Go BLUE! Michigan Man through and through!
I want to shake these guys’ hands and buy them a beer.
That kids going to grow up well with such a great dad. Very wholesome!
I went to some tiny diner I saw on Diner Driveins and Dives in Syracuse, and they just had big long tables for about 6-8 that you would sit at with another group if you didnt have enough people to fill it.   I was hungover and really didnt feel like socializing but it ended up being really cool to sit and talk with some randoms for breakfast 
Yup. I used to work with dude in the Michigan hat
This makes me want Roosters. Not in a HailCorporate kinda way, I just really like Roosters and this post made me realize I haven't been in a while.
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.
"I completely get where you're coming from, and I personally hate the videos people take of themselves carrying out good deeds. But you know, there might actually be something to it.     I was walking home Friday evening through a rougher part of town where there's a lot of rough sleepers, and noticed a group of kids crowded around one of them. My mind instantly went to ""Oh shit, I hope they're not tormenting him"" and I crossed the road to get closer to what was going on. I was thinking I'd have to call out the kids and eat a few punches so wasn't particularly looking forward to it, but as I got closer they were delivering him some food from a nearby takeaway. No phones in sight. Walking off I heard them all congratulate each other - ""I only had about 50p, I'd have given him more if I could."" ""Nah mate, you did good, we all helped innit?"".     As cringeworthy as I might find it, maybe it does actually inspire other people or at least younger people to take action."
Dads like this add so much to their children's perspectives.   
Was it mother's cupboard.    
I went to college with him!
Looking at the pictures I'm 99% sure that's it. They had like a 5 pound frittata, that was not just big but delicious.  I grew up on frittata so it was pretty awesome, not many places I've been to where you can get that.  You live in Cuse? 
Was he this cool?! 
More reason for you to be that dude. Even if you never have a kid, you never know what an act of kindness can do for a stranger. Hell I've had comments on Reddit cheer me up on some really rough days. 
This is definitely something he’d do.  He was good at engaging with strangers and making friends.  Good guy.
Am I the only one here that doesn’t know this man?! 
r/tworedditorsonecup
I don't know about anyone else but back in the day the skating community always helped me out. I thought when trying to skate I was going to get picked on cause I didn't know shit but opposite happened. Everyone helped and taught me new tricks. I grew out of it like 5 years later but I still have those friends today and that was 15 years ago. Anyways glad to see much hasn't changed.
That's really adorable..and I love that they cheered when he did it! Safety gear/helmets aside that was really nice for them to support that kid. I love seeing people learn new things with the help of others. :)
Shit like this makes me love people. Not all folks are assholes.
Geez. My fellow skateboarders were not this supportive in 1987...  “It’ll work.... or it won’t, you’ll lose some teeth and know what not to do next time”   Was the advice I got BITD
What a cool, supportive community.
i love that even the older more experienced guys were helping too. At my local skate park they are all high as a kite throwing their boards across the park when they mess up.
The skating culture is the complete opposite of picking on each other. Everyone was always so friendly, even the sponsored ones
I found this when I started rock climbing. Terrified I would get ridiculed for not being strong enough the exact opposite happened. All the crushers came together and gave me advice and rooted me on when I would try climbs. It was a really really nice moment and made me want to continue the sport. Sometimes people are awesome and just want to see you succeed.
The skating community is awesome for this kind of stuff in general. Go to any skate park as a complete novice and the majority of the experienced guys there will take the time out of their day to help you, support you and teach you techniques. No judgment, no elitism. Just a friendly and welcoming community.
Never mistake for assholery what can be easily attributed to raging stupidity.
I guess there’s just two kinds of people in this world. My kind of people, and assholes.
Was thinking the exact same thing. Man... I'm old.
Idk, [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0-bbt9Pq5c)  seems pretty hostile.
My son used to be a skater. When he was in high school, more than once, he would bring home homeless kids down on their luck that would hang out at the park. He always felt bad for them and wanted to help. I finally had to have a talk with him and direct him to a local homeless shelter where they could provide more help than we could. Plus I didn’t know these kids, I was empathetic towards their situation, but I had a younger daughter at home and needed to think about her safety as well.
This is not true everywhere, as I’ve been to a lot of parks where people either ignore or shit on novices for “getting in their way”.
I seem to be somewhere in the middle: young because I didn't notice this but old enough to agree with you!
Man I love that video but I was hoping this was some Mike V videos!  Edit:   #WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT:   https://youtu.be/52kfypohGPM
Yeah... When I was younger I broke my arm while playing with friends. I was my about 20 minutes walking distance from my house, and I was young enough that I didn't have a phone. So my friends asked a group of older skater kids to call my parents, and they said no :(
Those are just bad people.
“All skater kids will help”  >one doesn’t help  “All TRUE skater kids will help”
That dog is happy and healthy now, u gave her a new life that's so awesome
Oh my heart. What a transformation.
I was like „how they gonna clean that fu — aaaaaaah“
Such a good human.
She is beautiful.
If the puppies are happy, then I am happy!
OMG yes I'm so happy she finally has the life she deserves
I keep seeing people say dogs are to good for us humans but once in a while we see evidence that there are people who are good enough to deserve the love dogs give.
I love how she snuggled under that blanket so happily.
Awesome for sure, she now has a caring owner
A ton of people in China are becoming dog lovers it's awesome, when I visited I see so many people walking their puppers in parks, I think animal rights are getting more attention with the new generation.
> Oh my heart.  My exact thoughts word for word. The first clip where her hair started growing back and you could see her becoming healthy again...so pure.
nobody would come near me - said they didn't like the 'smell'  but You could see, so clearly, i was Good, n you could tell  that all i really needed was someone to make me whole,  with patient love, you feeded both my body n my soul  now what a transformation! i have started life anew  an *internet sensation*, n it's all because of You!  a Cinderella story, true  - a happy ever end  the story titled *Me & You* -  you're my Forever friend  ❤️
People who rescue animals like this are what Angels would be to us.  Imagine being alone and sick, starving, and then this unfathomable creature comes, and inexplicably starts helping you.  Makes you safe, gives you food, heals your wounds.
A heartwarming transformation for sure
Dude that after coat though came in prime. So clean and soft looking I want to pet it 😍😍
Probably felt sooooo good for that pup to get all that fur off!
I didn't expect that bald little shaved face, so ugly it's cute
My favorite compilation of humans being good. https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=48s
That doggo smile is so wonderful!
It's really nice to know that there is still people out there willing to help
Imagine how great the world would be if we were angels to each other.
Heartworming transformation too, probably
I was pleasantly surprised how well it grew back after shaving!
I am a groomer and I had a little poodle yesterday who was very matted. There were even a few pulling at his skin! 😢 Got him clipped short though so he's at least free of the mattes now! You can definitely tell they feel better afterwards and that they know that you helped them.
"Had that face like, ""I trusted you. Yeah, yeah, I know it's gonna make me feel better, but this sucks."""
In every disaster whether it's natural or not, always look for the helpers.  The people looking to help always outnumber the ones who cause the problems. People are inheritly good but good people don't get views for articles or news channels so you don't hear about them as much.
Animals don't lie or have ill intentions so it's easier to be an angel for them.
It usually does grow back beautifully! There are absolutely some cases where it doesn't, but I've seen many doggos with absolutely God awful cases of mange, waayyyy worse than this baby's, and the hair grows back beautifully and there isn't a hint that they ever even had mange. It's really incredible.
I agree with this.  I was raised in an emotionally neglectful home, and immediately got out and married in succession two abusive men.  Both my home growing up and in my marriages, all I heard about was how terrible the world was, how awful people are, and how I'd better not leave my abusive family (birth and in-laws), because the world would be so much worse to me than any of them were.  Well, I did get out.  I went no-contact with my abusive family, and I divorced my 2nd husband and went no-contact with his family.  I was ready to live the rest of my life alone rather than be abused any more.  However, I was questioning everything that I had been taught, and decided to question their views on other people.  I'm happy to report that I have found them to be utterly and completely wrong.  There are so many good people out there, who genuinely care about other people.  And no - the secret isn't to belong to some religion or other group.  No one group has a monopoly on goodness.  These good people are everywhere, in every size and shape and from every background.  Bad people get attention, and that's why things seem bleak.  Of course our world isn't perfect, but we have good people out there trying to make it better.  And it IS getting better.  Keep on keepin' on, good folks, and thank you.
"Should we only be angels to people who deserve it, then?  Or is it truly angelic to be excellent to each other regardless of ""worthiness""?"
Giving back sacred antiquities to their rightful owners is one the coolest acts of philanthropy I can think of. Not that many other forms of philanthropy are less than worthy, just this type specifically is on its own level.
I knew a woman once, Sandra Speiden, who did the same thing. She was browsing an estate auction 1986 and came upon a peace pipe. She was not of native blood but she told me later that it spoke to her, so she bought it. She never told me how much she paid for it.  Years of research later, she believed that the pipe was made by Sitting Bull himself and that the pipe should be returned to his family. She located his great-great-great grandson, and it turned out he was going to be in Washington DC for the grand opening celebration of the National Museum of the American Indian.  She met him there and presented the pipe to him, and it was determined that it was, in fact, a pipe made by Sitting Bull. He requested that she present the pipe to the Lakota nation during the opening ceremony of the annual 300-mile horseback Big Foot Memorial Ride to Wounded Knee. During the ceremony, she was gifted a star quilt. She became very ill and was hospitalized during the ride and didn't complete it, unfortunately, but came home with a hell of a story.  Sometimes I really miss my friend. We would ride for hours in the foothills of the Blue Ridge and she'd have so many stories...she really lived a full life.
Most likely out of Pipestone Minnesota, they take their pipes serious. The bowl piece is a specific type of stone that i believe can only be found in that area, the right piece is normally made from wood, it just twists on, resin gives it a solid connection after use.  Used to have one that was given to me but it got stolen.
This made me all warm and fuzzy inside
Cultural re-appropriation!  Sticking it to the man.  Put *that* in your pipe and smoke it.
Put that thing back where it came from me or so help me
I hope they smoked some good shit in the peace pipe with the person that returned it.
I wish I had enough money where I could spare $40k just to do something good with it. Bless whoever the buyer was.
This is somewhat off topic, but this made me think of a video by Kento Bento about how rich Chinese sponsors would sponsor art thieves to get back ancient Chinese artwork such as pottery, paintings, and antiques from parts of Western Europe being displayed in Museums and Universities. I think this is also one of the most bad ass ways to recover priceless treasures of one’s culture  Link to video if anyone would like to check it out  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9LDVQYfeseo
My grandpa spent his whole life in Pipestone and accumulated one of the largest collections of peace pipes throughout his life. When he passed he had his entire collection donated to the museum.
Hi
Serious question: Couldn't the country's government ask for the item back, assuming it was found on their soil?  It seems logical to me, but I'm assuming it's a *lot* more complicated than I think.
Damn you inside that dude
I mean, “returned to China” doesn’t necessarily mean “returned to the Chinese *Public*”. Could just as easily be sitting around in said Rich Guy’s second home as a conversation piece
No it’s actually very hard to get art or historical artifacts back. For example the famous bust of Nefertiti was ‘exported’ to Germany in a box that Egyptian officials at the time claimed they never saw what was inside. Unlike the UK where they at least make excuses as to why they can’t return certain pieces (etc too fragile to be transported), Germany just flat out refuses.
Arguably, that's worse than sitting in a foreign museum.
"Egypt: ""Hey, that's ours! Give it back!""  Germany: ""Hahahaha, no."""
Yes because in a lot of cases  The country of origin doesn't have proper facilities to care for these ancient artifacts.   How would you feel if you sent back an artifact thats 8000 years old and it got destroyed due to an unstable political climate?
Yeah- at least then the public is benefiting- a public without as direct a connection with the piece but a public nonetheless
"""Hahahaha, nein."""
it shatters my heart to see what’s going on in Syria, but on another level what’s happening to the culture and architecture there. thousand year old cities like Damascus being reduced to rubble over a civil war
That’s true but the example I’m referring to is that Egypt is opening the Grand Egyptian Museum in 2020 with totally new facilities and will be the largest museum of Egyptian artifacts in the world. Egypt begged Germany to just loan the bust for the opening but Germany still said no lol
"""Nein."" We don't laugh in Germany."
Yeah but it belongs to Egypt...
The hongkongian protestors seem like such a wholesome bunch
People there seems to understand that a camera is a better weapon than a gun against the government
This is Sky News Presenter Jonathan Samuels. Whilst you’re here get over to /r/HongKong to keep up to date with what’s going on
I really hope that HK will be okay. The protestors are decent people : (
Here we see an entitled Chinese Millennial throwing shade at a reporter.
Please  can anyone tell me what I can do to support them?
We really need to always refer to them as *”pro-democracy protestors”*.    Most Americans and some apathetic Europeans don’t know what they are protesting for, we need to make it clear “these are the good guys.”
This man’s definitely a bro 👍🏼
China: HONG KONG PROTESTOR PREVENTS JOURNALIST FROM HAVING ACCESS TO WATER
They are
Out here, you got people chucking molotovs and beating the shit out of people.  Out there, you got people walking on the highway holding umbrellas.  Maybe the people here are doing it wrong.
They are. Last Monday one of my friends got stuck at the Hong Kong airport for nearly 24 hours and the only food available was distributed by the protesters
A camera is the best non violent weapon we have today I think.
Really curious how police and organizers are estimating crowd sizes for this one. This archived link (http://archive.vn/GsYhd) from the organizers indicates tens of thousands, but now the organizers are claiming 1.7 million.
Even if they successfully cancel the bill, the majority of their population will still be suffering from extreme inequality, which is one of the things thats driving the protest. Most of the developed world is undergoing the same problem though so it's a global issue.
Hong Kong protester denies water to innocent journalist.
violent hugs
Spread the news, explain to people around you about what is happening and why... we'd appreciate all these :)
"I refer all to the video of the protestors / average joes in the train getting beaten and the one man on his knees BEGGING for them to stop.  If you really think about it, that man and that video is something you may never actually see recreated in your own life. It's something I'd recommend Nasa send out on a satellite because it captures everything core in human nature.  The video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l31w5BR3qEw)   *if you'd like to skip triad bullying, go to 0:43  **sorry I haven't had the chance to reply, it is ^^^believed the ""goons"" are hired by the Chinese Govt but take that with a pinch of salt. There's violent people in every country both men and women who take any chance they can get to ruin everything for everyone but themselves. It's the human race that one sadly."
There's a difference between a riot and a protest.
"Modern day ""Pen is mightier than the sword"""
Guy goes down to return something to one of the attackers and after he does another one just sucker punches him... damn..
And at the very end he gets sucker punched.. what the fuck.
Cause im one of them
The pen may be mightier than the sword, but a camera can silence a thousand guns.
And the HK police arrive 39 mins after the first 999 (HK equivalent of 911) call, coincident?
It's horrible. Yet it's rife.  Imagine the Triad mentality in courts of law. Imagine if police officers were like that. Imagine if your entire future depended on someone with the same mentality as the sucker-punching Triad member?  That is what I believe to be the real reason for protest here.
Hot damn can I quote you on that?
Same way they left just a few min before. Coincidental lunch break for everyone.
 Though might sound better to say a single camera...  :)
Ah a little flavour, i like it
As a parent, I’m really sorry that you can’t have the basic love and support any child deserves to have. It’s great that you have someone in your life like this professor. Wishing you all the best and I hope you have a blast this New Years! 
Might I recommend a FB group for you?:  Stand-in families international.    There are tons of people, many who I’m sure are somewhat local, who will be there for you.  ❤️
That’s very sweet of your professor! It’s always sad when acquaintances are more compassionate than the family members who are supposed to love you and give you support.
Tennessee based supportive older sister here if you ever decide you want a sibling! Offer comes with a free brother in law, two adorable nieces, and a nephew.   EDITED TO ADD: Obligatory thanks for the gold (first time ever!) kind stranger! I was just selfishly nabbing myself a cool younger brother, didn't realize there would be bonus prizes. 
100% bro
Are you going to go?
Another Tennessee brother in Nashville should you need one. Also includes a fiesty, pregnant red head for a sister in law, THE most adorable 2 year old niece, and 2 bunny rabbits to cuddle with. May 2019 bring you more supportive family than you know what to do with!
Fuck yeah professor Jones and shit.   Sorry that religion gets in the way.  Real Christians love all people. 
Professors are seriously some of the kindest people you'll ever meet. Sorry to hear about your family situation, that really sucks. Hope you have fun at the party!
A small glimmer of hope. I love this. I hope you have a great time at the party!!!!!!!!
"I hate religious families that just disown their child because they love someone of the same sex. Make no damn sense to me. And yet I hate people who say ""Why do you care about gay pride and stuff if you aren't gay?"" Well I don't know let me ask my family. Should I ask my Pan cousin? Or my Bi sister first?"
Thank you! That means a lot☺️ I’m super excited for the new year, it’s going to be absolutely amazing!
I will definitely check it out, tysm!
Agreed! But I have honestly never been more thankful for someone☺️
Bruh I’m in TN too!!! 👀👀👀
100% agree!
100% brofessor 
Of course! 
Heck yeah man I’m in franklin! I’ll hit you up if I need a bro! (Or rabbits. I love rabbits) and same to u! Hope your 2019 is amazing!
I’m glad to hear you say that! I always love hearing people of religion who are accepting instead of anything else 😁
I mean I had listened to my mum go on about how terrible the LGBT community is for years and years so it didn’t surprise me in the slightest. I was pretty aware that it most likely would not go well, so I had kind of prepared myself for the worst and told her as I was about to leave for college so there wouldn’t b too much trouble since I’m already paying for my own tuition. Granted, not every religious family is the same as mine. I know plenty of people who’s folks were religious and, while it took them a few days/weeks to come around, they did and accepted and loved them. So all in all, it didn’t surprise me in the slightest, but I don’t think I would have been able to live with myself if I never told my mum. 
As a mom, I also want to say that I'm sorry your family failed you this way. The one job they had was to show you love unconditionally and they messed up. If you need a stand in mom, I'm a message away. Seriously. If you ever need a mom to talk to or miss your own, please send me a message. I have a ton of motherly love to give with zero conditions included and I am here for you. Perks include, but are not limited to:  Bad jokes.  Socks at Christmas.  Embarassing you in front of your friends with air  guitar/piano/drums/bass.  Free mom therapy and advice.  Cute bonus siblings.  Handmade crochet hats/scarves/washcloths etc.
I'll piggyback this with a recommendation for r/MomForAMinute, a similar reddit based community. 
You’re very welcome!  There are are so many kind people in this world that will help you feel less alone. 
I figured it out, OP  https://i.imgur.com/KR6WpQl.png  [You n'wah!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJD-Ufi1jGk) 
I caught that in a comment, couldn't resist throwing my hat in the ring. Particularly because I had to disown my mom because she's a nut job for unrelated reasons and you're getting awesome mom offers around here! Think we can petition to be adopted by someone else as a set?
Well let us know how it goes!
You have no idea how thankful I am for this! I actually teared up 😭 you are absolutely amazing thank you!!!!
r/MomForAMinute  People like you give me hope for the rest of us.
This is true! People can be the absolute best 😁
Yes! Dude u can so come with let’s do it!!
I will!
Hey no need to thank me! Message me any time!!
Hey....another mom here extending love and acceptance. Like the mom above, I am also a message away.   Your parents have no clue what they are missing. 
Oh! Can I be the snooping sister who keeps on trying to wingman you? Because I'm up for that!
As a Christian I don't believe in treating people badly in general. I have gay family members and friends, and don't understand how people who follow Jesus, who showed love to the outcasts and marginalized of society, would approve of rejecting a child for being gay.   May God bless you, and turn your family's hearts to acceptance. 
Also ask this man for a recommendation if you go to grad school. It's clear that he likes you enough to invite you to a family party, and it's clear that you respect him enough to go.
Socks at Christmas are pretty good now that I'm grown. Bonus points for wool.
Awww thank you so much!!! You guys are the absolute best!
YES!! I actually never met my sister(long story) so I’m so up for this
I plan on it! I was going to initially, but this just makes me want to all the more!
Wool socks are the bomb. 
Ugh, FINE.  I'll be your sarcastic, over-protective older sister, stop asking already!  Seriously, though, sending you internet hugs and wishing you the happiest of new years!  I'm sorry you don't have a relationship with your sister - I honestly can't imagine life without my little brother in it.  Here for you if you ever need it. 
I was invited to Christmas prime rib diner from one of my AA members. Was a great experience. Enjoy!
I'm always warm and they don't fit in my shoes though :(
Dude that’s awesome!! Glad it went well ☺️ and thank u!
She lost her eyesight in an acid attack.
Ms Greenlee (his Mom) has a domestic violence nonprofit, S.M.O.O.O.T.H. and it's amazing. They have a mission for empowering domestic violence survivors. Great family, I'd say.
Upvote for mom love. I don’t know what his father looks like, but he’s got his moms cheekbones.
This is so sweet! I wonder how many footballs shes got at home 🤔
"Two days ago I watched the highlights of their last game.  I saw him score and then run up to give the ball to some fan and honestly thought ""Why did he choose to give the ball to her?  The whole time she never even looked at him!  What a weird fan interaction.""  Damn do I feel like an ass now.  What an awesome thing."
Guess I'm always rooting for Hopkins now.
I wonder if the NFL still fines him the absurd amount that they fine players for doing this. If they do, they’re assholes and he’s even better for ignoring it.  Edit; Everyone’s telling me that they only fine you for throwing or kicking the ball into the stands; good to know.
DeAndre Hopkins is an absolutely elite level receiver, meaning you’re likely to see this happen in almost every game. Somehow I never knew he did this after his touchdowns, and I’ve seen a ton of them. Awesome.
*Everyone liked that*
Am a Houston fan. Couldn't be prouder of our guy. Tough as hell.
Yes there’s a long story about her, their relationship and how she was blinded on ESPN.com worth reading for anyone interested.
His family is marred by tragedy. His dad was killed in a car accident in 1992. His uncle was killed by police after attempting to kill his wife. Had a cousin die during a basketball game. Another cousin attempt suicide after falling in the depth chart at Clemson. And of course his mother who caught her cheating boyfriend in the act. Was attacked by the girl and the boyfriend dropped her off at a gas station. The attacker got 20 years.
Shit like this just infuriates me beyond belief. Take someone’s eyesight who DID NOTHING to you. Not ONE thing. And honestly it’s why I use caution now in all public places. People are out of their fucking minds and I want to personally say  even though yes sure he’s a millionaire nobody deserves this ever. His mom is obviously a very strong woman (her smile is still beautiful and they can’t take that from her!) God bless her
My college roommate was pretty active with S.M.O.O.O.T.H and I helped out at her bookbag drives a couple of times. She is a really fantastic person. The first time was during DeAndre's 2nd year with the Texans and he even came to help.
I'ma try and guess the acronym. Some Men Only Offer Ouchies, That Hurts
His father died in a car crash when DeAndre was only 5 months old. Dudes lived a hard life
Assuming she’s been to every NFL game of his that would be 53 balls
Almost as if many of our opinions are formed without full knowledge. The question then becomes, are we able to reform our opinions when new knowledge is available.   So congrats on being a good human when we are currently seeing many humans double down on their opinions despite the available contradictory evidence.
"You probably missed the game commentary. I only know because after his 2nd TD Joe Buck said ""and another ball for mom!"" as Hop was handing it to her"
Players don't get fined for handing out footballs... Only if they throw/kick the ball recklessly  into the stand is when they get fined.
Those bastards at ESPN.com got her too, eh?

http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/27793196/the-incredible-survival-story-deandre-hopkins-mom  > Greenlee woke up and saw that her car was missing; she quickly deduced that a man she had been dating for a few months had borrowed it without asking. When she showed up at an address the man had given her to retrieve the vehicle, he came out and started apologizing. Then a woman -- a stranger but presumably another one of his girlfriends -- ran out with a bucket of bleach mixed with lye.
You don't have to experience those things to not want those to happen & help others who experience it.
Now she has to devote a whole room in her house to his touchdown balls that she can’t use for anything else because they just keep coming! Will she ever catch a break :(
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
That’s a lot of balls

"Naw, that's awesome, we don't have the holders in Germany but we also do have the ""Pfand"" system which gives like 25cents for cans and plastic bottles and 8 for glass and hard plastic"
Might also add that a lot of times people will just place them on the ring  you can see around the trash can if there's no holders, or on top of the can if it's a different design.
Norway seems to do a lot of stuff right.
My friends and I were drinking in a park in Germany, with a little fire going. My friends where American. Now we had 2 cases of beer, at 24 bottles a case thats 48 cases and at at a value of 25 cents a bottle your talking 12 euros, its enough to get a simple meal. A homeless man came up to us and asked us if we wouldn't mind could he take the bottles when we were done.  I told him he could help us finish he beer and after we are done take the bottles and turn them in himself. He happily agreed at the chance of having a couple beers and earning 12 euros.  So he sat down with us and thats how I ended up being a translator between a homeless man in Germany and my two American friends at 2 AM in a park.

Vancouver has been doing this for 20 years now, give or take.   Great initiative.
I often just put them one the ground next to the cans.
There are holders in Germany but not everywhere.
In the US we have iron spikes on park benches to prevent homeless people from sleeping there. So .. you know, kinda similar.
Except the weather. We can't seem to get that one right.
That put a smile on my face :)
> Trash cans angled for easier toss from a bicycle!  Why does that not surprise me.
I remember my first week in Berlin I threw my glass bottle in the bin like a good citizen and immediately got reprimanded my friends. Felt weird to be told not to put rubbish in the bin but the system works
What? Where is this? And how do you sit on it?
Can confirm. I'm french in Bergen since 2 weeks. Fuck the rain.
well it isn't rubbish - the system is (partly) in place so you can reuse or recycle those bottles easier - so putting something with Pfand on it in the trash is actually wrong no matter where you do it

How did they approach you? I can’t imagine this being easy.
It's nice to meet awesome people.
This is heartwarming, but for fuck sake, stop taking your toddlers to restaurants. When my son was born i accepted that i wouldn't be eating out anywhere nice without a babysitter for a while. It's fucking rude. People go out to enjoy themselves, not listen to children crying.  Edit: ~~Let the down votes begin.~~
That child is not a newborn.
Oh yeah. They’re gonna be fine parents
don't bring kids to nice restaurants dude. thats not being a bro
That's nice of them, but yea, don't take your infant out to a restaurant at night when he's flat out tired.  That's just asking for disaster.
oof been there man. we were out at buffalo wild wings, ate through our starter salad, kid started freaking the fuck out (cant walk or talk yet, was clearly tired af) so as soon as the wings arrived i was like im gonna need the check and 2 boxes, and im gonna need them like 5 minutes ago, im really sorry.  wife grabbed the daughter and went outside to the car, i boxed shit up and we got the fuck out of there.  no happy ending to this one.
Why would you even take your newborn to a restaurant in the first place? Their immune system isn't fully developed until 6 months and you're basically just asking to have a shitty night while paying for the privilege.  Stay home and have a nice home cooked meal.
I love holding babies. If I could do that for the rest of my life, I gladly would. Any time I'm near a crying baby I just want to pick it up and hold it. Problem is, I'm six and a half feet tall, 230lbs, have a big scruffy beard and RBF. I'm a hugger, not a fighter, but I don't give off friendly vibes. I just want to hold all the babies.

As a restaurant manager and a father. Ive seen the case of new of parents with a young baby go through this and have sympathy of their plight. After reading this, I will offer to keep their young one hopefully docile so they can have a nice night. Thank you for posting this. It really has changed my perspective on having a young child in my restaurant. All this time I should have thought of this because I have been in their situation.

"We teach our kids about ""Tricky people"" who are anybody - someone you know or don't - that ask you to violate your safety rules.  My daughter is now 7 and will happily chat with just about anybody.  She can also point out the safest people to talk to if she gets lost (police, people working in a store, parent with kids before a single adult, etc).  She also knows that 'tricky people"" might be a coach, teacher, or family member, and that she always has the right to say no to ANYBODY.  Once we were in an airport and every member of our family was chatting with a different stranger in a line we were in.  An old lady asked my daughter ""Don't you know not to talk to strangers?""  My daughter paused for a moment and replied ""Oh, in this family, we talk to strangers!"""
GIVE ME THAT FUCKING CRYING BABY. Just a guess.
"A very stressed out woman was trying to carry her wailing baby and push a shopping cart at the same time, so I just approached her and said ""let me push this cart to your car"". I even put things away into the trunk while she fed her baby. Sometimes just being friendly and direct works wonders."
I would like to know too. As a mom of two, I would like to do this one day, if I were in the situation.
Meh. Go out. Be prepared to leave if you can't keep kid quiet. Tip well, especially if kid makes a mess.   Don't go to fancy date-night quiet restaurants at date time. But 6 pm at family style restaurants? I see no problem with this.
I agree with you. The same goes to the movies.
Maybe they already are and that’s why he did so well with the kid
This is so money. I always encourage my wife to enjoy a long shower/bath when I get home for her mental serenity and to reset the baby's nose.
But also, the smell of mom can do wonders. When my boy was an infant and he simply could not find rest, we would give him a shirt from his mom to sleep with and he calmed down.   Now, this also works from day one. When my kid was born his mom was in intensive care and before he has even met her I was told to put one of her work cloths next to him and he obviously knew the smell even though he had never smelled her before. The connection kid and mom has even from the womb is Impressive
She makes you cut your nails. It's not worth it.
I don’t think you meant to reply to the comment you did
Our daughter had a shit load of hair when she was born. But yeah this baby still looks a tad older than a newborn.
wow I love this! I feel like this is a much healthier mindset.
My sister in law was telling me about tricky people it's such a better way of looking at it. Sometimes you need to talk to strangers and shouldn't be afraid to do so, tricky people makes way more sense.
I think it was like the prisoner in the Dark Knight getting the detonator.
"Waiting in self-checkout, there was a young mom w/ a crying baby on her shoulder while she tried to scan her cart.  Her two boys, maybe 6 and 9, were horseplaying around her not helping.  She dropped a few items on the floor and was visibly upset and frustrated.  I wanted to help but was hesitant to intervene.  She started crying when she dropped another item to the floor, so I spoke up ""hey, boys.  Help your mom.  You, pick those things up from the floor and you, scan them and bag them so she can focus your baby sister. ok?""  those boys were shellshocked and immediately sprung into action.  The mom thanked me and was just visibly deflated. As I walked away a few ladies came over and were all ""oH My goD ArE yOu oKaYYyyYY?"" as if I had just screamed at them heartlessly or something.  Whatever bitches, where were you ten seconds ago?    I'm still proud at how fast those boys hopped to and started helping their mom."
I imagine you just ask if they want a hand. I think if you’re part of a couple it’s less ‘creepy’ or if you say you have kids and remember the newborn struggle. New parents hate to admit that they’re struggling but if you say about ‘I remember my daughter crying all night’ or ‘my son would only sleep if he was on me till he was 4 months’ etc it’s a good ice breaker so they don’t think you’re just going to steal or yeet the baby
Agree completely. Although from the pic, this doesn’t look like a family restaurant
He just turned three months. He’s in the 99th percentile in length. He was born with a full head of hair. He came out if the womb with a part in his hair!
Thats some keystone marriage stuff right there. Your the best kinda dude, everybody else should aspire to be similar to you.
You are a hero.
Fun fact, when a baby's just born, if you lay her on her mother's tummy she can 'crawl' to the nipple and latch on, all by herself. It's amazing to watch - there are YouTube videos of it.  Anyway, the baby isn't attracted to the scent of the milk (or colostrum, at that point) - after all, she's never smelled that before. What she's going for is a smell she recognises - amniotic fluid. Women's areola have these little bumps around the edge called Montgomery glands, and they produce a waxy substance that smells like amniotic fluid. Not only is this familiar to the baby, but she's been drinking it for months in the womb.  Also, women's nipples darken during pregnancy so they're more visible against her skin. Babies don't see very well, but they see contrast. So the dark nipples are like a target for them.  Babies do learn the smell of the milk really quickly though, as well as their mother's swear. They've done experiments on three-day-old newborns, and the babies could tell which smell was their mother's.   Source: kind of a geek about babies.
Maybe getting laid was the motivation he needed
Correct

jeezus christ...  did your wife just eat protein powder while listening to joe rogan for nine months?
I am very similar to him. After a long hard day at work, I take a nice long shower or bath while my wife takes care of the baby. It really is good for mental serenity.
No! NO! I'm at work where I can go to the bathroom whenever I want and have adult conversations and other people VERY RARELY spit up on me. I'm no hero.
You know, in the Schrute family. The youngest always raises the oldest children. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
God I'm dying this is fucking hilarious

Thats some keystone marriage stuff right there. Your the best kinda dude, everybody else should aspire to be similar to you.
I'm at home on maternity leave and have been spit up on enough to warrant clothing changes (for both me and baby) four times today. I love this child but I cannot wait to return to work and know she's safe in daycare while I wear one outfit for the whole day, communicate with other adults, feel intelligent, and pee in peace.  Parenting is hard af.
Well I can tell you you're a hero to your wife.
I am somewhat simlilar to him. After a long day of doing absolutely nothing, I still refuse to shower or bathe as I have no wife or baby. It's the BEST for mental serenity.
Thats some keystone marriage stuff right there. Your the best kinda dude, everybody else should aspire to be similar to you.
I am similar to him. After a long day of showers, i tell my wife to clean the baby's nose to reset the milk.

Jon just got a customer for life. Simple acts of kindness goes a long way~
This is the kind of content I subscribed for
"""We walk your dogs, even if you've fallen upon ruff times"""
"You know how people always say, ""Let me know if I can help.""? This is the way it's done. Don't ask. Just figure what you can do and do it.   With support like that you'll find something soon. "
You're ganna post about your doggo and not share pics of your doggo? C'mon man, I need some dat doggo.  Also, gl with the job hunt!
What does a hired dog walker cost? It’s not a common thing in my area (that I know of).
 *deep inhale * I love the smell of original content in the morning...
>*there  Made it even better
The best part about this is that it speaks volumes about how much Jon loves his job. Clearly Calli has a place in his heart and he wants to continue caring for her. You found a good one, OP! 
Name em so we can fame em.. they deserve some Venmo/Paypal love. I'd be happy to pay for them for your week of job hunting. Send me their info in a message. Make good use of the time!
Coolest part about this is how they phrase it as something they want to do rather than something they are doing for OP. I find when hard times hit having people go out of their way, even when they are doing so with the best intentions, can feel like such a burden. Phrasing it like this really helps alleviate that. (Or maybe they genuinely just like the dog that much)
I bet Calli is a good boy
If you're not at work then do you really need a dog walker?
It helps his business that his last name is Dog Walker too.  *^^Edit: ^^My ^^first ^^Gold, ^^highest ^^upvoted ^^comment, ^^all ^^for ^^my ^^stupid ^^low-effort ^^humor. ^^I ^^wouldn’t ^^have ^^it ^^any ^^other ^^way. ^^Thank ^^you. ^^This ^^is ^^my ^^peak.*
Yup. If I were in the OP's position I would never even consider another dog Walker after that and I'd be giving a nice bonus for Christmas this year (assuming the job hunt goes well).
I go to anytime fitness and I once told my gym owner that my mom was having health problems, and that I really wanted to take her to the gym and help her learn but she needed a gym with a pool because she has joint issues, so I had to cancel. They weren't able to cancel it because of how the system works but they offered to instead put the membership on hold for me for the three months so I wouldnt pay, then I would be able to cancel because the year would be up and said it was totally okay if i kept coming to the gym while it was in hold during staffed hours since my key fob wouldnt work anymore. My mom didnt end up going to work out with me so I went back to my gym and I will never forget what they did for me. My boyfriend goes to the same gym but different franchise owner and one day he got a new credit card so the payment lapsed. They told him he could stay for the day but after that couldn't come until he paid and neither of us want to go back. This kind of stuff does more for customer service than you would believe    
Yea. People who are genuinely nice all the way through.
Hikacking, because I am a dog walker and know jon. He’s an awesome dude and Cali is the cutest little brown pitt. He told me he was doing this and I will inform my clients about him when I retire. 
Arffully nice of them to arffer free services.
Exactly. People rarely go ‘oh really? You could do this this and this! Thanks!’  It’s a complicated offer. Being nice? How much do you actually want to do?  To help, just do it. Bring food by. Mow their lawn. Bring some food over and grill out. Don’t ask, just do. 
Thank you! Pics of Calli girl below!   https://imgur.com/a/Bm5Wbm4  Edit - updated link to imgur URL
Most dog walkers in Boston and Austin charge $10-15 for a half hour walk. 
"What what about the ""your""?"
Am i the only one that got the impression Calli is a she? Name seems like a females name
No. He did try to cancel their services, after all. They just loved the dog apparently, plus it retains him as a customer when he does find employment again.
A true calling. 
Growing up in Columbus Ohio, my dentist’s name was Dr Toothman  He was the son and grandson of dentists too. Loved that dude. Anyone else have him as a dentist also?
Maybe that’s why he became a dog walker...
Yea, and/or some homemade cookies, thermos of cider or hand warmers for cold winter walks
It’s the small things that mean to world to people.   The other day, I was out getting ice cream and I saw this little boy and his mom picking up trash that was outside of a trash can. It wasn’t their trash but they took the extra time to pick all of it up.   Made me smile. 
You would be barking up the wrong tree if you tried this with other dog walkers
But then I’ll actually have to do it. /s
OP has made the mistake of linking their tumblr account to reddit. Good luck
holy shit that could be a full time job
Sorry for the delay! His business info can be found here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/millers-menagerie-san-francisco  And his Venmo @k9safari
It specifically says “her” in the post.
A real “blue collar” profession. 
Michael: Sounds like a good dentist.  Dwight: Oh, yeah.  Michael: What's his name?  Dwight: ...Crentist.  Michael: Your dentist's name is Crentist.  Dwight: Yep.  Michael: Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.  Dwight: Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
As a guy who didnt grow up in Columbus Ohio i can't say I have. 
That genuinely made me smile! My dad always does this as well, I think it’s one of those little things I love most about him.
Ah whoops. I never use Tumblr. Looks like I'll be setting up a new one. 
If you can find 20 dogs a day 
"Reminds me of the time, back when I was a little shit, where I spit out my gum in a parking lot. My dad just picks up some paper, scoops it up, and just says to me, ""don't do that."" Such a small action but it stayed with me and I try and pickup after myself and others now. "
So no doggo pics today?
right, assuming you fill up an 8 hour slot which is probably very tough
I learned not to discriminate between collars    ...I am collar blind
Here ya go!   https://imgur.com/a/Bm5Wbm4
Close to a third of that may be travel time from house to house.  
Seeing these pictures and i completely understand where Jon the Dog Walker is coming from. What a beautiful dog
I used to walk dogs. The problem is owners want the dogs walked within a certain window - generally 11am-3pm. It doesn't make much sense to show up right after the owner leaves for work or right before they get home. When you add in travel time you can only handle a few dogs a day usually, unless you pack-walk (which I don't like). 
I used to have 7 dogs (all my family's) that I walked at one time. It was horrible. Would not recommend
SO. MUCH. POOP. 
*Flashbacks to piles of poop everywhere*
It looks like that kid is confused and isint used to getting gifts. I feel you buddy. Shits weird when it happens the first time
You know, this had me thinking of how their actions might change the bullied guy's perspective about life entirely. You hear about kids being bullied who commit school shootings. I'm not saying the guy would have went on a shooting spree, but their actions probably changed the dude's entire perspective of life. I'm proud of them. I just feel a little bit sad with the guy's reaction to the gifts. Is he socially shy?
Those boys parents should be commended. It’s not often you see things like this and I can’t imagine they have a lot of money at their age. It looks like a lot of heart went into this.
Weird comment to make but this is the second video I see of black teens helping a white teen. I hope racism ends with their generation. I’m sick of this shit.
A little more information here:      [https://www.fox13memphis.com/top-stories/students-at-mlk-prep-help-classmate-that-s-been-bullied-at-school/984892152](https://www.fox13memphis.com/top-stories/students-at-mlk-prep-help-classmate-that-s-been-bullied-at-school/984892152)
Watching stuff like this is how I know for sure that I won’t be able to dislike the generation behind mine the way my generation is disliked and trashed by our predecessors.   The kids are gonna be alright.
 Real solid guys. 💯🔥❤️
that backpack is badass too
My parents would spend $100 on school clothes for me each new school year.  In the lake 80s white high top Reeboks were the rage.  I always got the nock offs instead.   Seeing kids showing empathy is such a great thing.   I can think of two times growing up that I actually got a pair of Reeboks.   One kid would always make sure to step on them on purpose to mess them up....
This is why I was always a supporter of uniforms in school. Growing up with very little, it's hard to keep up with trends and what everyone else is doing while trying to just go to school.
 This is awesome.  Am I the only one who feels a little weird about it being filmed, though?
People like this always have my respect because this is not a simple act of giving a gift. They have to care enough to acknowledge the problem, compassionate enough to make the decision to help, understanding enough to take the right action, and kind enough to expect nothing in return.
He almost looked like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like okay these guys are pretending to be nice to me, when is the bad stuff going to start.   Poor kid. Also the kids that are giving him stuff are great kids.
Kid is down and in a very vulnerable state. Hard to feel happy when you're in that place, it can take a while to feel whole again. Hopefully that gift will give him back the confidence he needs.
"Just wanted to put this up top for those who want to see the rest of the story and his reaction: [https://www.fox13memphis.com/top-stories/students-at-mlk-prep-help-classmate-that-s-been-bullied-at-school/984892152](https://www.fox13memphis.com/top-stories/students-at-mlk-prep-help-classmate-that-s-been-bullied-at-school/984892152)  Edit:Sorry to those having trouble with the link. I think you can try Googling, ""fox 13 memphis mlk prep bullied teen"" and you might be able to get to the page."
I was thinking maybe it was how is he going to explain coming home with new shit. Who knows though. No way to tell who he is or his what is life is like from this. I just hope this act is an overall positive event in his life.
Probably not use to getting gifts. Or clothing very often. Anything at all very often for that matter. It’s a bit odd when it finally happens because it’s not normal for you.
I think he was scared it was a prank. Not bad on him, he was getting attention and being filmed. Prob just thought this was another bullying attempt.   I’m sure he was glowing afterwards, thinking “these guys helped me, they care, they’re my friends!”
Idk the kids wearing what looks to be a BAPE backpack which isn’t cheap. Probs has some money to him
IMO I think it’s mostly gone already it’s just a handful of scumbags that live in swamps who are assholes in general  Edit: I never meant to blame shrek sorry guys  If someone is ever raciest to you just think of shrek
">""You guys are the best guys of my entire life.""  And now I'm fucking crying"
I think it's sweet that his mom says it's because hes growing too fast. she doesnt wanna drop that financial burden onto a kid and it shows a lot of care and thought.
Yeah I think all that hateful shit aimed at younger people isn't something millennials will sign on to.
Yeah. Their parents must be proud for raising such good human beings. I feel proud of them just watching this video. Future leaders - taking real action when they see a problem in the world.
I feel you. In 7th grade (Like 1989) all the cool girls had Keds canvas shoes. I got K-Mart brand canvas shoes and drew blue squares in the back rubber soles with magic marker. I thought I was really fooling everyone. I got called out real quick as a poser-loser. No one let me forget it either.
exactly right
That’s exactly what it feels like. When you aren’t used to things going well sometimes moments that should be the happiest are overshadowed by a looming sense that it’s all about to come crashing down. Also +1 on the sentiment about how cool these kids are.
So one of the kids who brought the gifts was also one of the kids who was laughing at him in class. No wonder he was reluctant to take it.
Yes exactly. He could be very worried what will happen once he brings them home. It’s very possible he has the type of parents who would sell those out from under him or try to return them to the store for the cash. If that happens he might be wondering how he’ll explain why he’s not wearing them to school. Obviously that’s just a possible scenario but it happens all the time.   I work with a charity organization and my husband is a retired police officer who participated in “shop with a cop” at Christmas every year and brought his own card to buy the kids extra. This is frowned on but he found after years of doing it many of the kids would show up in the middle of winter without so much as socks on or more than a T-shirt. To get them boots and the like you’d have to have a card so he could buy socks and T-shirts for these poor kids separately just to get them what they needed. It’s a disgrace. One year another police officer happened to be at Walmart the week after and saw the kid’s parents returning everything my husband’s assigned kid was purchased on shop with a cop day for cash.   My husband called the mother into his office and reamed her out. If there was any way he could’ve arrested her for what she had done he would have. My friends, family and I all pitched in and got all 3 of her kids a bunch of clothing and toys and games. We cut all of the tags out of the clothing so she couldn’t return them and all of the games had all of the packaging removed.  She was warned if she tried any of her shit she would be in for a world of problems. She had been put on notice that those items were purchased for those kids and she had no right to take them away.  We even found three perfect condition Columbia ski jackets at a kids consignment shop for them. The teachers at her kid’s schools were told to make sure they saw those kids wearing all of the clothes and were properly dressed for school since they were notorious for coming in the middle of winter with next to nothing on. The lack of action regarding poor and abused kids in those schools is atrocious and makes my blood boil, but that’s a story for another day.  Two weeks later my friend saw the mother at Walmart wearing one of the kids Columbia jackets on a school day. The kid was at school without his jacket but since he had on a thin long sleeved T-shirt they said it wasn’t neglect. Technically she didn’t return them and there was nothing they could do about it. Some people are shameless.
Not used to getting attention.
I also imagine he was waiting for it to turn bad. Lots of people have shitty formative years and see every interaction with a stranger as a potential for humiliation or bullying.
That’s a fake bape bag, or just a bag inspired by bape. A real bape backpack looks nothing like that
"Its mostly gone in the younger generations, at least over racism, but as another commenter said more subtle ""learned"" racism that people dont think about is still pretty prevalent."
I have worked with middle and high school kids the last ten years. The new generation is so much kinder and accepting than when I was in school. Kids are still kids but I think people are getting better.
In all fairness I’ve heard that same excuse from a woman who spent all her money on meth instead of food and clean clothes for her kid. No ones saying she should buy him top of the line designer wear but even my Dad as a single parent was able to clothe me with thrift wear or things donated.  It really feels like there’s more going on here and it’s not as wholesome as we wish it could be.
The teenagers subreddit is pretty fucking wholesome. It's like they're on a sinking ship, all holding onto one life vest, hoping for the best, and making jokes along the way.  At 30, I'm noticing it's not helpful to not support the kids younger than me. They're hopeful idiots like I was, but this new generation seems like they're gunna be alright, and it really makes me happy.
Could also be a bit of embarrassment. I’m not used to getting gifts and I was a bit like this once during a work birthday event. Sometimes you gotta fake the excitement even though you are excited but a little shy and whatnot.
Yeah. The one who received the gift did seem happy in the article, though, so it is good that everything went well in the end.  It's commendable that the kid recognized his wrongs, admitted to it, and tried to make amends.  I know a ton of people who can't even make the first step of recognizing their wrongs.  Especially when it involves going against the grain of what everyone else was doing in that environment. Mob/sheep mentality one of the worst aspect of humans, I tell you.  But it takes just a few people to break that mentality and to create a domino effect of others recognizing that they can be better, too, or at least we'd hope that other people have learned from their examples at least in that school.
Positive* attention  Being bullied gets you plenty -- it's just negative.  The sad thing is, he was probably standing there just waiting for it to be revealed as some cruel prank. When all you're used to is getting shit on, you wait for the turds.
R/repfashion is leaking
These dudes did a really nice thing and I think their intentions were definitely genuine. Good on them for that. If everyone looked out for each other like these dudes did, the world would be such a better place.  It probably should have been done in private though. The kid looks like he’s embarrassed because there’s people all around and filming which kind of just brings more attention to the fact that he doesn’t have any other clothes /:
My birthday was today and I didn’t tell anyone at work because I hate getting that kind of attention but one of my coworkers saw on Facebook it was my birthday and they sang to me. It was nice but honestly I hated it haha
It’s a double edged sword. Dude might be a bit embarrassed but i can’t help but feel like these gestures are contagious and that’s a good thing too
Yeah, I'm... pretty conflicted about the way this was done and the fact that it was shared like this. It's an incredibly sweet gesture, but it really seems like he was unsure of their intentions, probably uncomfortable with having it done so publicly, and quite possibly embarrassed even further with it being filmed and shared online.  I think it's important to show others that kindness has value and to lead by example, but putting someone in the spotlight like this also runs the risk of reducing them into an object lesson. It focuses on the giver, on the gesture, on the symbolic value...but inadvertently ignores how the recipient might feel about being the subject of public charity. *Especially* in a high school setting, that could very likely lead to *more* bullying.  If someone had done this to me in public while I was in high school (and then shared it to social media) I would've been really embarrassed and I would've felt like I was just being used as some kind of prop.  And I remember when I was in middle school, a group of girls made a plan to ironically compliment my appearance together just so that they could laugh about it as they walked away. I can't help but think that maybe this kid is just wondering when those boys are going to start laughing.  I know I sound cynical as hell, and I'm not trying to downplay the act of kindness because *kindness matters,* especially in that kind of setting. And I'm not saying that these boys did anything wrong, because they probably had the best intentions. I just think it's important to consider the context and the recipient's perspective whenever you consider doing something like this. And maybe do it in a more private way. Because, while it's certainly important to show the world that compassion matters, it's also important to show people who are hurting that *their* feelings matter, too.   There are other ways to demonstrate kindness to the world (while also doing acts of kindness like this one more privately).
I feel bad that the kid is just on reddit now.  He has no control over that.  What if he doesn't want to be here?  I wouldn't if I were in his position.
He looks like he's laughing, so it's likely he's still an arrogant pos.
This is great and I love seeing this but the blood supply, is dangerously low everywhere in the US. The red cross estimates they have a 3 day supply for most blood types. And less for type O.   Dont wait for something terrible like this to happen go out and give it's a simple way to make meaningful change.  Edit: Dang thanks for the platinum and silver just wanted people to go donate
“When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ‘look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping .’” -Mister Rogers
Hey I was there! Stood in the 100 degree sun for 2 hours. There were angels that came by an just handed out food, water, hats and umbrellas. No one was organized.  Just random people that picked up some stuff to come hand it out to those waiting.  Edit: While I appreciate the silver,  consider giving to the el Paso victims relief fund instead of reddit awards.  https://pdnfoundation.org/give-to-a-fund/health-leadership-fund?BBFund=24&BBHideOtherFunds=1
Wow it's sad that it's necessary but these are real bros
This is where the focus needs to be in situations like this. Focus on those affected, and those willing to help. The less attention shooters get, the better!
Look at all of those Americans. People from different backgrounds and races coming together to provide blood. Something that every human possesses and is equally beneficial regardless of what you look like on the outside or believe on the inside. What a statement.
Fred Rogers was asked to say something to help children after 9-11. He said that when he was small, his mother told him that in times of tragedy to look to the helpers. Thank you El Pasoans. Thank you Mister Rogers.
Thanks for the gold!!!But there are other places to spend your money.
When it comes down to it, people are good.  Edit: Don't downvote the skeptical guy, he had a real question because he didn't know.
I fucking love my city. Every time something horrible happens the community comes together to help. It's amazing.
And remember that blood expires.  Sometimes it’s good to donate a week or two after the tragedy to replenish supplies afterwards.
Last week I lost 1/3 of my blood in a very complicated birth. I have O+ and needed several bags of blood. I know there isn’t a lot of my type around.  I’ve cried because of the generosity of a stranger I never met. They helped save my life.  When I’m better, I’m going to give back. What kind and good people giving so generously. I understand it on a deeper level than I ever could have before, and I appreciate every single one of these people deep inside my heart.
God damn, how is that man still comforting me decades later.
What a gift he was to humankind.
El Pasoans are good people. Thank you for being one of those good people.
Yeah as someone who lives in El paso this is really heart breaking but seeing things like this photo remind me why I love this city.
In lieu of reddit awards, consider giving to the el Paso victim relief fund  https://pdnfoundation.org/give-to-a-fund/yellen-family-fund?BBFund=35&BBHideOtherFunds=1
It takes weeks to expire. But I agree, go whenever you can.
I'm glad you're doing better!!  I have 0+ too. I'm donating power red this coming week.
Actually o pos is the most common, that's why they need more of it. And hope you get better soon!
FTFY: God damn, how is that man still comforting us decades later.
"I don't think he'd appreciate your use of ""God damn"", but he would accept it and speak with you about how it is important that we are aware of our feelings and that we express them, but also that we should try to avoid causing distress to others in the way that we do so."
So glad you’re safe, OP. I went to school in El Paso and met the love of my life there.
IIRC it lasts 43 days if stored in optimum conditions.
PITTSBURGH baby. He’s still such a huge cultural hero here. A few weeks ago I saw him on a huge mural on the side of the building.
Thank you. Happy that you found someone you love in our wonderful city.
42, only remember it because we had ads about it here recently, and it was joked that Hitch-hikers guide to the galaxy was onto something.
I think 42 is also a thing related to reincarnation  Ninja: looked it up real quick and that's 49. NM
I have two deaf cousins. They didn't believe in Santa because the mall Santas could never talk with them. Years ago a mall advertised that they had a Santa who could sign. The line went through the mall and out the door. Families drove hours so their deaf child could talk to Santa. My one cousin went himself even though he was in college. He just wanted a chance to talk to a Santa. Somewhere my mom has a photo of him sitting on Santa's knee when he was 21-22 years old. Has the biggest smile on his face. 
Would anyone be willing to provide a transcript? I wish I knew how to sign. ._.
Aaaaaawwww real Santa!
My dad was Santa at all of my childhood school holiday events. My sister and I were always his elves. I remember feeling so special that my dad was chosen  to be “Santa’s helper” every year and had Santa’s phone number saved in our address book and speed dial. With that said, all my family ever had to do was threaten to hit the speed dial button if I was doing anything naughty! The temptation to call him myself was so real, I just never knew what I’d say if he picked up. My father died about 12 years ago when I was 19. People still come up to me to say they remember him fondly as Santa. I forgot about this nice memory until just now. Thanks for the reminder! 
I bet for a lot of folks who do this type of work, it may be stressful, overwhelming, and difficult at times, but these types of encounters are what make it all worthwhile.

I'm crying 😭😭😭😭
[Here](https://youtu.be/ac9-lv37J3A) they are a few days later, with a reunion!
Reminds me of the scene from Miracle on 34th Street. 
I work in a restaurant at the Mall of America and the resident Santa comes in on his break a lot. Of course, kids are constantly interrupting his meal to say hi and he is the nicest person and give every single child his full attention and time often letting his food get cold in the process. We've offered to remake food for him so it's hot but he refuses happily. He is a grade A santa.
I worked at a Subway in my local mall for years in high school and we had an incredibly cool guy that played Santa throughout the holidays. Owner of the Subway loved the guy and we gave him free subs whenever he wanted. Absolutely never broke character for any reason and he'd have kids walking up to him in the food court during what were technically his breaks, never batted an eye just talked to them and always had some time to spare for any 5 year old thinking they were meeting the real Santa. He could easily have eaten/taken breaks in a non public spot but I honestly think he just enjoyed making their days. 
I knew a guy who used to do it.  I don’t think in the  mall, but at various events, and I think he would go to the children’s hospitals as well.  Thing is - dude could’ve walked in without his costume, and you still would’ve thought he was Santa.    He had a big belly, and big long white beard, and a huge laugh that would put tears in his eyes and just radiate goodness.  He was also suffering with serious diabetes and whole host of other problems and was pretty much on death’s door every time I saw him.  But he still volunteered where I worked (not Santa, something else) at least 10 hours a week and made time for whatever Santa stuff he did, and a full time job, and who knows what else.    I think it was a combination of trying to right some past wrongs with himself as well as give as much as he could while he was here.  He was serious - not heavy and significant - but truly given to what he was doing.  An inspiring man.
There you go making me cry on a Saturday morning.
Based on my very recent studies, I can conclude that tears don't actually improve the taste of my cereal.

Suchhh cute!!
Did you ever call the number?  Maybe it's the real 🎅!
*hold it together dammit* oh... That's a cute video
i prefer to watch the gif because thats how the little girl experienced it
What the fuck?  Somebody showed me /r/happycryingdads earlier.  I must look like I got stood up at prom or something right now.  Is there a word for doing this to one's self?  Happy-sadism?
Best scene in the whole movie.  Kid is in a terrible situation, Santa is probably the only person who has spoken Dutch to her since she arrived.  All the adults see disaster coming since they believe he can't speak Dutch, but she believes he can, because he looks like Sinterklaas.  Then he does!  Everyone is astonshed except Santa and the girl.  Susan is now really confused because her mom has never been wrong before, but wow, this looks real.
r/goodsanta
Should make him something anyway, maybe just an app/desert or something? What’s his typical meal? See if you can comp him some time. Bet it would make his day and he deserves it.  Edit: a letter
>#I'm on my fuckin' lunch break!  -Bad Santa
Sorry. 
Smart girl. I wouldn’t lie to Santa either. 
Do her other brothers deny it though?
You just made me laugh out loud at work. You're good people. 
"There are a fair number of signs in common with ASL, and this is pretty close to what I picked up, except I read the end as, ""If you're nice, Santa will bring it(the doll) to you."""
This uh... ruins the gif
Seems like he's asking about favorite reindeer, being Dancer or Cupid
Good question. I did NOT call. I was and still am highly risk averse. I was told that if I called Santa, I’d get no presents.  Good thing I didn’t, I really quite loved my creepy crawlers, gator golf, and McDonald’s Barbie set :) 
There’s uh... there’s a reunion video  https://youtu.be/ac9-lv37J3A
Sometimes when I'm really happy in life I'll pop over to YouTube and binge watch videos of soldiers coming home, color blind people seeing with those glasses, pregnancy announcements, anything that gets my water works flowing. I love having that happy-cry combo!
This needs to be a thing...
Oh
Way to go, now you’ve given Father Christmas diabetes.  
Crafty comment and relatable username.
When that reindeer walks in with that itty bitty waist and those antlers in my face....
go ahead and believe the big butt one i guess
Sounds like a conversation santa would have with a verbal two year old.  Two year olds don't make for great conversation.
It is now and it's terrifying 
OhOhOh
the man has a belly like a bowl full of jelly and consumes billions of cookies a year, are you suggesting he doesn't *already* have diabetes?
"lmao When I married my wife I inherited a Christmas decoration passed down through her family dubbed ""Big Booty Reindeer"". Thanks for the chuckle."
I'm nice. OldBigsby is nice.
/r/nocontext
Yeah the mom literally says she can do animals and stuff. But look how interactive she became when she saw he could sign. She went from zoned out to enthralled. Fantastic really.
"Started playing the first video...saw the title ""Boy dies in Santa's arms"" and noped the fuck out of there. It's too early for those feels man. Someone tougher than me watch and report back?"
ITS TIME TO ACCELERATE!!!
Well, unless a sweet elderly man looking like Santa talking about the day he fullfilled the last wish of a terminally ill child all while crying gets to you, you're good. And if you're good, you're fucked up.
I watched the video because I just had to know what it was actually about.. I figured it wouldn't be morbid if it's on Youtube.   But yeah.. jesus... If that video doesn't break your heart, you have no heart.  [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1mHWeOp_H8) for the curious.
I really don't. :D
At 86, he watched a video of his retirement when he was in his 60's and commented about how young he was. I certainly need to take heed to these words. I'm in my 30's and worry about aging, but it's so silly to worry about such things.  
Idk maybe it’s because my grandfather passed rather recently but this really hit me. That’s an adorable letter. Shit, OP, frame that. 
This is just classy, graceful and adorable at the same time. We have certainly lost a step somewhere in terms of grace while adjusting to the digital world.. 
This is by far the cutest old man. I appreciate how he went into just enough detail to make me feel his happiness. 
I occasionally write thank you letters (hand written) but never this good. I need to step up my game.   : )
Make sure there transferred to digital video files as well!!!  Tell him that if he can get it done.
Ouh ninjas cutting onions again 
The alternative to aging isn’t good,enjoy the trip👍
I'm 42 and have terminal cancer.    Don't worry about growing older. Embrace it. 
I'm in my 20s and I feel like im decaying 
I agree with this 100%
That's it!  I lost my grandfather in June last year. I'm ok with death, and I understand loss is a part of life. But hearing about these memories really makes me reflect on mine, and it's the memories that wrench the soul.   Hang in there, though. The best thing you can do in honour of him is to live, and cherish what you had and what you have.   Much love   P.S. Yes, OP. Frame this. Please
"""Jeez, we were young.""  At 33 I already feel that when watching old home movies, not sure how that's going to feel if I get to live to 86.   Time is relentless. "
86 years old.. that's what happens when you have free time. I'm not saying this in the bad way, less work = more time to enjoy and appreciate 
All of us in 40-60 years buying DVD players, take note. Make a robots day
*61 years old.* Jeez, were we young.   :’)
So funny you assumed male and I assumed female!
But do you write them to eBay sellers after buying something? Certainly takes feedback to the next level.
That's damn good advice, wow. 
"Is the alternative to aging ""younging?"""
If you don't already, now's the best time to start taking care if yourself. Find a social hobby, exercise, try and eat cleanly.  I'm in my 30s and am daily grateful I started that effort in my 20s. 
You'll feel like Matthew Mcconaughey during *that* scene in Interstellar.
Sadly almost nobody makes dvds like the generation made VHS tapes.
really? I assumed male too, can't explain why but I immediately imagined an old man. 
Ebay used to be like this a lot, at least with the folks I sold to. I sold old sheet music, and people would get so excited to find a song that meant something to them.
As my great grandfather said “gettin old’s a bitch but the alternative is worse”
Dying
This is very true. I took up heroin in my 20s and it wasn't the best idea.  Sincerely, 35 year old with 22 months clean. 
"Among other clues, I can't imagine most old ladies using the expression ""not up to my game.""  Either way, it's an adorable letter - good way to start the long weekend."
The phrasing says old man to me. I also somehow think that a woman would be more likely to have kept the VCR to go with the tapes.
I can! The buyer was male
My grandfather always says: everyone wants to grow old but nobody wants to be old
"I have an ancient paternal great-grandma who lives in Cork, Ireland.  She is so old that she remembers Lindbergh flying from New York to Paris,  and is now seeing her children die of old age. It seems most people who reach that sort of advanced age approach life with a wistful fatigue.    Not her - gallows humor and cackling.  Her son,  a lifelong heavy drinker,  died last year at 81, and she said ""Oooh,  won't someone thinkah the poor worms, they'll be drunk 50 years! "" I also heard her declare ""Everyone I remember from my young days're dead.  Do ya know what it means?  It means I won! ""   She also told me ""I don't fret about god, ya know.  I'm so old I taught god's daddy ta play the trombone!"" I have no idea what the hell that means,  but I accept it."
My grandfather is dead. I miss him. I’d give anything to have him back. He’d have protected me. Think of that. Live healthy. Live well. Stay alive for your grandkids. They’ll thank you for it. 
To each their own 
My last parent passed away last year.  No more grandparents or parents for me.  You can feel the last firewall between yourself and oblivion crumble away upon their loss- no more elders to look to for guidance, ever again.  I am genuinely thankful for the time we had together, and I have no regrets in my relationship with them. We all loved one another.   The emptiness still rings loud.
Fuck eating disorders so hard. You're kicking ass.
The real Steve Rogers. His super power was never his body, but his heart, and you got a ton of it. Keep going.
Im so proud of you.  I have anorexia and bulimia too and I know the struggle. You are a superhero to me too tbh.  It amazes me your determination. My mindset didnt switch yet. Im still going downhill lmao. Anyways. Knowing your story kinda gave me nostalgic hope right now, so thank you for sharing.   Wish you the best. Keep fighting. I know recovery is a long journey. But you did the hard part☺️u rock 
You went from   ^andrew  to  #ANDREW
Way to go!!! I’m so proud of you!   Thanks for sharing your story as a man in recovery from anorexia. I lost one of my best (male) friends to anorexia-related suicide a few years ago and I don’t think the topic gets enough attention. Recovery is HARD. But you’re doing great!! And I’m so incredibly happy for you.   Please remember that you are perfect the way you are, and that you are worthy of love and happiness no matter what you look like. Never stop believing in yourself. I wish you all the happiness in the world. <3 
a beautiful boy, inside and out. showed this to my mum and she says that she wishes you all of the happiness on earth. we love you, andrew. 💕☺️
Could kick my ass for sure!
Fuck I read this as “Fucking eating dinosaurs so hard.” 
Heck yeah! Real life Steve Rogers here. Learning to love himself amd take care of himself. With gentleness, kindness, and heart. 
Hell yeah you're awesome man keep going 
I heard people with anorexia lose their periods but damn that was hard to read.  (sorry)  Seriously though great job man I can't imagine how much discipline and healing it took to get to where you are today. Made me smile indeed. 
Im rooting for you! You will eventually get there!
If you can express this much love for someone else, you have it in you to love yourself again. Don’t give up and keep fighting the good fight! I’m rooting for you.   Edit: Wow my first silver! Thanks so much for all the love. I too struggle with a lot of things including disordered eating, and honestly showing love for other people always makes me feel better!
Could eat my ass 
Steve Rogers just took magic roids, OP put in work!  His body was earned and he got himself out of the dark hole that is an eating disorder, I’d say OP is better than Rogers, besides I prefer Iron Man.
Aw thank you so much. You are so sweet. I wish you the best to you too. Im getting emotional lmao
r/suddenlygay
Hey u dont gotta be gay to enjoy your ass eaten.
You don't have to be gay, and you don't have to be a dude...
Precious memories from the best times of our lives.
When your kid is an infant, you keep thinking “Please learn to walk, so I don’t have to carry you around all the time.” But the moment they start taking steps, it’s like “Wait, no, come back, stay here, don’t go in *there* or out *there*!”
So sweet and genuine! Your child is very lucky to have you both as parents. Only good things are going to come from a child growing up with that kind of love and support. I love the moment when your husband goes to grab the little one to stop a fall but then pulls his hands back like, “no, I gotta let them do this on their own.”   Side note: your husband is also a total babe.
How amazing that you got that on video!
Please make sure to make backups of this! Not only reddit as backup, but real backups.
r/happycryingdads
I bet you there’s not a lot of husbands out there that have actually seen their babies’ first steps because of work.  To have recorded the baby and the husband - it’s awesome!!
Thanks for sharing this special moment with us, dad's look of shock and joy is touching and you and the little guy are so sweet with his praise. Best wishes
Absolutely, I need to run around with a camera on my head I’m so worried I’ll miss something!
Absolutely, every new thing he learns is exciting but at the same time he’s less and less my little baby and more and more independent
Thank you for your kind words, I feel like the lucky one to have both of them! I couldn’t agree more 😉
He’s been showing signs but this video was VERY long, this is just the highlight 😅
I’ve got a hard drive with all his photos but this is excellent advice still!
I like to think bubs waits till dads around to do his tricks just for dads reaction, I love it.
You miss more when you try to catch more. Gotta enjoy the moment sometimes and not reach for the camera and miss both the moment and the shot.  Unless you have a camera on your head, then you'll have everything and watch nothing.   Am photographer.
I’m at the other end of that process — my youngest kid just graduated from high school and is leaving for college in a couple months. Today is probably the last Father’s Day that I’ll have a kid living at home. It’s great to see them grow up and reach near-independence, but I kinda miss the days when they needed me more. Enjoy your wonderful journey!
I just feel bad your kid is going to grow up a Pats fan... I’m teasing (mostly)! What a lovely video and they are so lucky to have parents as loving and proud as you all are!
Worth every second of all that extra footage!
From the kid's point of view, I kinda miss those days too.
It’s crazy to look at this tiny human and think one day they are going to graduate and live a whole life. At the same time looking at them graduating must be like, I taught you to walk and now look.
>I just feel bad your kid is going to grow up a Pats fan... I’m teasing (mostly)! What a lovely video and they are so lucky to have parents as loving and proud as you all are!  My first thought, too.
"Can confirm. I never had to deal with ""storage is full"" warnings before we have our baby. He's a toddler now but I still can't get myself to delete the old videos off my phone.  I really need to transfer all these to my computer soon.  Edit:  Holy cow! I read your replies and would like to say thank you so much for sharing tips/stories about backing up. I know it’s all common sense but I never really felt the urgency to backup my phone so I’m doing it now via Google photos. Will also backup on my pc tomorrow.  I cant imagine how much I’ll hate myself if I lose all these photos/videos because I didn’t do what can easily be done to save these. Thanks everyone! https://i.imgur.com/BaNrTMN.jpg"
Yeah,  but those always malfunction just when it's about to record something important
From my dog's point of view, everything is black and white
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
Here’s an article about this young man, in Portuguese: https://www.psicologiasdobrasil.com.br/aprovado-em-medicina-na-usp-fazia-faxina-para-pagar-cursinho/  As a little bit of background: Brazil’s public universities are free, but you have to pass an entrance exam called the Vestibular that is very difficult. What was meant to be a measure to make the country more of a meritocracy hasn’t exactly worked in practice. Instead what happened is a bunch of private companies sprung up to tutor people to pass the exam. So young people often need to pay for the prep courses and also study full time for about a year in order to pass the exam. Naturally, it is mostly affluent Brazilian youths with family support who can afford to do this. So it ends up being less meritocratic- rich kids get the prep and training they need, and then get the university for free. When stories like this kid come out, it really captivates the public’s imagination, because he’s “made it”, the way the system was intended to work, against all odds. As a bonus, he came in 4th in his desired field, medicine, and will be studying at (arguably) Brazil’s most prestigious university. I’m an American, but I lived two years in Brazil and love the country and follow the news there.   If you're curious to learn more about Brazil, I have a video where I discuss impressions about the country before and after living there for two years, here (in Portuguese, with English subtitles): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVUkkPA3qD4&t=8s 
This picture is so emotional. I'm very happy for all of them.  Do you happen to know what university was it?
The girl's reaction is so pure, shows that she is truly happy for him
Congrats to both him and his mother 👏
Oh look at the love in his sisters eyes. How awesome. A bright future awaits him, no doubt. Many, many congratulations Gabriel!
The 3% IRL
Medicine is literally the hardest course to pass here on Brazil in every state and  USP is the most famous university here, pretty big deal, congratulations to he and his family.
In Brazil it's common for rich people go to public universities while poor people have to work loads to go to private schools, so this kind of news make me very happy. I'm sure that a bright future awaits for this kid.
My girlfriend who is Brazilian agrees with your assessment of the university exam system. 
He ended up at the Univesity of Sao paulo, USP.
That’s 10 seconds before he burst into tears and his mom became a fountain. Pure happiness is the weirdest thing, it makes you so giddy and smiley and yet causes you to well up with tears. Humans are so weird.
This is what I came to say! She is SO proud of him!
Its really her accomplishment too, isn’t it? It’s just such a beautiful picture 
Opposite of the United States
My wife went to USP!
The sister is what turned this into /r/mademecry for me.
That said, our public universities are typically pretty great. Top tier private schools will beat them out, but most state schools will give a fantastic education to those who need it 
In Brazil you have to apply for a specific course, he applied to med school, acceptance rate for that is less than 1%
I went to Mizzou (University of Missouri)...you can't really find or pay for a better journalism education anywhere else in the country. The best public school in my home state (University of Illinois) has engineering, veterinary and accountancy programs that set you up for a career as good as any of the best private schools. 32ACT and a 3.8gpa and I wouldn't have been accepted to public schools like Michigan or UNC if I tried.  As far as law, healthcare and STEM...there arent any public schools that you'd be embarrassed to have a degree from (except maybe Kansas) and they're affordable for anyone in the state. I think the Land Grant University system is really something to be proud of.
Yes
Also off duty
She’s playing life on hard mode and winning.
Good on her! Regaining use of your legs after paralysis is hard enough already, but doing it as a 6 year absolutely fucking astounding!
Just when I was starting to think I had a shitty day :’)
From cancer to dancer.
Getting cancer early as a child is the Dark Souls of real life  Ps: I'm glad to hear she's regained movement :)
Minecraft hardcore
Thank you for your kind words, FurryPornAccount
I'm a cancer survivor. Got it at 25. The cancer hospital I was at started my treatment immediately, and literally the only available bed was in the Pediatric Ward. So many little kids with cancer. I never got over the morbid feeling that I was lucky to make it as far as I did before it caught me.

At age 12, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Almost 2 years of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Now I am 30, I have two children and I am a children's doctor. In Russia. I apologize in advance for bad english. I am writing through Google translator :)
Fellow Hodgkin’s lymphoma survivor here, that’s awesome to hear your life story and the translations surprisingly good!
This is not my English. This is English Google :-D
"She did a ted talk in 2017 ""How to take a picture of a black hole"" - https://youtu.be/BIvezCVcsYs  And today it happened. Huge Congratulations to her and her team. It is a wonderful achievement."
Seeing a look of pure joy on someone’s face will never get old. Massive kudos to her for this amazing feat.
Before people slam this as some sort of diversity promo, check her out.  She's astounding.  https://people.csail.mit.edu/klbouman/
Something really cool to witness during our lifetimes
This is fucking awesome, I don't even know her and I'm so proud of her.  It's astounding the difference in human intelligence, she's out here taking pictures of black holes and I have to hang off my bed for 3 minutes while saying fuck just to plug in my phone... and I can't even comprehend how it works.
That pic is almost better than the black hole pic. Good for her perseverance, and fuck the woman haters.
Look at that fucking wizardry on the board. And here I am struggling in an undergrad program that isn’t even in the STEM field like the neanderthal I am.  Kudos to you and your team smart space woman. We need more people like you.
Youngest Nobel Prize recipient?
Happiness^10
I wonder what it's like to be this smart lol
Nobel prize headed her way.
Astonishing work!
I also love how on-brand their room is for academia.  Chalk board with hastily scribled formulas?  Check  People sitting around a small table in a windowless room without air conditioning?  Check  Matching laptops?  Check
You can tell shes absolutely ecstatic and its wonderful
Misogynists slam any woman who does anything noteworthy. Nothing you say will stop them from shitting themselves over this, unfortunately.
Well if she's in charge of a project this important at her age, you can be certain that she's a damn genius without knowing anything else about her.
It’s really amazing how far we have come
I’m not saying there aren’t real, tangible differences in intelligence between people, but I’d bet that a huge part of this achievement is self-discipline and commitment. You don’t become a doctor studying black holes just because you’re smart enough.  I guess what I’m trying to say is that you probably haven’t reached the full potential of your intelligence, and if you really wanted to dedicate the time to it, you could understand phones and/or black holes.
No.  Edit. She's 29  Edit. Downvote all you want. This is The fact.
Astronomer here!  She won't get it.  You can only give the prize to three people in a collaboration, per the rules stipulated by Alfred Nobel when he set up the physics one.  What this happens in practice with a collaboration of 200 people like the Event Horizon Telescope is they've already had a lot of infighting to figure out who will get it, and [Shep Doeleman](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/shep-doeleman) (who first really got EHT going), for example, is probably on that list.  If that sounds like a stupid system, it is.  Thousands of people got things like the Higgs discovered and LIGO to work who didn't get a Nobel Prize either.
With science becoming increasingly computerized over time, it would be interesting if we started seeing more and more Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, and medicine awarded for work primarily involving programming/algorithms/machine learning/artificial intelligence/neural networks/etc.
"The ""Outstanding Move"" of today is for Katie! Congrats!"
"In a way it helps 'confirm' Einstein's theory of relativity. [Here's an article that touches on why it's significant from that perspective.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/science/1112479/Black-hole-picture-albert-einstein-general-relativity-black-hole-photo-m87-event-horizon/amp)  Generally the scientific community does tend to avoid saying that any theory is ""proved"" but it does solidify something that was accepted from one of his theories."
It's a sterotype because it's true, even at a trade school.
Radio astronomer here- we are actually even worse in terms of women in our sub-field than all of astronomy, at about 20%.  It is both astounding and depressing at the same time to be the only woman in the room at a workshop or similar and have someone speculate about why they let you in as the token women, instead of wondering why there's only one there.  Edit: The trolls are out, and upset that I suggest women face bias in radio astronomy!  So if you don't just trust me, a woman in radio astronomy, telling you I have faced bias... first off, you can't make the assumption that women aren't interested in the field when [studies show half of women are harassed in science](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/06/12/half-of-women-in-science-experience-harassment-a-sweeping-new-report-finds/?utm_term=.05e9a6df24cb), for example, and studies document many other implicit biases in science.  Want a recent, well-documented example?  Women consistently do not get as much telescope time on observatories like Hubble, where people propose for ten times more time than there is to allocate.  So the last time around they did a double blind proposal system, where you wouldn't know who's applying and who is reading the proposals.  [Guess which proposal cycle had more women get time than men for the first time ever?](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190301a/full/)
My niece is like this girl, but earlier on in her career. She's so smart I can't even keep up with her in the areas I know the most about.  I saw OP's pic, looked her up, thought I'd share.
"They have no issue with such sentiment if the leader of the team is a man. But when the leader of the team is a woman, suddenly it's a ""she was just one of many people responsible for the picture.""  Thankfully *this* thread is pleasant, but an /r/videos thread earlier was a shitshow of misogyny."
not just her age but a graduate student. i'm blown away.  edit: seems like she's a post doc, still pretty f*cking amazeballs
We really do live in a society
"Also worth noting that this amount of commitment is definitely not for everyone and if you don't feel like it's for you there's absolutely no reason to feel bad about it!   Huge achievements like this are obviously great, but unfortunately some people will go ""man, I'll never do something like this..."" which I always find unfortunate, because you really shouldn't tie your self-worth to having to accomplish some huge feat that like 0.0001% of people might accomplish the equivalent of.  You really have to listen to yourself to figure out, what you truly want. I for one am at peace with the fact that I most likely won't accomplish anything people will speak of for a long time after I die, I just want to do what makes me happy and if that accidentally happens to result in some kind of legacy that'll just be a strange side effect, nothing more.  Basically what I'm saying is, don't think you have to leave a legacy. Most long-lasting legacies were a result of passion and commitment, not a result of a person wanting to leave a legacy."
I assume you're not a woman, and thus not used to it happening constantly.  But I'm betting anything, that if I scroll down to the bottom of the page, there will be a slew of misogyny that, happily, got downvoted.  Maybe they posted this comment before that clean up happened.
">no one was even talking about that  [Here's a whole thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/bbmnp2/katie_bouman_the_person_behind_the_the_picture_of/) of people blaming her for hogging the spotlight and stealing credit from the team because she's a ""cute girl"" with heavy implications that she was only picked to lead the team because she was pretty.  You can start there..."
"Seriously...why the downvotes here folks? He's correct. She's too old. She better win the damn thing, but she won't be the youngest  Edit: oh yay! Reddit did it's ""it all works out in the end"" thing."
or it needs a new category for computer science.
[Katie Bouman the moment when the first black hole image was processed.](https://i.imgur.com/fPZQKEC.jpg)
She's not a graduate student. She's an assistant professor as of this year and was a postdoctoral fellow before, meaning she completed her PhD. Although none of this detracts from how impressive her accomplishments are :D
Well, first, the scientific Nobels are always awarded to people, not organizations. But if IBM or HP researchers (not that I think HP employs a lot of them) conducted Nobel worthy research, why not?
Looks like you have more friends than you thought!
Happy birthday 😊
Bar staff only give their favorite customers presents. I'll bet they look forward to seeing you walk in the door. Happy birthday! You're clearly a good seed!
Sometimes you wanna go WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME!
You go to an awesome bar! Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!! You’ve come another year further and another year wiser (as cheesy as it sounds).   I hope your new age comes with nothing but health and happiness for you. 
Happy birthday. You don’t always realize who is thinking of you.
Happy birthday!!!!

Thanks :)
Thank you for the birthday wishes! It's hard sometimes to not think that they only talk to me because I'm a customer, it was such a great feeling to be shown otherwise like this
Bartender here, can confirm. They obviously like you OP.
:) thank you
Thanks :)
This comment deserves gold
Funny how reddit works sometimes
It never makes any sense.
Life's greatest mystery. 
Lol the gold train has ended
choo choo muthafucka
New to Reddit . What is gold for ?
Nope, it's every other comment! 
am i too late?
I wouldn’t know, I’ve never gotten it  Edit: Never mind, thank you kind stranger!
Nice shot!
Stfu
Probably this one. 
What is that gold medal?
cum in me gold daddy
Representing all the people who don’t sort by new and therefore always get here 1 hour too late.   Edit: Obligatory “Thank you kind stranger” My first gold is complaining about never getting gold.  
There's no rhyme or reason, damn it! Sheer mayhem! 
It is now over, and that’s a fact that we all have to accept.  Edit: shiny!
It's tricky sometimes being me, I always seem to find these things minutes after they end
Underguilded comment
pannin' here
My turn
Not this one.
What’s happening 
Is it still going?
You thought wrong. 
Looks like I’m a little late to the party...  Edit: looks like there were some leftovers... 😁
A day late, a gold short.   *edit- my first gold. My day has finally come and I don't even know what to do with it. Thank you, kind Reddit stranger! 
He loves his big brother 💙
The P.S. is so cute
Tell him happy birthday from all of us here in this thread!  EDIT: Thanks for the Platinum, kind stranger! Made my week!
you better tuck him in right now
Hope you didn’t miss his birthday!
This is so precious❤️ Thanks for sharing! Happy birthday!
I have seen a lot of things similar to something such as this and what I realize and admire...  People with Downs/Autism have a way of cutting through the day to day grind of bullshit and focus on the “human” factor of being alive.  To be honest, I am not an ass, but that note would have mentally taken me down a notch or two, and rightfully so.
"Autism doesn't stop a good sense of humor.  I'll be ending every note with ""P.S. Please read this note"" from now on.  Love it.  Your bro's the man!"
P.S. PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT.
Incredible kid there....happy birthday
I work in a Mod-Severe autism classroom but Elementary grade but this makes me BYOND happy! The way he communicated was beyond excellent! Especially since it's usually VERY hard for them to tell us what they do/don't want! And to see his big brother support him is even more AMAZING!!!!
This is so beautifully wholesome.    I hope you have him a big hug!
How excited was he when you walked in to tuck him in? #RightInTheFeels
"Yes he does! I love him, too.  Edit: Gonna hijack my own comment real quick to say I'm going to bed now. Thanks everyone for the nice comments and happy birthday wishes for him. I'll show him some of these tomorrow or Saturday (when I have more time). I'll try to reply to more comments tomorrow.  Edit2: I just showed the post to him, but before I summarize that, I just need to say that my mom got him to show me that he can swallow pills now, which is something we have been working on for YEARS. I was absolutely blown away, I'm so proud of him!  I showed him all the happy birthday messages, and he was so amazed that so many people liked his note. He laughed every time someone mentioned the P.S. I told him about all the different countries that people sent him well wishes from (he was particularly excited by Australia). I gave him a hug each time we passed a comment that said ""give him a hug from me"" (I still have yet to give him a hug for every year, but I'll get to that after we have cake).  Thank you all so much for all the nice comments, you made him really happy!"
My smile turned into a stupid grin when I got to it. I'm sure he didn't know it, but that appeals to my sense of humor so well.
"""please read this note"" Gave me a good chuckle"
Will do! I'll probably show this to him on Saturday.
He is tucked an hopefully falling asleep by now, don't worry.
My sister is coming home on Saturday for a proper celebration, so he wasn't upset that I had to work all day.
You're welcome :)
As disconnected as he can be from reality sometimes, he has unique a way of unintentionally putting the world into perspective.
My son is 13, non-verbal with Downs. For a kid that doesn't talk, he is hilarious and really just doesn't mess around getting his point across. As much as I wish he spoke, I'm almost afraid of what he'd say. He's so sarcastic without words, I can't imagine him with.
Work mail! Like a boring proper long official email and end it with 'P.S. please read this email'
Okay :)
I'm starting to feel like my hug was inadequate, but I'll give him another one tomorrow morning.
When I came up to the front door I heard him move, and for a second I thought he was trying to open his window (which is on the front porch, I walk right past it). He gave me a huge smile when I came in.
Thank you for sharing.(((((((💓))))))))  Edit: added more parentheses because of the comment. My heart surrounded by hugs (💓). The extra parentheses added is sending out even more love & positive vibes.   No idea about any anti-Semitic symbols. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Dude your brother is amazing, he knew you (a Redditor) would skip to the TLDR at the bottom. Perfect placement!
OP, may I please use this as my signature on my work e-mails?
He knew
And by the way, you’re an amazing big brother!
This is the kind of wholesome we need on the front page.  This is lovely.
"That's nice of him! I know autism manifests in many ways, but I have an autistic friend who HAS to celebrate on his actual birthday. It sucked when it was on a Wednesday during finals week.  When I tried to explain that more people would come to his party if he had it the Saturday after finals, he would say ""but that's not my birthday."" Celebrating another day just did not make sense to him."
What kind of autism does he have?
We calling emojis Jewish now?
In case you're unaware, the [triple brackets thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_parentheses) is an anti-semitic thing commonly used by the alt-right.  Please be careful.
I'd be offended if you didn't. I'm certainly going to, starting with the email I need to send to my CEO tomorrow
My mom is not autistic but she feels this way about Mother’s Day. I had a big exam coming up and asked to get together on the Tuesday after which was Apparently fine. Until she started crying on the phone when I called her on Mother’s Day...
He's very verbal, but lacks comprehension skills, any grasp of social cues at all, and he generally suffers from emotional instability and OCD as well.
I know animal enthusiast groups are using the triple parentheses to denote what an animal is thinking, so it's gotten to the point that for most people it's associated with cute and good things.
Til this. Also i would like you to know that you were very polite while providing this information.  So that was nice.
Great idea.  P.S. please read this comment
I hope that sticks but the “echo” as they call it is one of the most blatantly juvenile and cringey things the alt right has devised so I can’t help but laugh when I see it
It's important to be clear that you're coming from a place of making things better for everyone instead of some high-grounded moralism.  We're all in this together.
My smile turned into a stupid grin when I read this.

thats fucking awesome, i hope ill get a manager like this some day
I had to lay off my whole team once. The execs said myself and two people of my choosing could keep our jobs, if we relocated by the end of the month. I told the team the deal, including that I wasn’t going to take the deal but three of them could if they wanted. All of us said no, I bought time with the company, and we spend three weeks helping one another get new jobs. Everyone was at least interviewing by the end of the month when we all walked out. Maybe it’s dramatic but I really felt like I had to go down with the ship. Everyone is employed at much better companies now.
Nice. You probably could’ve started your own consulting firm and had some people follow you with that mentality.

Hate to burst everyone’s bubble but OP is full of it. They’re running a private cyber security contracting group. They make great money but get bounced around contracts all the time. They’re always in high demand; updating their resumes and references was just the normal course of business so they could bid on their next contract.

What kind of pizza was ordered?
or you could be that manager! follow your dreams paxu dont sell yourself short
I hope so too 
I’m glad the story turned out to have a happy ending 
No one will ever see this, but I do this for free for the visiting groups of local university intern-candidates at my hyper competitive company. You basically can’t get a job at my company despite a beyond bitchin resume unless you know someone (like I did). I pay it forward by spending each and every college “meet and greet” I’m assigned to run into a full blown resume-editing, application pep talk, system-debunking seminar that at least I can feel good about for an hour or two of my soulless existence.
Or you could pool everyone's money together and buy a ship and become pirates.  edit: thank you for the platinum!
The world would be a better place if everyone did 
Bless you
Yeah it sounded a little weird. Government contracts aren't renewed by week, the bidding process takes a long time and you know well beforehand if your contract is ending.
This guy’s xsited about pizza.   *misspelled the misspelling 
This made me laugh. Thanks!
Be the manager you want to see in this world
woah there dark and stormy...
That’s actually pretty motivating, thank you 
I hate so much about the things you choose to be
Its not telling the whole story. His wife (her mother) died earlier that year. She couldn't be home for Christmas and it was his first Christmas without his family. He decided to just be with his daughter Even though it meant sitting in a plane for days. Beautiful and heartbreaking 
That's beautiful and heartwarming. 😍
I never knew Hal was a person name.  Thought it was only my brother HAL9000
Super cute! ...how much is this costing him?!
She looks like Dillion Harper. 
He deserves the mug  *#1 Dad*
Hopefully he didn’t have to pay for all those tickets...
Man, I have a 5-year-old daughter and I’m constantly trying to find ways to properly express how much I love her and would do anything for her - this random beautiful and heartwarming story shows what I hope my dedication looks like some day.   All the money in the world can’t buy good parenting like this.
Yeah, Debbie doesn't do Dallas.
At least you know her address and bloodtype.
Wasn’t the dad from Malcolm in the Middle named Hal? Went on to divorce Lois(?) after the kids caused too much havoc, remarry, have another kid, get cancer, and start making some bomb ass meth?
Almost definitely free.   Flight attendants (and airline workers in general) and their families usually get either free or tax only flights where theyre only required to pay the taxes on the flight. So at most about 200?  I'd worry more about the boredom than the money. Holy fuck airplanes are miserable. 
That name is familiar, she some sort of famous scholar
That’s because you’re a stripper. 
I’m pretty sure flight attendants get huge employee discounts 
"Yo idea, you hire me, i ""fake kidnap your kid"". I'd just take them for like ice cream and back to my place and we'd watch movie, but then you break in through the window like super man and save them...  So they know you are superman. "
She can probably get him on the flights for cheap.
have you ever noticed that dallas backwards is sallad? because i just did
It just depends how attractive OP is.
"Depends on the airline and how her father is set up on her account.  Good friend of mine is a flight attendant for Air Canada. Her boyfriend (technically common-law as far as AC is concerned) can basically fly for free.\* Other friends and family can fly on passes, with the attendant has a set number of each year.  I flew first-class to Taiwan with my friend and her boyfriend recently. ~~I don’t think he had to pay anything.~~ I had to pay around $75. Not bad. (Correction: boyfriend also had to pay $75, but he's not limited to a set number of yearly passes like friends/family are).  \*Note: You're always flying standby and staff with higher seniority will always take priority over you. You think eBay sniping is bad? Just wait till you try ""flight to Tokyo roulette"" and a senior employee snipes your seat after you're already on the plane (but not left the gate yet)."
She specializes in ATM transactions, or so I heard from a friend
Well they get buddy passes and can give standby flights to immidiate family members iirc
My neighbor is a flight attendant.  They have a small house, older cars, two kids, not wealthy by any means.   They still take two vacations a year just because of the flight discount she gets.  Something like 75% off tickets.
That sounds fun, can I tag along?   Also > Ice cream  Username checks out 
only works when the flights arent fully booked and you usually only get to know this some hours prior to a flight. you really think they let every relative of a low pay job fly for free all over the place?
I used to do bags at a small airport. We were eligible for I.D.90 flights, which was 90% off. Up to 2 tickets at a time, not standby.   $1000 ticket for $100 equals a lot of passport stamps. I flew more in two years than I have in the decade since then.
Wow, that’s awesome. Did you get those benefits right away or did you have to spend a minimum period of time with the company?
My cousin got buddy passes for American Airlines when he was working for them in no time 
I've been told hearing is the last sense to go before someone passes. If so, she very well could have heard him. My dad was able to visit his mother in the hospital hours before she passed. She was unresponsive, but he sang her favorite songs to her and said he saw a tear fall along her cheek. I hope it's true.
My mom was in a coma after a very long battle with cancer. I talked to her for 3 days straight. During one of my sobbing bouts, she tilted her head a bit towards me and slurred, “oh, honey” in such a sad voice and tried to raise her arms, as if to hug me.  I stopped and rushed to her side. It was the first time she’d responded to me in days. She never spoke again after that, or made any indication that she could hear me. But after that I was convinced that she’d heard me the whole time and I didn’t stop talking until she died two days later.
Oh look it's Call Mom o'clock
/r/mademecry
Fuck. That pretty much just broke me. My dads funeral was today, and for the moment leading up to his death he was in and out of consciousness. I tried to spend a minimum of three hours a day with him, and would talk to him about me or my fiancé when he was asleep. I’d also relentlessly apologize, we didn’t have a good relationship and came in and out of each other’s lives a lot. I know I was (and probably won’t be) the son he ever wanted, but I tried so hard.   Be good to your dads if they’re in your life, you’ll be happy you were.
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Anybody have the link to the original post? I would love to see the other comments as well...
Damn, I got chills. So tender.
THIS DIDN’T MAKE ME SMILE 😭
Plausible, the reverse it’s the same. Don’t we hear first before waking up? Alarms, noises, etc. Death isn’t that hard for the deceased as for the living... even if they cannot hear us we know we said what we wanted to, and that’ll stick with us until our time comes.
"My grandpa was in a weird stupor/sleep in his final hours. We knew he could hear us, but never got a reaction. My cousin's boyfriend (and one of his marine buddies) said ""I gotta go, man. Semper Fi."" He sat up and his eyes opened and he went right back.  They totally can hear you. It was touching.  Edit: papa was far from stupid, unlike my hands."
God I hope this isn’t the case. Screaming at my father to wake up isn’t how I wanted his last moments.
My god. Now I’m crying, ugh, I’m so sorry, sending you love
I really wish I could. I'd love to hear her voice again.
Lol.  I said the same thing.
I’m actually tearing up now. Fuck I’ve had a rough day

Maybe its because hearing is the only sense where we don't have to do any action for it to work. Like to feel something you would have to touch it, to see something you have to open your eyes(dumb but makes sense for the waking up part) and so on.
Fucking ninjas cutting onions again
Holy shit. All you motherfuckers gonna make me cry after work? Sorry tho, I feel your pain all too much.
Not that dumb really. It’s not just opening the eyes.  Those eyes have to do a lot themselves as well. Focus, adjust for light level, point in the proper direction, etc.  The ear just sits there and gets vibrated.

"Fun fact: Stopping blood flow to the penis is actually an active mechanism.  It's why ""morning wood"" is a thing, because your body has relaxed and stopped the effort of turning that off.  So yeah, you will literally die hard."
That is absolutely heartbreaking and lovely at the same time. My sympathies for your loss and my respect to your brother for being a donor. It's so important to have these sorts of discussions when we're able to so family know how to answer. I hope knowing he's helping others to lead full and vibrant lives brings you some comfort. While I'm sure you were already proud of him, you should be doubly so now. x
The surgical staff that performs the procedure also get a letter with this information, and I kept a copy of every one of them during my tenure on the team.  Thank your family for honoring his life this way, and keeping him alive through other lives.
Wow that lady in NJ has been waiting since 2007. What an improbable and wonderful news it must have been for her and her family.   I'm sitting here with a smile on my lips and tears in my eyes.   All the best for you and your family.  
Goddamn it, reddit.  It's supposed to be all cute kittens and rainbows.  Seriously, though.  I'm so very sorry for your loss.  I'm absolutely crying for your family.  I'm crying for their families, though.  The lady from New Jersey.  She's been waiting 11 YEARS.  Can you imagine?  That horror, the terror, the fear your life may come to an end prematurely for 11 years, and then suddenly you get the call to come to the hospital right now?  And she's going to make a full recovery.  She's going to be fine.  The fear, the tether to the beeper for the last 11 years.  Her entire mindset for the last 11 years, it's gone.  She's going to be fine.  She's got a child (probably college age or older by now).  She's going to see her grandkids.  She's going to live to see them and spoil them rotten.  She may get to see her great grandkids.  She's going to travel and see the world.    The 32 year old male.  He's got a new heart.  He can marry, have a family if he'd like, grow old, hang out with his friends, go to sporting events, scream and shout and hug and everything he wants.  Daniel's heart will beat on for years and years and years.   I'm still crying for you guys, and for them.  This is sad and terrible and wonderful and so happy and all around amazing and awful.    I hope they reach out to your family and tell you how they're doing, and how Daniel is living on in them.    Only 1% can donate?  Goodness.  Please, if I die young, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, take everything you can.  Send as little to be buried as possible.  Ideally, so little would be left you could send me in a shoebox (no desire to be cremated).
I go in for knee ligament replacement surgery next week, I was told today by my surgeon that the ligaments would be donated by someone who is deceased. It's not like a new heart or other vital organs, but my quality of life is going to be drastically improved by someone willing to give like your brother. This was super humbling to read. Thank you OP
 I learned in therapy that losing a sibling is harder than losing a parent. They equate the loss of a sibling to losing a life partner (which is unnatural), whereas, we expect our parents to go before us. My older brother was my best friend also and lost him to suicide (Veteran at age 31).  He was O- blood type and was able to donate to only three people. From one empty sibling to another, I am so sorry for your loss and proud of your brother living on through others.  
Thank you to the person who gave me my first silver! And thank you all so much for all your kind words. It is really touching my heart and he would have loved all this attention. I'm adding a link to his obituary because it's too bad ass not to share.  [DJB](https://higginsfuneralhome.com/tribute/details/3435/Daniel-Bassillo/obituary.html#tribute-start)   Edit: I was stoked for my first silver. I am overwhelmed and utterly speechless from the amount of incredible people here. Thank you for the silver, gold, platinum, and ridiculous amounts of messages and comments. I'm working on replying to you. Also thank you to everyone who has signed up to be an Organ Donor. If there's one thing I learned it's that your entire life can change one day and you have absolutely no idea what can happen to you, for you, or someone else's family. It makes the pain a little bit bearable and it's so so worth it.   What a beautiful difference a single life can make.  
No you're crying.  As a doctor who has seen friends and patients lives transformed by transplants, thank you. 
thank you for saying all that. Like you said I was allready so proud of him and my heart hurts from losing him but this is the only good thing to come out of everything and I'm clutching onto the comfort of that for dear life. I really can't wait to meet the families my big brother saved and tell them all about how amazing and bad ass he was. 
that's really awesome to hear. I had a couple favorite nurses that held his hand when they pulled the plug and went the extra mile to make sure I knew they were there for him like I would have been if I could have. I'd like to think that they kept his letter. Thank you for being one of the good ones. 
In Texas, the Texas Organ Sharing Alliance sends the staff involved a similar letter with a little embroidered green ribbon.  Somewhere I have mine. 
Yet I as a recipient can never know about my donor.  I don’t get it. 
yeah I was actually wondering if that was a typo and was supposed to be 2017. either way, it's great that she finally received the organ she needed.
Not going to lie, I was doing OK until I saw the 1 year old and the 6 year old on the list, and now I’m just weeping over here.  The fear their parents must have felt and the relief when they got the call, all with the grief for the family that lost someone, and the gratefulness of their sacrifice is all too much for me.
I am so sorry that you know what this pain feels like. Especially if you guys were close too. My other older brother (I'm the youngest and only girl) is in the military too and I can't imagine losing him. My heart hurts for you and if you ever want to talk to someone who knows what you're going through feel free to message me. 
In lieu of Reddit Silver, I made a donation to www.Pawsandstripes.org
I'm already wearing jeans, but I just changed into my favorite flannel.  Peace to your family.  
Take care of yourself and your family over the next while. You're absolutely allowed to feel awful from this for how ever long it takes you, but it will get easier.  He sounds kick ass. Do him proud :)
You have to die in a certain way to even be considered.  Basically in a hospital and in a way that they can see it coming and prepare.  If you die at home or in an accident the organs die too fast to save.
I knew a lady whose baby (at the time, the little one's probably about eight or so now) needed a heart.  She was born with a congenital issue.  And she got the heart at seven or eight months.  In order for a baby to get a heart, you need a baby to die.  So there is absolutely relief that your baby will live, but you know that somewhere there is a family who is suffering the absolute worst of horrors that their baby has just died, and made the ultimate of selfless of choices to donate the organs.  And it's *just* happened.  When you've gotten that phone call it's fresh.  I can't imagine getting that phone call.  Relief and horror, all together.  And every time you look at your child as they grow, you have to relive it.  But you can't say no, don't do it, because that mean your child dies.  The worst thing is, I don't think the heart lasts forever.  Within 10 or 20 years she'll need another.  So you don't get to go through it once, your child lives their natural life through the multiple selfless decisions of other families.    If I was that child, growing up knowing that, I'd feel a need to cure cancer or something, just to make up for it.  Any parent having to go through it, but especially the ones of babies?  Oof.  I would hope all would do it, but my goodness, I hope I never have to.  I would, but please.  Take me instead.  So much easier to die than live with that.  Selfish, to be sure, but I don't know if I could live past the death of my child.    Edit: I was going to post happy subreddits, to cheer us all up, but dammit, this IS r/mademesmile!!!  GAH  So how about r/eyebleach?  r/aww  
you guys are fucking incredible. I'm speechless. 
"Thank you. We're all trying. I wasn't sure if I should post this but he's the one who introduced me to Reddit and I know he would say ""do it for the karma"" lol. But I really appreciate everyone's comments and didn't know how badly I needed to hear them and I wanted everyone to know how amazing he is. "
I have a friend whose 2 year old son died from a tragic head injury. They allowed everything possible to be used. They received a letter like this one that listed the other children who would live because her son had died. She keeps that letter close in her grief so she can remember that her son's heart is beating in the body of a little girl, his corneas allowed a man in Ireland to see his children clearly for the first time, and his liver and kidneys are giving 4 other kids a new life. 
Your brother seemed in good health, may I ask what took him from this world?
he had a severe asthma attack. i woke up to him screaming for help and i walked him to the car. my dad drove him to the hospital that's 5ish min away and half way there he passed out and died. they got his pulse back after 30 min and was on life support for about a week but he came back brain dead. the pain i felt the first day when the doctor told me and my dad he was gone after 20 min of trying to get him back was absolutely unbearable. i don't think i could have handled losing him all at once. i like to think God brought him back to us so that my family and his friends could say goodbye properly and i'm very grateful for that.  
As a 26 year old asthmatic, this scares me. Was he aware of his asthma? Was a rescue inhaler not helping?
He never even has asthma until about two years ago. He would just get these fits and was hospitalized once before about a year ago. I never ever thought it could kill him. He had an inhaler but it wasn't working. (the inhaler itself was working it just wasn't opening up his lungs or whatever they do.) It horrifies me thinking about it and I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little mad about how asthma is what killed him. but it's apparently a lot more serious than we all thought. 
I bet the person that had braille menus printed was really fucking excited too. 
Haha what a fucking idiot they forgot to put words on it. 
I own a restaurant... How do I get my menu made in braille? I'd love to offer this 
I want to know which restaurant but I know you aren't the OP. Still I would love if some Reddit sleuths found out for me a partial list of places that would do this. 
I worked a Friendly's years ago and we had one. Granted it was ONE and it was all the basic menu items, not the specials, but hey, better that than nothing. We also had a waitress who knew sign, so she always got the few deaf customers, but they always appreciated her.
I got set up on a blind date for this weekend. This place looks perfect. 
Order her some cheesecake, in that case! 
Yo that's dope
I learned recently that the majority of blind people in the US cannot read braille, because most diseases that would cause blindness in children are prevented through vaccines. Now, most people that become blind do so at a very old age, at which point it's kinda too late for them to learn.
"I know right? If I were a host/waiter I would be so excited to say ""Oh! I have a braille menu!"""
I'm blind and I can confirm this. Even McDonald's has them (used to?), and when an employee realises, they're so stoked. Even if they have a large print menu. A lot of servers will apologise for not having an accessible menu, and offer to read it to me, which is sweet.   What I do in cases where I can't read the menu (low light, bad font choice, etc.), I'll take a photo with my phone and look at it closer. This works especially well with chalkboard beer lists. 
welcome to reddit where you are REQUIRED to put /s at the end of every joke or everyone will apparently take you seriously
Are you blind? 
First Google hit: https://brailleworks.com/restaurants/  
Use a company called Precision Braille Plus out of Garnerville, NV. They did all of the menus a few years ago for a bunch of restaurants on the strip when the NCB held their convention there a few years ago. (At the time they were DBA Valley Braille Service.) I've worked with this company and HIGHLY recommend them. Very good work at reasonable prices.    775 226 8286  precisionbraille@gmail.com
If you really want to help visually impaired people dine at your own restaurant , you can have a menu webpage that is easily understandable using text to speech function. I undeserved that having a dedicated many for such people would mean a lot for them though.
this one in particular is Red Robin!
apparently Cracker Barrel and Olive Garden offer them too
I guess they couldnt get someone who writes in braille to transcribe daily specials.
I see what you did there.
Too smooth. She wouldn't be able to read it. 
Is it really too late to learn as an adult? My vision loss is speeding up, so I had kinda figured I'd start trying to learn Braille just in case. 
This. My restaurant has a braille menu option as well. Works couldn’t describe how elated i was to bust that bad boy out the first time 
I was excited to bust out the picture menu the first (and only) time I had an old Japanese man come to McDonalds to try to order!  He didn’t speak any English and I was like “hold up I know exactly what to do”
Wait if u blind how you see this post 
What does /s mean?
No but she is
Ty!! I'm on mobile and lazy hah much appreciated. 
I actually work for this company, good to see the stuff I worked on out in the world!
Cool :)
I work at outback and I know we have them at the host stand too!
I would think it’s a matter of how. I could see a chain doing it but your mom and pop probably would have an issue getting them made.
Brailliant
Never too late to learn something new. It’s only too late once you’re dead.
> braille speakers  🤔
"""Oh you're blind!? That's ***great***!"""
I offered a man a braille menu once when I was a server and he got pissed! He started really flipping me off in all sorts of ways I’ve never even seen before. We were able to calm him down pretty quickly, though. It turned out he was deaf. Good tipper, too!
Works can’t describe how elated you were to post this comment. 
My friend is blind and 99% of the time if we get a Braille menu it's horribly outdated :(
Pretty sure they are not completely blind just have bad enough sight to be considered blind
it stands for Sugandese
"""Whoa! Is this the bill or my phone number?""  ""It's a napkin."""
BTW, you can also have the menu in an ebook reader or smartphone with headphones.  Easier to update and accessible to blind / low vision people that can't read braille. And zoomable.  And you can DIY. Just google: create ebook in Word.   Keep it charged.
It clearly says [Red Robin](https://imgur.com/a/831K8yb) at the top of the menu.

That's a good thing, though. It's like landing on Community Chest in Monopoly.  Bank error in your favor: pay 1998 prices. 
Ooooor they have a computer program that lets them use computers / devices like everybody else.  They exist. 
What’s Sugandeez?
Listen here you little shit
My favorite part about this is that, even if the waiter convinced the person they just blinded with acid to order food instead of going to the hospital, they still wouldn’t know braille.
You have to pay for it now.
bro ur supposed to wait till they ask what’s sugandeez  E: he fixed it we’re in business now boys
I’m confused as how you can’t see that. 
So, what, it's just Gold but with zero of the benefits now?

I feel you. And it.
Ha! Goteem! We got you there u/bohdiii  didn’t we?
I really had to stop myself from making an EA joke.
Darn I got GOT 
I’m a grown ass man and I just now found out that it’s spelled “kindergarten” and not “kindergarden,” which means I’ve been pronouncing it wrong too.
"I asked my 3 year old niece ""what are you doing on Saturday?"" She said ""I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do any day!"""
I am very small and I have no money so you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.
Get you a man who looks at you the way the OP of this tweet looks at his dog
“I am very small, and I have no money, so you can imagine the kind of stress I’m under.”
"It's German. But the English ""kinder garden"" is also a phrase that means a very nice garden that forgives you.  Edit: word"
"To be fair, literally translating kindergarten to English gets you ""kid garden.""  You're not very far off the path."
LET ME GO BACK
r/expectedmulaney
Because Fridays are filled with weekend hype, and Saturdays just don’t live up to that hype. You wake up Friday thinking “hell yeah, it’s the weekend!” And that carries you through work/school. Then Saturday rolls around, and it’s fine, but usually nothing special.
I thought it was a garden of illegal chocolates. 
Is that why I'd rather die? Because I'm aware?
If the thing making you want to commit soduko is that you erroneously think childhood ignorance and lack of responsibility is a more desirable or worthwhile life than one of responsibility in the way of accountability, delayed gratification, and the meaningful rewards that such a life sows, then you're probably just depressed or very anxious. Not to trivialize those issues, however; they're both quite serious and should be worked at if possible.
Good on the kid for defending himself rather than conforming.
Jimbo: Haha, Nice PJs Simpson. Did your mommy buy em for ya?  Bart: Of course she did. Who else would have?  Jimbo: ...  Jimbo: Alright, Simpson. You win this round.
Reminds me of the guy on twitch who forgot to mute his mic before talking to his cat.  Edit: https://youtu.be/Cu64bx3L3OE
I’m gonna start saying, “I’m sad for you” from now on lol
I chirp my son playing Fortnight all the time. Can hear his friends say, “Is that your dad? He’s pretty funny.”  He tells them not to encourage me and he closes his door to his room.
"This is so great to hear!!!   I worked at school when my son was in elementary (K-6). I told him I would always ignore him unless he initiated contact so I didn't embarrass him. The first week of school, in the lunch line (line was long with mixed grades), he stepped out of line and gave me a hug and told me he loved me. There were a lot of ""ooooohs"" and ""oh, nos"" from some in line. My son turned and said, ""It's my mom and I get to do that whenever I want. Get over it."" I had to step out of the room for a sec to keep it together.   LOL talk about timing, he just text me and told me he loved me. I raised a great man.  Edit: OMG my first silver! Thank you, this absolutely made my day. You are a gem!  Edit2: Holy cow **GOLD**! I've never been given gold before. Thank you very much !! Wow, I will have to share with my son and tell him he helped me earn gold! Wooohooo!  Edit3: Formatting"
"I remember a point as a kid when I had one of my ""rebellious"" edgy bursts and told my mom I hated her. Probably because she didn't let me do something or whatever.   My ""cool"" uncle (who I was pretty close to in age, he's only about 8 years older than me, so when I was 13~ here he was like 21), who I totally idolized, came down on me HARD. Gave me the whole ""don't you ever disrespect your mother like that man"" thing, made me feel so bad.   Despite my cool edginess I never treated her like that again, not even kind of."
My last words with both my mom and my dad were “I love you” (seven years apart). I’ll always be grateful for that fact.
Yeah I always do that no matter who's listening. I love my mama. Don't know bout yall but this woman carried me for nine months and birthed me. Damn right I love her.
Way to you go your kid!!!  Mine does the same also then tells off the other players mocking him 😁  Not quite to the words your son did, which are pretty epic! What a take down haha!!  My teen is 15. I'll suggest your son's phrase to him for next time 🤣
If that's not a indicator of good parenting right there then I don't know what is
Fight the power!
Good on his parents for teaching him how to show appreciation.  Needs to be more common than it is.
Abe: I'd hug ya, but I'd probably just embarrass you.  Bart: I don't care who knows I love my grandpa.
Hey man, he’s raggin on your cord!
That's pretty wholesome.
A co-worker caught me singing to a dog once.  It was the dreidel song, but with the word dreidel replaced with beagle.
I do that to my cats whenever I leave for work. I give them some neck scratches, the friendlier one gets a kiss on the head, and I tell them “Bye guys, I love you. I’ll be back later, I promise.”
Link?
this warms my cold dead heart
what do you mean by chirp?
BRB I'll just be in the corner thinking about my broken family.
Cool uncle indeed
It’s nice when the person you look up to as a badass as a kid decides to use their powers over you for good.
it’s great that you love her, u/daddythiccdicc0197, but i don’t think that’s a reason for loving one’s mother. billions have done it and many turned out to be awful parents, undeserving of love.   having children is something one typically does out of their own aspirations. it is not selfless to have a child, it’s their choice because they hope it fills their life with love. but that alone does not earn one unconditional love.   my point is... someone can carry me for a hundred years but if i come out and they suck, it’s not on me to love someone who sucks.
I normally don’t remember user names but I recognize you from previous posts.
Hey fun boys, get a room!
Are you an African swallow or a European one?
I do this but then also tell them to “Be excellent to each other”.  Which is my way of saying not to beat up on each other or fight too much while I’m gone lol. 🤣

I'm so sorry I made you feel that way. Can I virtually adopt you?  Your response made me sad because I believe all children deserve loving families, whether by birth or otherwise. To me, family is not always related by blood, but by demonstrative love and respect.  Edit: Silver?? Two for me in one day?? I am over the moon. I appreciate your thoughtfulness!  Edit2: Gold?? Holy cow I am humbled beyond words. Thank you to the redditor who thought enough of what I had to say to gift it to me!  Edit3: Holy shit platinum? I thought I was humbled with the silver, and then the gold. I humbly thank the person who gave the platinum to me. It has made my day and i am grateful beyond measure. I will pay it forward as much as I possibly can. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

Looks like a migrating one.
Oh my God. That was adorable! Thank you so much!
Now I’ll recognize this one.  Edit: I think I saw it on a r/rimjob_steve post a few months ago. It’s also not a joke account, it’s exactly what it claims to be.
I loved everything about this! Sounded like he wasnt embarrassed and his friends were just laughing cause it was funny,  not laughing *at* him
Imagine the excitement of those kids. Amazing
My brother had to move from his old neighbourhood, after a couple of months they were visiting us, I took his kids for a car ride with me around city, and my niece spotted her old neighbour and friend, I've never seen her as happy and elated in a while, she basically started yelling and laughing and calling her friend hysterically haha.
Barrett Is like a really badass name, what a lucky kid :)
Nice !
As the parent of a 5 yo, this makes me smile big big.
Everyone liked that
The dad seems adorably excited too
Did you let her out?
"For one of the products we have at work there was a tech support guy named Barrett. He was super polite and nice and competent but I got the feeling he called his dad ""sir""."
Sheeeeit. Have you seen the cost of private school? If this were my kid, I'd have had to just tell them the value of making new friends, cause that old one is dead to you now.
I spent too long looking for the dad in the picture... rough morning
"He stepped on the gas and yelled ""Let the past die. It's the only way to become what you're meant to be.."""
His father my have been to enamored by the Barrett .50 Cal he named his son after it
I mean, you can see the dad’s picture in the top left corner of the image...
"When I was in high school my mom's solution to my social woes was to say, ""don't worry, after high school you'll never see any of these people again."""
Or a Final Fantasy 7 fan.
If you stare long enough you will see his reflection...
>Let the past die. It's the only way to become what you're meant to be..  Speaking from my experience, she wasn't wrong 🤨
Went from giving customers heart attacks to saving customers with heart attacks.  Good business model 👍
My first job was bussing tables.  I also cleaned toilets at a hospital, and worked various factory jobs for minimum wage.  Now I make good money in finance, but if a toilet is clogged in the bathroom, I have no problem going in and clearing it.  Biggest thing I learned from working those earlier jobs is that some people don't give you the time of day because they think they're better than you.  Being completely ignored like you're nothing sucked.
No this isn’t me!!! I just found it somewhere and thought it was nice :)
I worked my way 'up' through the healthcare industry, from cleaner to staff nurse since I was 16 years old. It makes you appreciate how every singe person is fundamental to your industry, and how everyone deserves respect for what they do. Stay humble x
I love this! In my hospital I started as cleaner, then a kitchen assistant, then healthcare, and now nurse. My plan is when I’m Matron is to a) do a vine dancing to Drake’s “started from the bottom now we’re here” and b) understand and have empathy to all staff in my team as I’ve literally done their job!
Yes... this is KFC Corporate. If you could return those name badges to your nearest KFC, that'd be great. Thanks.

Probably most appropriate place to need a nurse, dealing with cardiac, diabetic, and gastrointestinal issues.
I think everyone should work at least one shitty job for a short while, really humbles you.
By “somewhere” do you mean the second top post of all time on r/getmotivated ? Lol  Edit: Some people took this comment way too seriously. OP obviously found the post somewhere else.
I understand that as a nurse you probably don't have enough time to keep up with these things, but vine isn't around any more...
Agreed. I think people should be forced to do one service job just so they can learn how close to total fucking animals most people are.
No I was not aware it was there, you know it’s common for things to recirculate the internet!
OP’s post has a larger picture of that version with the [caption](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/8zyre7/image_slow_and_steady/?st=JPSW4GRL&sh=a0c7ed1f) , so they most likely did find it somewhere else
If everyone was forced to, maybe they wouldn't be total fucking animals in the first place. The world would be a better place.
Idk about this. I work in a hotel, and I have flight attendants regularly be more rude than normal guest. They don't pay for anything and get better benefits/additional perks than regular paying guest. Flight attendants should be the most sympathetic considering they are the one other job having to deal with the same type of bullshit guest and out of control circumstances as we do.
Really guys?? I saw something nice and I re-shared, even if I did get it off /getmotivated (which I didn’t though), I’m just resharing something nice!! I did not know this was illegal!!!
I don’t mean to stereotype, and I’m happy to be corrected, but from my experience with flight attendants, they’re nice enough o the flight but have a holier-than-thou attitude otherwise. It’s the exclusive industry for the beautiful people and they have the sense of entitlement that goes with being a part of that. 
I've never seen this before. Thanks for sharing
It's a power trip. On the plane, they're the group of people in control. Cause trouble? They make it double.
I saw this episode, she's really cute. 
Jerry: SHES BALD?  George: BALD JERRY!  Elaine: YOURE BALD!  George: *pointing to toupee* I *was* bald  Edit: thank you for the silver

My sister has alopecia and struggles with a lot of panic attacks because of it.   This really warms the canyon where my heart should be. <3
And all the time the dude is thinking ... is her hair gone *everywhere* on her body?
My sons wife has this. She’s beautiful and doesn’t wear a wig. Just goes out as herself. This lady is beautiful. She doesn’t need a wig. 
She's gorgeous, both with and without, I would have told her to leave it off too.
I wish my mother could have had this confidence. She lost all her hair at 26, passed away at 84. There was not one day I've been alive that I didn't hear her express some lament and mourning over the loss of her hair. She had a lot of issues.  Edit: Wow! This thread really blew up more than I expected! Thank you to everyone who shared, strength in numbers, yeah? My heart breaks for every one of you who have had to experience unexplained hair loss, yet rejoices that so many who have suffered are (most likely, hopefully) now empathetic to others experiencing pain, whether emotional or physical. We start out in life as clean slates. DNA has some degree of determining how we exist, but I believe the experiences we have are huge contributors to how we live our lives and how we treat others. Nature vs nurture. I honestly believe that if everyone lived so-called perfect lives, the planet would have waaaaay more a-holes than it already does.   Just be kind to one another. Don't judge. Every person you meet is fighting some kind of battle.

I have alopecia. Shaving my head was the best thing I’ve done. I can’t control my hair falling out, but I can control some hair clippers. https://i.imgur.com/tYUZLiJ.jpg 
She looks like Sophia the talking robot
"Him: ""Wow that's great. I'm also bald. I wear a wig too!""  Her: ""Check please."" "
She is so cute
My wife always jokes that she hates her hair and she's just gonna shave it all off like that would be bad. I say she'd still look beautiful with a shaved head wearing a trash bag lol

My second dates: I’ve had breast cancer, double mastectomy with reconstruction. They had to take my nipples so they are tattooed on. I’m smooth like a Barbie doll.  I don’t do showsies in public LOL. You learn a lot about a person when revealing things like this. 
Didn't she decide not to go out with him again? I seem to remember this.

Being confident with something like this is hard, so I understand why she wears it. Also having hair is just fun sometimes. However she chooses to do it I hope she feels confident
I agree with you u/scratchyNutz  I relate a little to this. I’m deaf in one ear. So I, too, have a very real, day-to-day annoyance in my life. You never go a day without thinking about it.   When I would go on dates I always needed to sit/walk on the right of whomever I was with. Since there is no visual cue to my deafness, they often forget and I shift around so I can hear and listen to them better. I got so used to them smiling with dead eyes as I did this. Always amplified the awkward.  Fast forward to when I started hanging with my now-fiancée. I was telling her all the little irritating things being half deaf makes me self conscious about.   She proceeded to say that she loves my “little hearing dance” that I do (walking or scooting to a better place to hear) because she knows that I really want to listen to her and hear what she says. Last time I shed a tear... at least until I hear her say “I do” ;)  
That’s brutal, sorry you had to deal with that
Oh thank god I’m not the only one who thought it. 
Who the hell needs a head of hair with eyes like that anyway
You remind me of Anne Hathaway! 
He just watched Ex Machina earlier so he's into it 
What's with calling everyone who doesn't like that she gave up on him for being too nice for incels?   I mean it's her decision but the word incel is just overexaggerating and toxic.  
Yes. I guess he should have been like “Lol what’s up baldy?”
She says she's too nice, but declined a second date because he was too nice 🤔
"Yeah I might be wrong but I'm sure it had something to do with him being ""too nice"""
Wtf is up with all these incel replies to your comment. 
Being nice does not guarantee getting another date. It just means you are a decent human being. This should be default behavior. Default behavior does not guarantee attractiveness. It doesn't guarantee compatibility. It just means that you're not an asshole.
"Just because someone has some unusual personal feature that is ""exposed"", and that is lovingly accepted by the other person, is not enough of a reason to ""be"" with them. It is likely the person with this feature has come to terms with it themselves, and they still have a normal range of feelings about potential partners that they would or wouldn't have with or without their unusual trait. "
Television!
Shows called ‘First Dates’ on Channel 4 in UK 
I love that the old lady Elaine was talking with said she did this exact same thing with Gandhi.
He will surely find someone that appreciates that about him 
"People are getting all personally enraged at ""too nice"" but the fact is that's a very real thing. For men and women alike. I've met plenty of ""nice girls"" and I've known many ""nice guys"". I used to be one, I'm man enough to admit it.   If ""he's too nice"" pisses you off, I really urge you to look in the mirror. Because that's a very bad sign for you.   There's a difference between being a nice person with a unique and individual personality, and being a person who has ***made*** ""nice"" their personality. The latter feels like a very shallow, boring person (because they are), at best. Nothing wrong with being that, but it's not interesting. At worst it's a big red flag that they've got something to hide.   And when you start getting personally offended at being called nice (boring, uninteresting) and you turn that into your personal crusade, you've become an incel. Or at least you're on the track for it. You're blaming other people for your lack of a personality with any depth.   The whole notion of being offended at that word, ""nice"" (as in 'boring and uninteresting') is telling, because boring and uninteresting are subjective words. Your hobbies and likes might be interesting to some, but not others. And the expansive number of hobbies and interests means that most *won't* find it interesting. But some will. That's life, as they say. That shouldn't surprise anyone.   Now when you step back with that logic and apply it to the incel mentality, something gets brought to light. The incel mentality thinks that there's an objective ""nice"". They think that women *all somehow agree on what they're looking for*, which is about as unrealistic as it gets. See? They've built an image of ""this is what women want"" *without ever asking women.* Like making a Star Wars movie about Jar Jar by himself ""because there were so many memes"". It's a big red flag that screams, ""I'm in it for me, not you, I'm not paying attention to you"". And no one wants their relationships to work that way.   They have applied a standard for the world impossible to meet: that not just *one*, but *any* woman they encounter *should* appreciate them. And the cycle continues.  Tldr love yourself and focus on you; ""nice"" stops being the best thing anyone will ever say about you, and people recognize the stark difference between a nice person without any personality, and a person with an interesting and rich personality of a person who is also a decent human being.

Thanks! I still have my brows and lashes for now- small blessings!
I feel that they made a friendly connection. Not really a romantic one. But I would have needed a second date to corroborate those feelings you know? Usually it takes me a couple of dates to see if a person is a potential partner.
Well... this just ruins everything 
"For the record too nice is often a way of saying  there wasn't a sexual attraction and wants to let him down easy. This seems to have stirred a few people up in this thread from the ""nice guys"".   Additionally, TV dating is almost always scripted. To the sentence. Dated a girl who had been on a show and she was amazed at how much they told her to say. "
Read that as “incel reptiles” at first.
Man how the hell could I tell they were English from the gif? Was it the way they moved their mouths?
He’s in a weird situation, cameras all up in his face and girls ripping off their hair.  I’d probably act the same.      “I wear a wig”      😬😬 “Ok.”  😬😬      *takes off wig*      😬😬 “oh wow.” 😬😬
I'm sure she appreciated that about him, it just wasn't enough to make her romantically attracted to him. I found a great comment elsewhere in the thread:  > Nice is what you call someone when there's nothing more interesting to say about them. Nice means the only thing they had to say about you is you fulfilled being a decent human being.  Being nice isn't enough. It's the baseline. Ideally, you should also be fit, successful, intelligent, and fun to spend time with  edit: yes, those qualities are relative. No, I'm not saying that there's a magic formula. Yes, there are unattractive ways to be intelligent (obnoxiously so), fit (too much time in gym + never eating nice meals with partner), successful (too much time at work and so too little time for partner), etc. No, I don't think it's an issue to talk with other guys about how certain traits make it more likely (**not guaranteed**) that women will be romantically attracted to you. Honestly, those are traits that we all should be cultivating for our own internal satisfaction anyways, so them making you more attractive is just icing on the cake
Exactly! Just because she wasn't digging him doesn't mean there isn't millions of girls out there who wouldn't fall head over heels for him.   He'll find his one someday 
Awwww thanks! Well as we fuck off into the sunset, I’ll do some one handed sign language in your direction, with a full heart and a smile on my face :)

"^ this. Being too nice and too passive can still hurt your social life, without also having to be some sort of secretly manipulative monster.  Edit:  Speaking from my own experience as a former nice guy, I had no real sense of what healthy assertiveness looked like. I didn't want to be like one of those ""pushy assholes"", so I went to the opposite extreme - I tried to be the nicest, most laid-back person possible. I listened to classical music instead of rap. I watched anime instead of ""trashy reality TV"". I prided myself on being ""different"" from mainstream culture. These things weren't bad in their own, but looking back I realize that I was trying very hard to be the opposite of what I saw most of my peers doing. I never pushed for sex - hell, I had no idea how to present myself as a sexual being. I had only one tool in my toolbox to relate to girls - niceness - and didn't understand why I was so unsuccessful.  I don't think that most ""nice guys"" are trying to play some weird mind games to get sex. They are trying their hardest to attract a romantic partner, but lack the social skills and self-awareness to do so in an effective, healthy way. They approach dating like how you would try to win over a romantic partner in a video game: ""if I say enough nice things, give them enough gifts, and never say the wrong thing, eventually they will fall in love with me.""  Edit 2:   I've had a few people ask me how I've broken out of the ""nice guy"" mindset, so I wanted to write up some of the things that have been helpful for me. In all honesty, I still struggle with being a people-pleaser. It's something that I'm continuing to work on, particularly conflict-resolution. I've had some painful but instructive life-experiences that have helped me to break away from my old mindset. Therapy has been extremely eye-opening, and I wish that I had sought it out a long time ago. My wife is also extremely helpful: she can instantly tell when I'm being ""fake-nice"" (aka people-pleasing), and she pushes me to prioritize being authentic. Here are a few lessons that have been extremely helpful for me:  * ""Niceness"" often comes out of place of fear, not genuine kindness. I was nice because I was afraid of people not liking me. I was **avoiding disapproval**, not earning approval for who I am. In reality, niceness was actually impeding me from having the kinds of relationships that I wanted, because I was afraid of being more authentic.   * My self-worth is not dictated by other people's opinions of me. In fact, people tend to like me more when I'm my real self, not who I think they want me to be. People are attracted to authenticity, and they can usually pick up on ""fake niceness"".   * My wants and needs are just as important as anyone else's, but I need to communicate them. Refusing to express myself will create false expectations for the other person, and can eventually lead to pent up feelings of unfulfillment or resentment.    * ""Nice"" is different from ""good"". Sometimes being nice is actually unkind - it can be false or inauthentic. Trying to make everyone happy often results in doing more harm in the long run.     * Sometimes it's okay to make other people upset or disappointed. It's often better to be upfront about what you can and can't (or will and won't) do, rather than make false promises. When you set healthy boundaries and stick to them, people tend to respect them in the long run. If they habitually violate those boundaries, then that's a pretty good sign that they would have walked all over you if you if you hadn't set those boundaries.   * IT'S OKAY TO BE REJECTED. My particular brand of niceness comes out of a fear of failure and rejection. Being nice allows me to minimize my vulnerability, but also prevents me from taking necessary risks. I've had to learn that it's okay to get rejected. It's okay for people to not like me all of the time. This has freed me to focus more energy into the people and things that matter most to me.   Lastly, I'm going to plug a podcast that I think really nailed these concepts: ""Shrink for the Shy Guy"" did a great series of episodes on niceness called ""NOT NICE"". The first one is [here](https://www.shrinkfortheshyguy.com/not-nice-what-nice-really-is/). The speaker used to have social anxiety himself, and the way he explored those ideas really felt spot-on to me. I'd highly recommend checking it out.   I hope this helps!"
The trouble is, it’s true of nice girls sometimes too. Nice is good but it’s not very interesting without other qualities 
had this issue with my wife. she was friendly, seemed to like me, but resisted any romantic intention. was incredibly disappointing to me, but realizing i was trending into creeper territory i backed of. and decided to move on. a few days of radio silence and then she reached out and said ok we'll try it.  fast forward about a decade, she finally tells me that she was resistant because i represented everything she imagined she wanted -- but didn't see herself settling down until well into her 30s. i was 100% marriageable material, she could see her self having kids with me...house with a picket fence, mini van, Christmases...the whole shebang. but she wanted to enjoy life first.   apparently what changed her mind was her brother asked what happened to me and she said she wasn't ready for me. he told her she was stupid, and deserved to die alone with a bunch of cats and that i wouldn't be there when she was ready and she'll regret this for the rest of her life.   so...what's the lesson? i can't say exactly. i think marriage and commitment means surrendering part of your life for something greater. some people aren't ready for the sacrifice when its presented to them.   being 'nice' doesn't mean a potential partner owes you anything. on the same token, life is what happens to you when you're making other plans... my only advice to people would be to open themselves to happiness. can't tell you how many people i've met at mid life that did everything 'perfectly' and are miserable. 
Ok I’m not an expert but if you walk in and your date does the face she did when he walked in, just walk right out. The too nice was definitely not the reason 
Some people just aren't a good match. It's really sweet that he was happy with her looks without the wig but that isn't going to automatically make them a match.
"Not disagreeing with that, I do suspect a number of guys won't react to ""I just don't find you attractive"" very well though. "
Pull out his di ck and say I'm a little short too
Whenever I felt uncomfortable at a date whether it was because i was worried if i was out of my league or just forcing it a little too much, I'd come off this way. I wouldn't get a second date and I'd think about it go yeah ok, i was boring as fuck. Sure i was fine. I was courteous but Jesus, i couldn't let my personality out of the bag cuz i felt worried at the time. Dating is a hard game. I got in my own way a lot. 
That's why I became a smart-ass.  All the actions of a nice person, but I get to talk shit the whole time.  I will help anyone do anything as long as I can complain about it.
">too passive  I think this is what most people mean when they say ""too nice."" No one wants an SO who's a lump and just sits there agreeing to everything. ENGAGE ME"
" As someone who was often accused of being ""too nice"" in my youth, I can tell you that what people were often telling me, was that I was a pushover, came across as having low self-esteem, or wasn't clear about my boundaries until someone hurt me.  I think ""too nice"" is a euphemism for not being your authentic self and presenting as having low self-esteem.    Kind, generous thoughtful men are always in demand, but I think ""nice"" is a term that is meaningless and is often the go-to way of being in the world for people who don't have the confidence to be themselves, and or be honest about that boundary lines."
"Theres a big difference between being a nice guy and a good guy. A nice guy gets walked all over, a good guy has the ability to say ""no, thats not ok"".   Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to be an asshole, or even a bit of one, you just need a spine.   The 'nice guy' meme is about boys who put nice coins in, and expect sex out. This is a bit different to a guy, who is just too nice, but its actually fairly easy to cross the line, as soon as you start thinking, ""why isn't this working"" you're in meme territory.   So, what does this mean? If you don't want to be an asshole (and good, there are too many), stop confusing being nice with saying yes to everything. Have some lines, bendable lines, but lines, don't get walked over. And be interesting, have something to say, to do, to live that you're interested and engaged in. Have values and don't be affraid to walk away. "
"When someone says someone else is ""too nice"" they usually mean something else but don't want to say it.  Like they're boring to them or not that attractive but they're very kind so they don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. "
Siblings have the benefit of not having to censor themselves.  I'm hoping she's realized that marriage doesn't mean being chained, and that just because you're married doesn't mean you can't have an exciting life. 
Letting my personality out of the bag found me a wife. 
"This is me! It takes me several dates for me to be comfortable around someone new. I'm a nice guy, but I'm not a ""nice guy."" I know this because I blame myself for my social short comings and end up self hating myself for not letting my weird personally shine, if not just a little bit.   And anyways first impressions are important so I'm not going to go off the deep end on the dynamic relationship between Batman and The Joker and how The Dark Knight shows the duality of control and chaos. Gotta ease into the geek side."
This! Just because you're nice doesn't mean you're interesting. It's a tough lesson
Have you ever not dated a girl cause she was “too nice”, cause I sure as shit haven’t,   Sounds like rationalized bullshit to me.
It’s the life man. Everybody will tell you you’re a dick but deep down you know it’s all love and I’ll help anybody out as long as I can bitch and moan 
Yes, I feel like ‘nice’ as a description can imply ‘boring’ honestly. Compassionate, empathetic, easy to get on with, are all more promising. Niceness can often bleed into being passive or unremarkable, or sometimes not having or showing your own opinions 
I'd venture to say she did the wig thing to throw him off and kinda end it there
1:34 to 1:35  That’s the smile I give the student that keeps spilling shit in my lab when they say hello to me in public 
Letting my wife out of the bag found me a personality
"I partially agree with you, in that I understand wanting to ease into the geek side. But I think there's a lot of merit to going straight to the stuff you're passionate about. I see one of two* (edit: three lol) outcomes:  1. Best case scenario? She's into it and wants to talk nerd shit, which is really what you want right? Because who doesn't want a relationship where they can geek out and feel comfortable about it?  2. Next best (honestly it's tied for first, so another best case scenario)? She's not into the topic itself, but she still enjoys your *passion* about things. People aren't always going to be into the same stuff you are, but interesting people enjoy hearing other interesting people being passionate about something! And who knows, maybe over time she'll learn to appreciate it as you learn to appreciate some of her passions, even the ones you may not have initially enjoyed. That's the great thing about meeting new people, there's always a chance to learn more about them and more about yourself.  3. Worst case scenario (secretly just another best case scenario)? She's not into it, she's not into your passion, and the whole thing turns her off. Good, fine. Whatever. That's not a person you'd be happy with anyways! It's a problem that immediately solves itself, one that really only exists if you let it exist (not to be trite). If she learns to like and appreciate a version of you that isn't really 100% you (not necessarily lying, but omitting), you'll have the difficult process of slowly introducing your true self to her over the course of the relationship.    As someone with general anxiety this last scenario is where I would get stuck with those feelings of doubt, and that's OK. Learning to be true to yourself takes time and it's a learn as you go kind of thing, so there *will* be relationships where you learn more about who you are and have the opportunity to share that with your partner. That's exciting though! That's the whole point of relationships, right? But to get to the good stuff, the real meat of the relationship (whatever form or fashion that relationship may take) as quickly as possible, you might as well lead with what you already know about yourself to be true. In your case, create an opportunity to talk about movies and whip out that dope Dark Knight analysis. If it's something worth spending time with they'll appreciate you showing them the real you. And if they don't appreciate you showing them who you really are? Then they're not someone worth spending time with.   Didn't expect this to be as big of a response as it turned into, but this is something that *I'm* passionate about (the word ""passion"" has lost all meaning to me at this point I've written it so many times) and have recently been working through myself. I hope you appreciate the unprompted advice, and if not then I want you to know that this does not come from any kind of judgment or condescension. Just one man expressing his thoughts in the hopes of making some microscopic discreet unit of good in the world, and everyone is allowed to feel however they feel."
"Yes.  If someone is boring or clingy or whatever, just say that instead of making up a nonsensical euphemism.  If they're actually ""too nice"", see a therapist about why you want to be mistreated so badly."
I'd counter-venture there is a decent chance he wasn't even in the restaurant at that stage and she is glancing at something/someone else, and it's just been cut together to look like that. 
Letting my personality out of my wife found me a bag
Having fun wasn't hard when I got a library card 
Even though it will never be said out loud, I hope my spouse feels the same way about me. 
My grandfather's handwriting looked just like this with the random capital letters and very straight lines. I wonder if it is generational?  He was a romantic too. My grandmother died after giving birth to my mom, and he still kept her picture on his bedside table and didn't take off his wedding ring for the next forty years until he died. He was a very loving man. 
In the middle of a silly argument with my husband. We’ve been avoiding each other all morning. Gonna go hug him now!
I didn't sign the permission slip for this feel trip
I can’t wait to have love like this. Thanks for giving me hope.
Oof my heart... 
"My grandfather died when my dad was 14. His ashes were spread on a spot at a local cemetery. My grandmother never remarried and supposedly never even dated again.  40+yrs later, my grandmother died. We spread her ashes on the same spot her husband was. Then, we went inside some building at the cemetery I didn't know about.  Apparently, this is where they kept personal records for the deceased. These books would have the name of the deceased, their date of death, a small note. and who they were ""survived"" by. Oftentimes there were spaces under their name for their spouses to be placed upon death.  My dad found his father's entry, and the space below for his mother. The note next to his dad said simply ""Till we meet again."" I asked my dad what we were going to write for his mum, though through welling eyes I already knew.  ""We meet again"" is all he said, and that was probably only the second or third time I've ever seen my dad cry. I bawled quietly as he wrote it all in the book. I never knew my grandfather, but I knew my grandmother very well. She'd always been content with my dad and us, never seemed to have any regrets. She read *tonnes* of romance novels. Sometimes she would say in a jovial tone that she's ready to move on and I would balk, but she'd just say ""You'll understand when you're older.""  I never knew the love they shared but it must have been something powerful. They were from a generation of Brits that didn't share their feelings as openly as later generations, so I know those few words scrawled in that book mean way more than their brevity might imply."
Im not crying, you're crying 
Fuck
This is what matters in life not everything else. 
I want this so bad. I'm a good person, working on myself. I'm 40. (Divorced 10 years ago).   I will have it one day, but right now, I'm working on myself.   This really did make me smile. 
/r/Frisson 
My heart. 
I do.
Try saying it out loud 
Just eat her ass instead. Sometimes actions speak louder then words.
Omg.... my heart.. 
my grandpa always wrote in all caps with straight lines!
My grandfathers, and my father, and myself all write that way. It started for me working in machine shops, they worked in shops as well. But I imagine it crosses over into other trade work too. When your handwriting has to be explicitly clear.   It's like a mechanical drafting sorta thing. I actually first made the connection in a drafting class in middle school. When we spent a while week just writing the alphabet like this. I'm only 27 btw this would have been 99-01 I think.   I do the same thing with the random capitals. My brain wants everything capital, so I end up mixing the lower case and capital letters all over if I'm not careful.  
This is the hardest and easiest thing you’ll do today.
I love that about reddit sometimes. Helps give perspective to the bigger picture and get over life's minor speed bumps. 
None of us did, we're just along for the ride.
I hope it finds you
"I found it last year. I'm 34 and had given up on finding love. I had kind of decided that I wasn't meant for it. I dated a lot and felt that maybe things I did in my 20s, or my personality, pickiness, etc. meant I'd never be truly in love. ""I just wasn't wired that way.""   Then I met her and it all clicked. She understands me like no one else ever has. I tell her everything, even the things I'm ashamed of, scared of, have anxiety about. The things I didn't let another partner know. I allow myself to be vulnerable with her and I'm met with love and support. I've never experienced anything close to what I have with her. Honestly, I'm still not even sure how the fuck it happened, but I'm madly in love and just fall deeper in every day. She's become my best friend. Definitely doesn't hurt that she's an absolute knockout either.   Long story short, be patient, be open to it, and don't give up hope. We all move at our own paces in life. "

Me too.
Probably just emotionally inarticulate. That’s not a bad thing. Someone like that can get a lot across simply by giving a certain look or touch.
I'm not crying. I'm making a lasagna...
Was your grandpa an engineer?  My dad used to draft electrical blueprints before computers were a thing and he wrote in all caps with very straight lines as well.  He said it's how they learned to label things on the blueprints.
The hug or the husband after the hug?
I hope it finds everyone 
hol up
"My boyfriend and I both get somewhat awkward about expressing deep emotions sometimes, though we both know they're present. What he does that I love is leave little sticky notes around in places I'll find them. They don't have to be poetic or profound, just something to say ""I was thinking of you."" It's cute. You don't have to be emotionally articulate to express how you feel <3"
this doesnt make sense but is hilarious

Aw, you can see how hard she's focusing.
I’m glad that no one has posted a mean comment yet, this is adorable
I love watching kids problem solve and think through stuff like this! It's so awesome to see their thought process!
Now that’s a legit victory dance.

Okay here I come:  This is the worst sorting algorithm I've ever seen
It really is mind-blowing. It's like you can see her experimenting with new solutions and watch neural pathways form in realtime.

i seen some cute shit today but this is the cutest by far. give grandma a big high five for me. 
"She's saying ""ficou lindo demais"", ""it's so beautiful"". I love her, so cute :')"
Mint green. I feel like this was a very specific color request and she was thrilled that they got it perfectly how she wanted.
Wow so many nice comments!! You guys are awesome <3
Good for her!!! Just because you are older   have fun, try new things   enjoy life!  
/r/HumanTippyTaps 
Made me smile too! Yay!
Earlier today I actually said the words “I don’t think I will ever smile again.”   But this made me smile pretty hard. Thanks for sharing.  Edit: thanks for the silvers and the gold, kind Redditors. I am so pleasantly surprised by all the support I’ve gotten over this comment. You’re a good bunch of people. 
If you have naturally white hair, why not use it?  Looks awesome! Show her something multi coloured if she wants to redye sometime. :)
Rockin it, Grandma!
Did you see the one where the family gives the old grandpa some shoes that light up? It's awesome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ_IdA5cbvk
Omg this is the cutest thing ever I love it! What an awesome granddaughter and a great bonding moment between them :) Edit: a word
Is that Portugese?
Thank you. As a colorblind person I appreciate you actually saying what color it was. For the record that shade of green just looks gray to me.
The club can’t even handle grandma right now. 
My Nana asked for - and got - a tattoo for her 87th birthday.  A little ladybug on her forearm.  She absolutely lived life to the fullest! 
Hope things get better soon, bud.  Hugs. 
My dad wanted a pair of adult sized light up shoes.  BADLY.  He passed before I ever found him a pair though.  This video warms my heart so much because I know he would have reacted just like this.
This entire time I've been on reddit, I've avoided r/eyebleach because I thought it'd be full of gross things, as in, you would need bleach *after* seeing that subreddit. I had **NO** idea that it was full of cute shit. Consider me learned and subscribed. 
Yes, brazilian portuguese.
Thank you!! I sincerely thought i was going crazy. I'm glad other CB people have had issues just so I know I'm not alone.   I did the CB test (the super long one on the internet) that gives you the type. Pinks and greys are as hard as purple and brown. I have almost no ability to tell light shades apart of any color.
Ahhh damn. Thats tough. I'm sorry. At least your thought was there. 
Wear a pair in honor of him? Light up sneakers are dope!
That explains the tropical surroundings 🌴
Yes Brazilian Portuguese and forever young.
Ha jokes on you. Im mexican and i wanna die
Now he needs to start dad jokes. It's good he knows sign language, it’s pretty handy.
Did he get a friggin' hug!? I need to know.
Made me cry too.
His facial expression when he realizes what is happening is one of the best things I've ever seen. Raw human emotion can be so visceral at times and it's beautiful
As a new dad myself... his deafness will be a blessing when the baby is crying in the middle of the night! Nice vid. X
Honest question- how do deaf parents hear their baby cry in the middle of the night?
So excuse me if this sounds insensitive, but I feel like deaf folks in these sorts of videos just emote way better than those with hearing. Perhaps it’s the fact that they use their bodies to express themselves everyday, but I typically find it much more enjoyable to watch these Gifs when there really isn’t supposed to be sound. The understanding of the gears turning in their heads and hearts are much easier to read for me. 
/r/happycryingdads 
He’s going to be one exceptional father with that type of reaction
Just straight to the tears.
The feels hit me way too hard :(
Omg you hug that sweet man right now

Sign out now
Son of a bitch, that was fast
I am calling the cops
Pretty sure that’s why they stopped filming. Future Mum and Dad cuddles were being had. 
I'm not crying. Just got something in my eyes.
"Is the sign for pregnant really ""expanding"" your belly? If so, that's damn cute!"
I love how he goes digging through the bag for the last thing after he realises.
You peed on this!?
I find it amazing that among only a few other things, a pregnancy announcement can elicit any emotion ranging from pure bliss to complete despair, depending only on context.
"""I was up 4 times last night!""  ""Really? I didn't hear anything."""
I don't mean to be ignorant, but I'm curious now... How would two deaf parents know their baby was crying at night? Are there baby monitors that vibrate or light up or something?
There are baby monitors that flash/vibrate when the baby is crying :) 
Deaf mom here.  I co-slept with my kids, and they just quickly learned to kick their legs to wake me.
I didn’t think that was insensitive at all. It was very insightful.
I know a lot of deaf people and this is actually really true, since facial expressions are so important for understanding sign language, they really know how to show their emotions.
facial expressions are an immensely important part of signing. it is essentially the primary way of conveying tone and inflection. 
Baby will be a handful  He's a handsome guy  He doesnt need words to express himself
If he is handcuffed he will be forced to remain silent
“Cuddles”
Was it happiness?
It is! My niece is deaf so my sister and brother-in-law are fluent in asl. When I shared the news of my pregnancy, I told them in sign. 
"""Wait, *is the baby in here??*"""
This is my child’s father, and he can hear.
I believe they have monitors that have a pad for your bed so it vibrates.
Excellent to know, thank you!
I think almost all do nowadays.  Every one we've had vibrates, which is awesome because I can put it under my pillow on vibrate to wake me and let my wife sleep.
Gotta cover all your bases on Reddit or someone will likely take issue with some aspect.
*glares intensely at everyone else*  This is a nice moment nobody ruin it 
Words can't express how happy he is.
Only have 9 months to completely ignore birth control!
Quite possibly.
yeah i've been fluent in asl since I was a 15/m/NJ
"*""oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy!!!""*"
Am father. Yes. 
"Both of my mom's parents were deaf, which was obviously before this technology was invented. I'll ask how her parents dealt with it.  Edit: response! They used voice activated sensors, that flashs a light in the room when a baby cried. I'm afraid I have no idea what parents used before the early 70's.  Edit 2: Before the 60's, apparently it was much more common for deaf people to live with relatives, so it wasn't as much of a problem.  Also, responding to the comment about me using the word ""were"", I didn't mean that. For one, my grandpa is still alive, and two, because my grandma is no longer alive, I guess she is still technically deaf too."
Beyond that, many deaf friendly house modifications exist, such as ones that make yo ur lights flash when your doorbell is rung. 
> I can put it under my pillow on vibrate to wake me  This guy can dad.  > and let my wife sleep.  Also, this guy can husband. Keep up the good work.
Fucking baseball idioms.
I love all of you! You've made my night
This will probably show what kinda sex Ed I had as a kid but if someone’s pregnant and they get cream pied can a second baby form?
Thank you for the laugh. 
Am father. That was my wife. Each time one of our kids would make a sound, I'd wake up with my heart beating so fucking fast that it would take me **at least** an hour before I could possibly fall back asleep.  My wife would wake up after 5 minutes of near-death kid screaming, if I was lucky.
You'd be surprised. I can sleep through my kids crying. My wife can't - which is nice. If I don't hear them, my wife will. She'll either take care of them or wake me up to do it.   However, my oldest was born 4 months early and came home with a heart monitor. Every time that thing went off in the middle of the night, I was out of bed, across the room, at her crib before my feet had a chance to hit the floor. I was like The Flash. 
It's possible, but it's unusual. Usually, women only have one egg in the womb at a time, and the body stops the egg cycle while she's pregnant. So when the egg is fertilized, there's (usually) no other egg to be fertilized when they have sex again.  In uncommon occasions, there'll be two or more eggs at a time. When this happens, usually all eggs present will be fertilized at the same time (by different sperm cells, that's how you get fraternal twins, the ones that don't look the same), but if one or more don't, they can be fertilized the next time around and so on. It's even possible for twin babies to have different fathers.   Also, to other people: Don't downvote someone asking an honest question. At the time I commented, the question was at -1.
the baby gets pregnant
I appreciate your response it was insightful so I thank you :)
It is possible for two fertilized eggs to merge into one, the result is a human chimera, who carries different genomes in different parts of the body.  [There are about 100 known cases, all discovered by coincidence](http://www.medicaldaily.com/human-chimera-paternity-test-reveals-child-fathered-long-lost-vanished-twin-absorbed-359050).  Normally, the two embryos would be from the same father.  [However, twins from different fathers are sometimes born- the twins would be half siblings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfecundation)  It is probably possible for the two embryos to merge, creating a human with two fathers.  There may be numerous people like this walking around, no one would notice, unless they did an unusually detailed DNA test.
Big shoutout to second chances and what they can do 
I tell you, I’m always hearing nice things about Waste Management. They’re pretty good for a trash company. 
I'm assuming WM is not for Wal-Mart  Edit: glad the guy is trying, faithful, and finding success in that.
Sounds like Otis is good. If the guy was living under a bridge sounds like God is a dick. 
nice to read something positive for a change
I feel that I had a very privileged upbringing, but for a couple years I worked in a factory kitchen with people who never had the opportunity to go to college, some not even high school. But I am still amazed by the grit and determination I saw in that place. Even after 14-hour shifts, these people worked the hardest I've ever seen in my young adult life and still managed to wear a smile. Truly humbled by that job  Edit: by factory kitchen, I just mean a large industrial kitchen that makes fresh food in bulk everyday for our local grocery chain. In one sense we were like chefs, but in a much realer sense, were hauling hundreds of pounds of real ingredients to large machinery to get cooked or mixed or chopped up, so I look at it as more of a general blue-collar thing
Props to the kid for busting his arse. Second chances only work if both sides have motivation. 
**God** is good?? Seems more like Otis gave him a chance and the kid did all the work on his own. God had nothing to do with it. 
"> God is good!!!!!  ""Otis Owill Williams is good"" - God, probably"
This for sure.   I was a store manager at a retail store, had a kid come in one day looking for a job. Talked to him for a while and he was an ex drug addict. Got into it from a bad situation when he was like 13, and at that point was 1 month clean and had never had more than that under his belt.   I understood him and gave him a shot and neither of us work there anymore but I talked to him recently and he celebrated 3 years clean last month, is buying a house, has a car and a good job.   People will surprise you sometimes when you look past their past and give them that opportunity. 
They really step up in garbage time...
Depends where and who you're working for. Alot of locations are hostile towards their union employees, lie about PTO and benefits, exploit people from low income housing in temp positions for years that should be WM employees and in my 3 years there 6 people had been killed on the job at different facilities, either crushed inside machines or had bales of garbage fall on them. Since they pay lower wages to them temp workers the deceased persons lifetime earnings are assumed to be low and what they pay out the family of the deceased is cheaper. FUN.  Edit: yes Garbage collection is one of the most dangerous jobs, however I'm citing my experience in the recycling centers where people didn't have to die if not for incompetent safety practices. Drivers and landfill make up the largest amount of fatalities.
I think it's Waste Management
Not going to harp on other's beliefs, but this is a huge reason why I can't do religion. This man and Otis did the good thing. Why give god that credit?
why god have him homeless with no clothes? lmfao🤔
I was on a long solo train ride (Cochrane -> Moose Factory), and started playing cards with a guy, then gave him a truck ride home (a few hours).  He was a die hard alcoholic who said he only drank because he was bored but he has been in and out of jail, lost his family and he had not had a job in 2 years.  Seemed really not happy about his situation.  I took a chance on him and that was about 7 years ago. He still doesn't drink and has been promoted a bunch of times.  
Alcoholic. I was in the midst of a relapse when I got my current job, no experience, no anything other than some half finished degree, guy took me in, gave me a job and helped me put my school shit back on track. I still have a rough time with drinking, but I finished the degree thanks to his help and now I actually have some credentials and experience to work with. 
Waste management jobs are often near the top of lists of the most dangerous jobs to have. More dangerous than being a construction worker or police officer. 
You are correct.   
If Otis wants to attribute his own actions to his God and his faith I'm not sure who you or anyone else is to say where credit should be going.  It could very well be the case that Otis feels that the presence of God in his life is what compelled him to help this man.
When he came to me, I had people tell me I shouldn’t and to be careful, but I saw a good kid who has a shitty hand dealt and made bad choices.  But more importantly; I saw someone who WANTED to change their life, who wanted that chance to be better. And I’ve noticed that those people who want that, have a better drive sometimes because they have something that they don’t ever want to go back to and it always keeps them moving forward and progressing  
Apart from a few years abroad, I lived for 30 years in a medium sized city. I can't recall any firefighter or police deaths, but I do recall at least 3 occurrences of the municipal trash collection location shutting down because someone didn't clock out on time or missed a break. Each time they would find them, hours or a day later, dead and under several tons of trash.
I'm agnostic atheist but I do agree with your sentiment. Who gives a shit what others are doing & crediting as long as it's got a positive outcome.
God never said or did anything.
Some of us really want to be better people, but drinking just...does something to us. 
Hey man, just be the best you possible. If you want to change than there’s a way. There will always be someone out there to help you. Whether it’s a friend or family, a future employer, or hell a random person on the internet.   There’s always the opportunity. If it’s something You decide to change, I believe in you friend. 
Go celebrate by making a bunch of irresponsible and unsustainable purchases 
And right before Christmas! Not bad
I have those EXACT same cards I'm trying to get paid off. Good job! Can't wait until I can make a post like this!!!!  Car has 10mo left u til it's paid off! 
Man money doesn't necessarily buy happiness but clearing your debt removes so much stress and mental baggage. Really happy for you.
Proud of you, boo
Congratulations! And right before xmas! Very nice! I aspire to get here one day :)
This is a goal of mine for the next two years. Good for you, OP!!! 
Why are people recommending cutting up credit cards or not using them ever?  I don’t have debt or balance on my cards, but I make sure to put as many purchases on my credit cards to get points/cash back.
Must be nice!! I could pay off my credit cards and STILL be in debt...student loans bane of my existence!
Treat yo self 
Plot twist:   He's going Christmas shopping now. ;)
Your can do it! I believe in you! 
Pay off one with the other two!
>  money doesn't necessarily buy happiness but clearing your debt removes so much stress and mental baggage  This should be printed on cards and given to everyone
"**""Warning: (credit card) Debt causes stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder.""**"
Way ahead of you. I closed the accounts before paying them off completely to avoid temptation. 
Same, but I think the majority of people do not have self control. And so they'll use it on impulse purchases or things they can't afford.  Credit cards, if used responsibly, are incredibly powerful and provide huge benefits.
>$1000 debt  Oh my sweet summer child.
It’s the best day of the year!
Haha! Nope. Already done Christmas shopping! 
r/unexpectedpawnee
Then you are truly an American unicorn
Lol I kinda think it’s both. Commenter above you was making a joke but it can make sense to consolidate debt onto one card (ideally one with an introductory 0% rate!)
Good tip! I still have my student loans to knock out, so I still have my oldest account open. 
I just finished yesterday myself.  Have to spend the weekend wrapping stuff I forgot to order gift wrapped.
So.....not actually debt free then?
I love how your friend avoided the first hug to drop his stuff in the ground because he knew what was coming! 
For a second I though the bag he dropped was a fat dog. Especially with the way it rolled.    Edit: word. Not wearing my glasses and just noticed I put bad and not bag 🤣
All I can see is that nutsack at 0:18.  edit: my highest upvoted comment is now about me looking at a nutsack.
Stuff like this makes me so happy
That’s the kind of friendship I want! Glad you got to see each other again after so long
I love my friends, but I can't say I've ever been this excited to see them. I'm jealous
This has exactly the same energy as those dogs reunite with owner vids. 
This is fucking cute, but I can't be the only one who imagined him wailing on him when one of them pinned the other on the ground
Your choreography is fantastic!!!
Are they Australian? Because this is exactly how my Aussie friend greeted me at the airport. 
Why are you both dressed like Steve Irwin?
You look like you’re about to beat the shit out of each other at any moment. That’s friendship. 
This made me so happy!   I had a similar reaction to good news regarding my best friend a couple nights ago. The short of it is that we both found our way prescription painkillers in our early twenties. I’ve been clean for 4 years now and have tried to be there for him, but you can only lead a horse to water, right? So, he was picked up on heroin charges in August of last year, went to a 28-day program, and then right back home. I was so worried that because of his wife’s seemingly lack of concern, and where he lives, that I was basically grieving the loss of my buddy. Then, 2 nights ago I checked in on him and he was leaving a treatment facility after going to tell his story to the guys there! I fucking sat down on my kitchen floor and cried some happy tears and told him how I loved him and was so proud of him. Shit, I’m getting emotional about right now. But yeah, this is exactly how it felt. Awesome!
He’s freeballin’! 
Thats heartwarming. Im lucky I have two friends I could and have done this with.
it's like watching 2 golden retrievers after they have not seen each other in 7 minutes 
It’s so much fun man. I have 2 friends in my life who are like that. I love pretty far away from them now so these greetings happen like once a year. We pick up conversations like we were never apart. True friendship never dies from distance :)  Edit: I didn’t want to sound like I was bragging and now I feel bad. I guess I just never really thought about our friendship and how much I appreciate it till now. 
"It's not about caring. Tons of people might care about other people like those two do.   It's about trust. Imagine exposing that much emotion in front of dozens of strangers / people you know. And imagine it going bad.   But those two trust each other enough and know it doesn't matter what other people think. They know the other will show emotions in return. It's a bit ""us vs the world"" thinking. As long as they have & trust each other they have one other person to goof around with.   Trust is about letting go and knowing that you'll always be caught, which enables such reactions.  "
Ty for confirming it was...stuff...I thought he chucked his dog on the ground, lol, was like wtf, at first.
Hahahaha, I had to rewind it like 5 times to make sure it wasn't a dog he either dropped or kicked away in his excitement.
Lmfao I thought you were joking
[For reference lmao](https://i.imgur.com/WKTUBLa.png)
How’d you notice that tho >< baha
The girl laughing in the background stops laughing when she sees it. Then count unused to laugh when he’s finally on the ground again.  
Fuck man. I fucking love happy people. I have no idea who these bastards are but I'll be smiling about that sheer joy for a while until I encounter the next happy people! 
Same, got [flashbacks from Scrubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuHRtjbcvkc)
"People express emotions in different ways. I'm guessing you're probably the type of person who wouldn't react this way to *anything,* as am I, even though I will be extremely excited about things - it's just more of an internal thing for me rather than externally expressed. It doesn't mean we think any less of our friends, it just means we don't express it in that way.  For example, I am closer to my siblings than most people I know, yet we're chill about it. When I see these ""brother comes home from the military to surprise his sister"" videos on Youtube and she's screaming and jumps on him for a hug bawling her eyes out into his shoulder, I know my sister wouldn't react like that, but I have no doubt she would be just as happy to see me.  Another example: These Youtube videos of pregnancy announcements, where the soon-to-be grandparents flip out and scream jumping up and down and wailing, etc. Again, my parents are just as happy, but we simply don't express emotions in the same way. Instead, it is tearing up and hugs. A quiet moment.  Another example: If I were to win the Powerball, my reaction would be muttering ""holy shit"" to myself, and quietly staring at the ticket with my jaw dropped, after confirming the numbers several times. That would be my shock and awe at the situation. Others might scream and bounce around the room for 10 minutes.   None of these scenarios is superior to the others, nor do they mean that people in Situation A love each other more than people in Situation B. That is, the two guys in this video may in fact be no more excited to see each other than you are when you see someone you care about after a long time, but they just express their excitement differently from how you do.  Lastly, keep in mind that overly-excited and funny videos like this are the ones that get shared on social media, because they're more interesting to watch rather than a quiet but joyful reunion, it doesn't mean they are the ""ideal"" reunion."
Just bros doing bro things 
Yeah I was expecting the one guy to laugh hysterically while punching his friend who was going to gleefully accept the brutal beat down. 
It's like wholesome wrestling!
Yeah shagga this is aussie as fuck
That's how people dress at music festivals, at least here in Aus. 
Or maybe like 8 minutes!
I kept replaying because I was convinced it was a dog. I’m still not convinced it wasn’t 
How are multiple people thinking this? It's clearly a bag!
I hoped he was joking
Cool, thanks!
The hero we didn't need this morning
He has a nutsack fetish. Check out his post history.
R/boneappletea
Right?? Seeing people happy is the greatest thing!! 
I don't think I've ever showed this much emotion in my whole life combined...
Legionnaire hat, tradie boots and stubbies shorts. Couldn't be any more aussie if they tried 
I love how different countries have a festival uniform. In the UK it’s Hunter boots and sundresses, in the US it’s flower crowns and bikini tops, and apparently in Australia it’s just Steve Irwin 
Who is that stranger?  OMFG it’s you!  I love you!
If it was a dog, it was a decidely round and strappy boy. 
I... I thought that was a dog too...
/r/SackSlip
Very cool!
We Saved the caps for the evening . This was midday. 
The girls basically just wear underwear and glitter though
"""It's been, what? Seven, eight minutes?""  *""Oh god, at least! How are your testicles doing!?""*  ""You tell me!""  *sniff*     "

That poor boy. I wish him all the best but he's got a long road ahead of him, he'll feel defeated and he'll no doubt experience a lot of heartbreak. But hopefully, one day he will be able to turn it around and be happy. It's hard being a Lakers fan.
Good for him.     I lost my dad to cancer, but he lived 5 extra years because he exercised like a machine.  
Good for him! But no way he’s at 0% BF, don’t you need 3% to survive/function?
Go get'em Jared!! U got this
This might be a dumb question (I have little knowledge of sports medicine besides my own lifting experience)... but wouldn't it make more sense for him to bulk up a bit via food before hitting the gym? In other words, put some extra lbs on, raise his body fat percentage, and then hit the weights?  I'm worried he's going to snap!  Either way, best of luck to this guy!
FIRST AND FOREMOST, THIS NOT ME! I thought it was an obvious screen cap. It’s just something I saw on Facebook and knew it belonged here. Turn all support and attention to Jared and his trainer at Body Alive gym.  For those wondering this gym is [Body Alive](https://m.facebook.com/BodyAliveFitnessCenter/posts/1854723611213578) based out of Utica, New York. I saw it on Facebook as a new post and decided Reddit needed to see it!  His Gram: Wellsy351  Edit: Could we make him  Reddit GetMotivated gear or something?? I think it would be cool to support him with more than words...  Edit: it IS ‘Jared’, not ‘Jarod’ and no, its not 0% body fat, Bob got a little carried away in his post and yes I was cleared by doctors to begin lifting. 
Forget his backstory; anyone who would laugh at a dude that scrawny is an asshole.  Best of luck.  Keep us posted!
Sometimes it's a shame you can't upvote something more than once.
This was essentially me in high school. I graduated at 5'8 and weighed like 86 pounds. I didn't have cancer, just a shitty mother who refused to accept food stamps because it offended her pride.   My growth was stunted for sure, but I've spent a lot of time in the gym since I was 18 and am now a healthy weight. 
The really hard part of cancer is a syndrome called cachexia. It's that wasting syndrome and is responsible for most of the cancer deaths.   I had stg4 cancer too (head and neck) and it fucked me over pretty good, though not as bad as this kid. He needs to get a grip on the weight though. I went from 360 to 155 from my battle and it was *tough* to get my body to stop losing and hold steady. You can do it but it's a tough road.   OP if you are the trainer please spend some time reading about cancer syndrome and how to battle it. Crazily enough the best way to stop the weight/muscle loss is not by eating but by working out. This guy is doing the right thing and is probably saving his life by being in the gym.
0% body fat? All aboard to shredded city. 
Lmao as a lakers fan this is hilarious, but you made me look real hard to find some lakers gear that i cant find. Assuming you are talking about the shorts
I wasn’t allowed to use my arms for 7 months when I was 19.  When you’re in that situation you’ll do anything to gain it back
Jesus Christ. I was tearing up reading that then got to the end. Thanks
>It's hard being a Lakers fan.  Is it really? i mean historically it's been the easiest thing out there hasn't it? 
Pfft he started at 0% so he's got a headstart on my fat ass /s  In all seriousness this is awesome. People who fight cancer seem to just generally be mentally tougher and more game than those who haven't gone through such hardship. He's fighting a brutal disease so lifting some weight will be nothing to him, mentally.
Yes. He would be dead right now if he was at 0% body fat.   It's not possible to have 0% BF and be alive at the same time. Your body will cease to function.    -----  Editing in my response to a few people for the curious:   Apart from the visible fat you see on your body, fat is also stored in small amounts in your bone marrow, organs and muscles. Fat plays many roles in the body, including regulating body temperature, cushioning and insulating organs and tissues, protecting nerve tissue, providing metabolic fuel for the production of energy, and more.  The medical complications of a very low body fat involve almost every body function and include the cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, skeletal, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems with the possibility to develop conditions such as heart damage, gastrointestinal problems, shrinkage of internal organs, immune system abnormalities, disorders of the reproductive system, loss of muscle tissue, damage to the nervous system, abnormal growths, and even death.   If your body fat level reached literal zero, your organs would rupture at even a light bump, your body would begin cannibalizing your muscle mass and your organ mass, and your organs would soon fail due to uninsulated temperature swings, among other things.   In fact, if you want to be even more specific, the cell membrane of a cell is composed of lipids (fat basically). Without this, your body will quickly experience mass cell death.   Men need around 3% body fat, women need around 13%.   No one can reach literal 0% body fat and survive.   No one can safely reach near 0% body fat and expect to survive long. It might be possible to get close to 1% or a bit less without dying if you only maintained that state for a very brief period of time and were extremely careful, but the risk of death would be large, and the damage you would do to your body would be substantial. 
They spelled his name as Jarod the first time... this really ticks me off
My dietitian girlfriend was more of a help to this question; “It’s probably best he does both (at extremely light weights). As long as he is eating healthy and building fat reserves and muscle, it’s fine for him to be doing this. It’s also building great habits for him moving forward in life; *for what you do during your comeback often carries on for the rest of your life.”*  Brb gonna propose to this woman. Damn.   Edit: [Y’all thought I was kidding. ](https://imgur.com/a/0klMG) 
Why don't you link it so we can show some support and encouragement on there
Anyone laughing at anyone trying to better themselves is an asshole.
this. No one gets *that* scrawny without some kind of horrible situation, be it extreme sickness, mental health (i.e. bulimia or anorexia), or malnouirishment. None of which are laugh worthy.
Sweet Jesus. I was like 5’3” in high school, weighed like 100lbs, and was considered rail thin by most people. 5’8 and 86 lbs I can’t even imagine.   Takes a lot of effort to eat enough to put on a healthy weight. I know your struggle. 
I’m like 99% sure 0% body fat = death tho? Maybe he has like 1-3%?
It was actually the chain smoking.
It's 3 sentences long. Did you pre-cry or something?
I don't want to come off as a quarrelsome idiot, because I know your point was made to give respect to people who are or have been fighting this terrible disease.  But it does really render some people in terrible states both physically and mentally, and that's understandable and we should be there for them when we can.  
My guess is that his BF is below the threshold of the the gym’s (likely crude) measurement device. 
My grandfather is 0% body fat, but he's been dead for years so yeah I guess you're right. 
This may be a dumb question but I tried to Google and all I got was a body builder who died with almost 0% bf, but wouldn't it be different because he doesn't have a massive amount of muscle on his body? Like comparatively? 
And stuff like that is why you can't have zero percent body fat and still be alive. 
As a Jared IRL you would be surprised how challenging my name is to people. I get some insane spellings at Starbucks. I used to be able to say like the subway guy, and then like the only famous person with my name had to go be a fucking pedophile so now I just say like the diamond store.
If you do, I hope it (the marriage) carries on for the rest of your lives :)
"Do it, and please report back.  I had a ""realize I was going to marry her"" moment with my now wife 12 years ago. Best decision I've ever made."
This post is a non stop roller coaster ride
[The post](https://www.facebook.com/BodyAliveFitnessCenter/posts/1854723611213578)
What about a midget on stilts?
"No worries, I'm an open book. Mid-40's, active but obese, non-smoker. Started getting tired more than usual. I just felt a little...off. Figured it was allergies or something. Then I had a couple of night sweats and I figured it was my thyroid or something. Then I dropped a little weight. It was only 10 pounds or so (I was over 350 so that's not a bunch for me) and that got me considering what was going on. One Sunday morning I was shaving and felt a lump in my neck. It was directly under my earlobe, behind the curve of my mandible. In a flash it all made sense and I said to myself ""Oh shit, this is cancer."" It was, and it had already spread into my lymphatic system.  The primary cancer location was my tonsil. Since I never smoked it was very likely caused by exposure to the HPV virus in my teens. I'd had oral sex with a girl and exposed my throat. As my doctor explained it the virus tends to lay dormant and wait for the immune system to slow down when you hit your 40's then it wakes up and causes chaos.  That's probably all you really want to know. The treatment part...well that's pretty bad stuff. I'll talk about that if anyone is interested but it's not very fun reading.  The takeaway? Get your kids the gardisil shots. Boy, girl, doesn't matter. Protect them. You don't want them to be me. Trust me on that."
*holy shit*
can someone explain this joke to the less sports minded people
*sigh* every thread...
#CRYING INTENSIFIES 
Agreed. My mom died of cancer a few years back and the language with which people describe the progression or remission of the disease bothered me the whole time she was sick. “Fighting” and “warrior” and “winning” and “losing” as if it was an MMA bout, or staying alive or dying was somehow a commentary or litmus test of ones mental toughness or character. I get if this kind of mentality helps some stick with healthy regimens that increase their chance at survival, but realistically so much of getting cancer and your eventual outcome is chance. It just bothered me to think my mom’s lack of “fighting like a warrior” somehow reflected on her, as she was one of the kindest, highest character, grittiest people i ever knew.
You don't seem quarrelsome. It's a valid point. Some people are devastated in so many ways by this truly diabolical disease.   My apologies to those who feel I'm trivializing cancer in any way.
I would say thats a bingo. 
It’s because your cells, and basically everything in you, need fat to work and grow. Not having any fats would literally make you unable to function in any capacity, down to the cell
It’s a percentage, so 3% bf on a bodybuilder is more than 3% on this guy, but it’s the same relative to their own body composition.
I think we will be. I am looking at rings, photo in edit

Haha she rolls her eyes at Reddit. Especially when I made national news as the [sobbing brother](https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/brother-sobs-watching-sisters-wedding-dance-dad/story?id=49929105) 
Yeah, if that midget laughs at this kid, he's an asshole. 
r/jesuschristreddit
Thank yous to everyone.  This is going so much better than the post about the guy who gave temporary tattoos to children with chronic diseases and I was like, I think we can just call them tattoos.
Lung cancer was the what the kid in the image has been fighting. Chain smoking is often tied to being really stressed. Being a Lakers fan is very stressful.
As a non sports fan I can tell you that chain smoking is bad.
As of course is tradition.
For what it’s worth... Even warriors lose battles. It doesn’t mean your mom is any less strong than people who survive cancer. Sometimes the cancer is just too horrible. And sometimes people have been fighting for just too long. None of that makes your mom any less of a fighter though. I understand what you mean, I just want you to know that in the culture I grew up in (military culture), dying doesn’t make you not a warrior. I’ve had family members die of cancer within 6 months of their diagnosis, and I’ve had a family member survive their cancer and stay in remission for 20+ years now. Both of the 6 month diagnosis (grandparents) were lung cancer and my cousin who is still cancer-free had leukemia. They’re all warriors to me, no matter the outcome, because that shit is always a battle.   I’m terribly sorry for your loss. I wish I could give you a hug. I’m sorry. 
I completely empathize and agree with you. I remember even American Cancer Society put a commercial on TV a year or so ago that ended with something like, “Courage: just one of the reasons more people are living with cancer than dying with it.” And while I understand the intent, it made me feel sick because my mom had been beyond optimistic before she passed and constantly tried to “be strong,” and yet none of that changed the fact that her diagnosis was terminal. No amount of courage could save her.  She beamed when people called her a warrior, a term she found hope in so I went along with it. It also made me start looking at strength differently. Not physical strength or even tenacity, but rather a subjective and changing state of doing the best we can in whatever moment. On some days, the best my mom could do was be fed thick liquids by hand or walk with two people assisting to the car. That was no less strong in my eyes than when she was hiking mountains, playing softball, or standing unbreakable in spirit.  Also, I’m really sorry for your loss.
Are you and /u/vipsilix Canadian? I, for one, found myself entirely unprepared for such a polite and wholesome interaction. Is Reddit turning nice?
Lol, Hans? Is that you?

I really like Hill and what he creates/stars in but something seems so forlorn about him.
Credit to Jonah Hill for staying active and [losing nearly 80 lbs. (36 kg)](https://i.imgur.com/7mLmmmL.png)
I didn't know he was doing jiu jitsu, go Jonah!  He's one of the celebs I randomly see around NYC more than any other (it's actually kinda weird), and I can confirm, he's pretty fit and foxy these days. Happy he found his passion.
fuck the guys who were trained in BJJ using it on some randos at school 
if i was a multi million dollar celeb i'd be doing all sorts of random stuff too with my personal trainer while my personal chef makes me a perfectly healthy masterpiece.
The real motivation here is that he had the balls to bleach his hair at 35.  
He's one of the few actors that has gone from the silly fat boy that everyone made fun of to a really great serious actor. I really liked him in maniac. 
Thats cool, you ever try DMT?
Sucking at something is the first step to being kinda good at something.
Okay so a couple of what the fucks:  How long has Jonah Hill been 35?  How long has Jonah Hill been blonde?
That's incredible and not only that but he looks good. For a while there he was skinny but didn't look normal—to the point I selfishly wanted him to gain the weight back, but this picture, I don't miss the old Jonah at all. Thanks for sharing.
"I picked up a violin for the first time in my 40s. Hoo boy, that's a way to do worse than you ever have in anything in your life. Kept it up for a while, eventually got to be the last second violin in a community orchestra. Still sucked worse than anything. Gave it up after getting ""frozen shoulder"" a second time (other shoulder).  Still fiddle some dance tunes every once in a while.  Bottom line, it's nice that everything else I do isn't as bad as something I once did and eventually got to be not horrible in."
Just your typical high school jui jitzu party where ya get beat up. 
Dude went super saiyan.
He’s getting buff. He’s Jonah Mountain now
He did it once before and gained it back. My hope is the discipline gained will help him live a healthy lifestyle. And like Arnie said before him: smoking weed doesn't consume calories.
You know he’s gonna invite Jonah to the show after this post
Jamie, pull up that video of the silverback gorilla...    Yeah now go a little forward...more...no back up...there    That thing will eat your face.
Just reading this comment makes me hungry for elk meat.
Hey that's really cool and all, but have you ever tried DMT?
"When he got skinny instead of people being happy for him everyone started saying ""He's not funny anymore now that he's not fat"". There's compilations on youtube of interviewers (some even huge ones) saying stuff like that to his face it's pretty messed up."
His Icelandic character from Manic I would put in the top 10 best in all of film history. 
I think he’s been that way since his brother died  last year or the year prior :(  ETA: his brother essentially [passed away](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiaiYeO3vDfAhVvIjQIHQCJDq8QzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeople.com%2Fmusic%2Fjordan-feldstein-cause-of-death%2F&psig=AOvVaw29T1eswCCR9RMOsrepil9B&ust=1547674278511903)  due to an unhealthy lifestyle. I wonder if that’s been Jonah’s motivation to get fit...
A lot of people used to make fun of him for being the fat/ugly comedic relief in movies, especially when he was cast next to a guy who was more good looking. I imagine it must have taken a toll on his self-esteem.  They would do this to his face when he went on talk shows or was interviewed.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZKiRRYNn1s (the Brad Pitt one is a joke that both were in on)  e:  >Fleury, the so-called Miss Météo on the popular Grand Journal show on Canal Plus, said sorry to Hill after she had poked fun at him during last Friday’s show.  >She had mocked the actor for being sodomised by a three-metre tall demon in one of his films and then suggested her fantasy would be for him to invite his friends Leonardo di Caprio and Brad Pitt round to their hotel room, but then for him to leave.  >The actor decided to cancel all his publicity interviews following the exchange on live TV.  https://www.thelocal.fr/20160913/french-weather-girl-says-sorry-after-ridiculing-jonah-hill
He genuinely seems lost. Even in his older movies he was a lot like jack black, but without the joy that made jack so endearing. I feel like there’s a lot more to hill then meets the eye.
I feel like he wants to be respected in the same regard most high-caliber actors are (And he deserves it, imo, I think he's great) but he's still the butt of the joke in the circles he's in too frequently.   He's at the bottom of the top.
He didn't actually lose weight between those two pictures. It's the airpods that makes him look more slim.
There is NO WAY IN HELL that that dude only lost 80 lbs.  edit:  I know muscle is more dense than fat. That being said, I just can not see him weighing more than 180 lbs in that picture, and I just can not see him weighing 260 lbs or less in [this one](https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/jonah-hill-split.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1). Hence my conclusion that he lost more than 80lbs from his heaviest.   Bottom line is though, he lost a ton of weight, for which I congratulate him.
There's a line in that movie *Funny People* where he makes fun of Seth Rogen's character for losing weight and says people liked him better when he was fat.  Good on Hill for losing the weight, but the selfish part of me misses the fat *Superbad* Hill.
I take the boy I nanny for to this jiu jitsu place! I didn’t even realize Jonah was in NYC, but now all I want is to casually run into him while I’m there lol. 
Teenagers man, teenagers. 
It's weird to imagine in high school a group of bullies would be trained in Martial arts. When I was in highschool bullies where more akin to Cartman than The Karate Kid.
I had an older brother who learned mma growing up. He trained  me in how to get my ass kicked 
Money isn't going to immediately eliminate all your insecurities.
It’s probably for a role but who cares?
> Maniac  h y p e  Full on serious, one of my favorite shows of all time.  And I'm old.  To anyone who hasn't seen it:  This show will weird you out at first, but give it a chance-- if you have a soft spot for oddball and emotionally intense fiction with a heart of gold, you'll be in love by the end.  There is some violent shit but it's almost all virtual (and quite well done).  Great acting, writing, sets, camera work, music, suspense, humor, everything.  Surreal and dystopian, yet warm and human.  Make time for it.
Jamie, look up Chimpanzee Muscles... geez look at that thing
I was thinking more ‘guy fieri’ 
He can probably feel his rematch coming.
He gains and loses weight for movies all the time. It's not good for him but he's good at managing weight. Look at how much weight he gained for War Dogs, and then he lost it all after the film.  Edit: [Here's a before and after pic](http://www.que.es/archivos/201706/jonah_hill_n-672xXx80.jpg)
Bad bleached hair, baggy eyes leftover from being overweight and probably just stress, and this procure was taken after working out so he's sweaty. He could also use  a shave, that beard isn't working for him.  Edit: A lot of people are taking my comment personally and as an attack on him (or themselves). I'm not. I was just explaining to the guy above me all the little things adding together that made him somehow appear unhealthy.
"When some obese people do a round of weight loss, they do tend to look gaunt. The reason is low muscle mass.  To get to a traditionally healthy look, they need to do then do a protein heavy bulk to build muscle mass, and then do another cut.  Basically, for some people there is more work to do after the initial weight loss.  Also, I disagree that he looks less healthy here.  Heres some images comparing:  https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/pictures/jonah-hill-shows-off-weight-loss-before-and-after-pictures-w487217/  Sure, he doesn't look ""amazing"" or anything in the lower weight pictures. Thats just because he's just not a very attractive person (no hate, I'm an ugly sod too, even uglier than Jonah Hill). But he definitely looks better in the after pictures. "
A 35 year old face looks older than a 25 year old face, yeah. 
Hey Jonah, great to have you. I used to play Quake for 12 hours a day. Jamie, pull that up
It's entirely possible 
That fucker will rip your dick off
It's entirely possible 
"Yeah cant imagine what its like for the whole world to tell you, ""yeah we like you but we mostly like how pathetic you seem to us and if that stops we wont like you anymore. Come be pathetic for us!"""
"There's one presser he's doing where a reporter asks him something like *""Are you still considered the fat guy when you go to a party and stuff? Are you still considered a fat guy in Hollywood?""*  There's several more reporters in the room and they all chuckle at the question-- and you can just see this look of disappointment ripple across his face as the reporter artlessly bumbles through his insensitive, moronic question.   As someone who lost a ton of weight and then went overboard with it-- *yeah*... some people struggle with ever seeing themselves as anything other than a fat person. "
https://youtu.be/MZKiRRYNn1s
I mean he’s the one who literally said “there’s nothing funny about an in shape guy” to Seth Rogen in funny people 
As good as that character was, I still hold the Owen that's associated with the mob and all that that arc entails as some of the best acting I've ever seen. 
I didn't hear about that. That'll do it though. Some lights get snuffed out and never get relit.
That was insanely poor taste. I guess they think because he is a comedic writer and actor he can just take any kind of criticism. These are people that don't really understand what it takes to be universally funny.
"He directed Danny Brown's [""Ain't It Funny"" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L4JnAuW00k) which is about constantly being ""on"" and being the funny guy while feeling empty inside. And also includes, amongst other things Danny being stabbed to death by a giant Xanax pill so yeah I'd tend to agree."
"To me, Jonah Hill seems to be the opposite of lost.  He just won GQ's ""Man of the Year"" and emerged as a style icon in 2018.  He wrote and directed his first film and it was a success.  He's seems to be physically healthy and at-peace mentally.  What makes you think ""he genuinely seems lost""?"
You've been promoted to King/Queen of Apple Marketing.  Congrats!

Consider his height. 80 lbs looks like a lot more on a 5'7 dude than a 6'3 dude
Have you seen him In accepted? That’s peek fat for sure. Super bad level fat seemed just right.   Edit:spelling 
"I dunno if he's here year round, but I think he used to live in Soho at least part-time, because that's where I always spotted him.  Once I was shopping at a store on Greene Street and he popped his head in the door to say hi to the salesgirl who was helping me. He was being all cute and flirty and claimed he couldn't come in because he had some kind of beverage in hand. So she literally walked away from me mid-conversation (she was about to help me into a dressing room) to go flirt with Jonah Hill and I'm standing there like.....""ok legit decision actually.""  And that was the day I realized Jonah was a mack."
He used to live in L.A. but then the Rapture happened during a party at James Franco's house and it got weird.
If I was a celebrity, I wouldn't be a cool celebrity. I like to think I'm a nice dude, but I leave parties early because I get tired of interacting with people pretty quickly. I'd gladly do charity events, but I'd hate to be stopped by fans.
Shitty adults are grown from shitty teenagers 
No, but projecting them onto somebody else will.
Guy Fieri biopic?
It's honestly stranger that Seth Rogen is only 36 because Seth looks like he's in his mid 40s at least

The POWER OF **FLAVORTOWN**
Except the guy he was playing in War Dogs wasn't fat in real life. I don't think he gained weight for that role. 
Jonah Hill has been very outspoken about how insecurity had enveloped his life at an early age and throughout most of his career so far, leading to weight gain, in turn leading to more insecurity. How even anonymous internet bullying got to him, etc. Yet, here he is on a post on /r/getmotivated and it took only a few comments before seeing one bashing his appearance. People are something else. 
It’s gonna be 3 hours of Gi vs No Gi 
I actually had a t1 line installed, they tore up the street and everything.
Jamie pull up the Jonah Hill picture
"I think that's a real issue in America in general. People get branded ""the fat guy/girl"" and that sort of becomes part of their identity. People don't want to be perceived as weak or insecure so they're afraid to lose the weight. Even when they lose weight they're labeled, ""that ex fat person"" and everybody just brings up how fat you used to be.   I grew up obese in a low income household with overweight parents. When I was 22 I dropped from 310lbs to 187lbs and once I hit that weight I just felt lost. I thought my life would suddenly feel so much better but people just started being less open to me and stopped inviting me to things as if I was suddenly too good for them. Suddenly I wasn't the cliche fat guy any more I guess. Over the next 8 years I slowly crept back up to 325lbs and about 6 months ago I decided to get back on track.  I'm at 250lbs and everything is going really good but I'm already starting to get hit with the ""oh you've lost so much weight tell me how to lose weight"" conversations. I'm still considered obese and I don't really want to be reminded of how fat I used to be. I know people are just trying to be nice but I just really don't want to talk about it. Its like a scarlet letter that never goes away."
Pretty sure this is what killed Chris Farley...  Imagine the outcry if Rebel Wilson lost a bunch of weight and everyone criticized her.
So... Self deprecating humor or worse someone else made him say it.   
Can confirm. When i used to work in SoHo, i saw him chatting it up with 2 ladies on the steps outside a cafe. I was going to say hey but i was on my way to get lunch and i was starving.
Yeah he seems like an introvert and I can’t imagine how draining it must be to be an introverted celebrity. 
Ok what the fuck
Grabs Ki lit torch.
You say that as though Hollywoods 'based on a real story' films care about the real story. Could literally be the director execs wanted a fat guy for the comedic effect
"I think it would be like 20 minutes of GI vs no GI and then Jonah would be like ""um (nose scratch while eyes looking up) I dont know a ton about that stuff, ive only been doing this two months...I mean its awesome I just dont know if I can hang in this conversation. I feel great though"" "
Look at the balls on that thing
> inaudible mumbles by jamie  i think i heard what he said  give that man a mic!
If you ever question if a friend is happy for you when something good happens to you they arent your friend. Sounds like you need a new crowd. Congrats on hittin it again!
Chris Farley was a drug addict and was a known for speedballing, and took horrible care of himself. IIRC, he suffered an overdose, but thehookers he was with just left him there. They could have called first responders. Possible that he could of been saved, but also possible that he'd eventually die young anyway.
Damn, TIL J.Hill does nothing but mack it to pretty ladies all over Soho! Maybe I'll try my luck next time.
jesus that thing will tear you to shreds
That he consumed to deal with depression and being a puppet or jester for the world 
I might do that myself! Have to make myself pretty first and hide my dick. 
That’s crazy man. Have you ever tried DMT?
Sometimes people just want some dopamine because they cannot find it in their natural lives.

She went from *giving* people coronary artery disease, to *treating* people with coronary artery disease.
Y'all sleeping on how she went from manager to housekeeper before getting into nursing. Sometimes you gotta fall back and grind a bit more before your real journey begins.
Sitting here doing Calculus homework after not sleeping all night because my son was teething. I'm going for an engineering degree and with my son its HARD. Sometimes I feel like giving up and I feel hopeless because I'm so tired all the time, but Faye is an inspiration! Thanks Faye!   EDIT: Thank you all for your kind words!! Its been a rough few days and your words are really motivating. 
This is the real story. This is the REAL SELF MADE
As a fellow RN, i hope the badges dont stop coming.
She’s an inspiration.  I’m trying to do the same.  Sometimes I get discouraged because my job is so demanding.  But I have been taking classes when I can and doing well in them,  I just keep going and eventually it will pay off.  I’m at the point where I’m choosing to transfer to a new university.  It’s like my world is finally opening up.  I’ve made progress in the last three years.
Well done Faye, i stand up
">community college  A quick side comment about community college. When I was in high school, kids including myself used to make fun of people who attended the local community college (we used to joke that it was ""advanced high school""). I ended up going to a 4-year university but failed out because I was lazy and irresponsible. Years later I decided to return to school and settle for an Associate's Degree and accepted my fate, and since I had terrible failing grades I had to start from community college. When I got there... wow: I had completely newfound appreciation for those students in community college -- I met some of the hardest working and headstrong individuals in my life. Some of them were single parents working double shifts and still doing classes while others were immigrants that barely spoke a lick of English yet I would find them every morning and every evening in the same location studying away. It gave me the drive to  go back to 4 year college and I eventually completed an MBA, and let me tell you... community college was an amazing, humbling, and eye-opening experience for me; not a single person I met in the other schools worked as hard as some of the folks I seen in community college. The short two years at community college completely changed and shaped who I was, and made me ashamed of my spoiled and arrogant past -- it made me become a better me to an extend I never thought was possible. Even when you hit the bottom of the barrel, just remember that someone is working harder than you to crawl out of a similar barrel, and that you just need a bit of persistence."
That's just amazing. When's the movie coming out?
>Then something tragic happened: Faye's father, three cousins, and family dog were killed in a house fire  Fuck that hit me hard, I can't imagine being in that position. Glad her mother got out alright. She's tougher than I am that's for sure.
She was creating future employment opportunities.  Talk about foresight.  
She went from an old white man to a middle aged black woman.
Those side quests sometimes get you really powerful weapons. 
Speaking as someone that has done fast food management, going to housekeeping does not sound like a fall back.
keep at it... it will pay off. I just finished my engineering degree (my second degree, first was Biology) I felt stuck and helpless going the medical field route so that is why I went back. I ended up getting married and having a daughter during the engineering degree. It was tough being a non traditional student, but I just landed my first engineering job (outside of internships) and it feels amazing and rewarding to see the work pay off.
Community college was the best of my college years. Yeah, people made fun of me for going, but I saved 10k+ for the same shit.
When you get down to it, aren’t KFC and the medical establishment just in on a revolving door scheme to keep people coming and going  /s
With a brief stint as a house too
I’m 41 and I work in tech as a sysadmin. Every customer service skill I have comes from the gas station I worked at after high school.
I wish the stigma was gone, a lot of us would be sitting in a lot less student debt if we did 2yrs community College followed by a transfer
What ü say?
How many tobacco executives own stock in companies that treat cancer? I’ll give you a hint, not zero. 
In California, I went to a cc named Diablo Valley College.  After friends and I transfered to the “big name UC’s” expecting the worst, every science class was nothing compared to DVC. The classes at cc for us were way harder and way more involved. Almost no multiple choice or fill ins. Pure problem solving. They train you to make the big name schools seem easy.  Kids that came from UC’s to DVC for science summer classes all thought it would be easy because “it’s just a cc.” All 4 of the 26ish kids dropped after failing the first test.
Amen...  I’m 7 years out and I’m still 61k deep.

r/murderedbywords  Edit: r/terminatedbywords
This dude has been in the zone for 4 decades. 4 decades NOTHING. BUT. NET.  Edit: well this comment blew up, for the unaware this is a bit from a Bill Burr special [here's a link to it](https://youtu.be/ldIwEG9xQ-M).
It gets me every time Arnold says and does something with this kind of wisdom. His passion for being the best version of yourself really shines through here.
I may not like all of his politics, but god damn is Arnold one wholesome dude.
"Well Arnie just answered ""Who is your Daddy and what does he do"" for that guy"
Very appropriate profile picture of him next to that awesome text.
I've refereed at both Special Olympics and Non Special O meets before. The athletes who compete in the special Olympics are far and away more fun to be around. They cheer for everyone, they're excited to be there even if they don't win, they hug and high five everyone regardless of team. We have much to learn about sportsmanship and being a good human from these people. 
rekt.
Absolutely demolished. I'd change my name and start a new life dedicated to pleasing the great Arnold. 
I’ll share my own little story. For years I’ve been wanting to pick up art as a hobby (specifically painting), I really enjoyed it in HS and have always wanted to do it again. My special needs brother also wanted to get into art and I figured one day we would get into it together and I told him this but kept putting it off.  Up until this point his art was basically a five years old art then about 5 months later he shows up from school with paintings that I could not do to save my life, meanwhile I have not painted a single stroke.
Now that is a well constructed put down, and to finish with ‘no one will ever remember you’.  Wow. A little slice of ego sapping genius to make sure that poor sap lay awake just thinking about it.  
"""They asked me to switch to Windows 8, but I said, I still love Vista baby!"""
I work with people with mental disabilities, one of which competes.  I strongly disagree with Arnold.  It's nice to be compassionate for the less fortunate, but these people are almost never smarter, more skilled, courageous, etc.   I care about my residents, but they are nature's mistakes, and if we didn't have a compulsion as a society to carry our weak with us, they would be dead.  You can be compassionate and still realize that these people are not the best representation of humanity in any reasonable metric. That's just factually inaccurate.  I think they all should get as good a life as we can reasonably give them, but we don't have to idolize them like Arnold does here.
"Only part that kind of irks me is when Arnold says they have more ""courage, compassion, brains, skill --- actually more of every positive human quality"" than the guy.  As much as I respect special needs people and acknowledge that they're just a little less able-bodied/able-minded it's certainly not true that just because he made one insensitive comment-  _-with a fair/genuine question btw_   He's all of a sudden stupider, less compassionate, weaker, and less skilled than these special needs athletes.  Sure I can see how compassion relates to this, but that's not the only positive human quality and Arnold is making all sorts of assumptions about this man that are completely unfounded...  ""you're a bit of a dick on the Internet one time? YOU MUST HAVE _ABSOLUTELY NO_ POSITIVE HUMAN QUALITIES. YOU _NEED_ TO _CHANGE_ OR _NOBODY WILL EVER REMEMBER YOU._"" A little bit intense of a reply, honestly...  Yeah what the guy said was quite rude and insensitive, and definitely uncalled for, but he _did_ have a fair point. And instead of answering this man's question arnold goes on a rant at him? I don't see how this makes anything better...  Tl;Dr Mans a bit of a dick, but Arnold way over shoots his reply and makes all sorts of assumptions about this dude"
his best moment was when a person commented on him posting positively about gay marriage being legalized in the US.  The fan said 'i will no longer support you or your movies'  Arnold replied 'hasta lavista, baby'
That is a very big man saying some very big words. 
Nice. 
"""no one will ever remember you."" I wonder what this person was thinking after being destroyed by Arnold himself."
Billy boy  
ABSOLUTELY REPREHENSIBELELEVA ANABSBSNAMAMSNFB
As a competitor all his life, Arnold respects effort and drive. Someone who mocks that is less than a man to him because it denies them a right to compete to be better. 
People thought it was a joke when he ran for governor, and when he won, but he actually did a decent job. He’s a good role model and a good leader. For the most part. 
Have you seen his reply to the woman who was laughed at at the gym?
That's what attracted his housekeeper to him.
This is what I came here to see
If the other guys responds, I wonder if Arnold will be back.
I volunteer with artists with disabilities and they are just such a fucking joy to be around. Sure, there are lows, but the highs are tenfold, and the absolute trust they eventually place on you is humbling. Plus they make [some terrific art](https://imgur.com/a/qDMob) (sorry about the crappy sizing, I ripped them off a FB feed). This is from a show we're launching tomorrow, it's my favourite time of the year with them because the look on their faces when they see all their work hung in a gallery, and when they sell a piece, makes it all worthwhile.
I don't think your mouth opens that wide but you can try 
Facebook.
I love that he mentioned it's a teachable moment rather than just murdering the guy with words.
Well, to be fair, Arnold said it first. 
“Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.”
“Damn immigrants”
r/terminatedbywords
ZIP!!!
One of the best comment I've read tonight.
I think it’s more Arnold’s strive to be the best version of himself. He sees that in those Special Olympians, even if they really can’t compete with the rest of the world. 
Doubt on it, because then it'd be an argument, not a lesson
Bad picture because I had to use flash but you get the idea.  https://imgur.com/a/m4riA
Well.... He straight up fucked him so hard that he gave the guy a midlife crisis.
Which movie is he remember for saying 'nice?' Wasn't that Predator? He killed the alien and was, like, 'Nice!' And high-fived someone? 
"I think we just went from ""shame on you"" to full on assassination"
"""That dirty Austrian took my job as Mr Universe, Terminator and Governor of California""  A dumb loser with a MAGA hat"
Inb4 he actually gets gold
RECRUIT-AH!!! 
Actually, special olympians are incredible athletes, not just compared to other people with disabilities. They absolutely could compete with the rest of the world and beat almost everyone. Several of them beat times from the Rio Olympics in the 1500 m race, for example. 
Sounds like it'd be best if no one had political connections and just did the job that's needed.
that's really nice, your bro has an eye for composition
Having a midlife crisis at 12 means you die at 24
I wish he had made a response. If he didn't maybe he really sat there and reconsidered his beliefs in life. 
Yeah, right after he beat the predator, he said “nice dood! He’s totally dead n’ shit!” And high fived the president, then he got belly scratch, that scene was wierd
"> I think we just went from ""shame on you"" to full on ~~assassination~~ termination  FTFY"
Oh look who it is... Me undies me undies doop Ba doop doooo
I solve this problem by having a never-ending crisis. I will live forever. 
If the Arnold fucking Schwarzenegger broke silence to call me out in some bull shit I said on the Internet, I’d probably do the same.
"""Dude, where's my chopper."""

I like you Faye!
KFC > hospital food
Don't stop til you reach the top
Couple of key points. Let me preface read my entire post. She worked her butt off. She was helped out by the Government program New Step. She is why these programs exist and need to continue to exist. Some people dont have a golden path laid out for them. Some people need help. Legit help.  I'm this case this program helped her by giving her a chance. Add a huge dose of self motivation and straight up desire she achieved her degree. So the next time you read an article or hear someone moan about these program remember her story. Not all government programs are a waste. They can work and they can change lives.
Faye is the success story those of us who work in community colleges live for. She did it, herself. She persevered when some would have given up. You rock, Faye.  Your story makes me so happy to hear, even though I personally had nothing to do with it.  You are amazing. Congratulations!
Wow. Amazing. Heartbreaking. You are my Hero, Faye. You've given me inspiration. Happy Holidays and God bless.
"Whenever I see a ""the dictator"" reference, I upvote "
Do you call it a career, or a bunch of jobs?
Dude: College administration to  jewelry sales to real estate agent and roofer. 
The American dream is real.  However, the American dream is not guaranteed.
The presidency?
You mean you Aladden. 
    A new roof in Florida on average gives about a 71% return on investment. 
American Dream is very much alive, but drive and motivation are not included - they’re required of yourself.
Gotta aim higher than that!
Dictator seems to be the current trend for higher than President. 
Anybody who’s worked up from KFC employee to RN through sheer determination is more trustworthy than our currently leadership.  Faye 2020!
And has far more practical real world knowledge 
I also stayed up til 4am to do my homework. Because I played video games until 2am...
He knows the SAT fee can be waived right?
"""And now I flip burgers again."""
I used to know a Chinese girl who had physically walked/hitched, by herself, from China to Europe to find work and was forced to eat rats along the way. She is now working (and studying), married and a citizen.  A lot of people in this world have it really fucking hard.     
http://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/the-gig-economy-celebrates-working-yourself-to-death/amp  That's great for him but broadly speaking it's an example of extreme individualism. The extreme exception to the rule is not the rule -- hence it's not motivating to be compared to an extreme exception. The subtext here is that all you have to do is just work like crazy -- being very poor and having to work as crazily as he did is actually a problem. There's an obsession with work that's really unhealthy.   Instead of analyzing why someone had to work this ridiculously hard while someone from a wealthier background could achieve the same result but spend much more time being able to actually LIVE their life instead of being a wage slave, we for some reason celebrate the extreme exception to the rule and glorify that as an example instead of looking at the issue systemically, as if individuals exist in a causal vacuum.   For every person like this there are thousands who go the opposite way -- but instead of analyzing the system the culture or broad trends we obsess over individualistic fairytales to defend an utterly broken capitalist economic system and culture. 
"As other comments have pointed out, Harvard ""meets need"" with financial aid and students from poor families can and do finish four years there with little to no debt.  When I taught high school, I tried to encourage some of my students to apply to schools like Harvard and they often refused to do so because they thought it would be too expensive. In part this was because of their parents discouraging them from going anywhere out of state for a variety of reasons. People really don't like their kids moving away. But a larger part is that my students lacked information and the ability to envision themselves going to a place like Harvard. When I tried to explain the financial aid situation, I got a lot of push back from students and parents.  A great deal of motivation comes down to the power to imagine possibilities. I grew up in a poor community and I have had people fight me tooth and nail when I suggest they have potential or that there are opportunities for them elsewhere."
"Only in the United States is this ""motivation."" We have to quit romanticizing the struggle of ""If I Did It, So Can You"" without understanding the lottery like effect of capitalism with things like luck and circumstance. I'm glad this guy is doing things now, but people don't have to struggle like this in Denmark, Germany, etc."
Here's an angle. Imagine if this guy, who obviously is motivated regardless of the challenges life puts forth, imagine if instead of.scrubbing toilets and flipping burgers he'd have been able to spend those hours in a lab, or taking engineering courses, he might have already cured fucking cancer or put a man on mars. Imagine what he could have accomplished if his parent's jobs paid a good middle class wage and he would have had easy access to the internet and not have to raise his siblings. The most explosive growth of both economy and technology this world has ever seen happened after A WII when every veteran had access to as much education as they could handle, union membership was over 50% of the work force, and the middle class was the driving force of this country. THAT'S how we make America great again. 
"OK, as a non-American who has lived in America, why is it always fucking Harvard, and seemingly _only_ Harvard?  There are lots of good universities in the US generating well trained graduates that go on to be successful, sometimes far more successful than people from Harvard, but somehow, if you aren't doing it at Harvard, you just sort of should give up. For some specialties, Harvard isn't considered the the ""best"" anyhow. Especially when it comes to research focused fields.   I always found it weird how people would talk about how they attended a  ""Top Three"" or ""Top Ten"" school for their undergrad in the US.... OK, so how well did you do in your courses and how well did you rank? What skills to you bring that make you valuable and do you have a good attitude? Did you get an education, or just a schooling with a piece of paper at the end?  I care more that someone was rank one in a good-but-not-top university and has all sorts of diverse experience and good references than someone who went to Harvard/MIT/Stanford but looks pretty humdrum and has only their GPA and some bullshit committee they sat on."
This isn't motivation     This is a testament to that man, and his drive, and stamina. What he did would leave others exhausted, broken, depressed and despaired.     This isn't motivation, this is an example of a broken system
Congrats to this dude, I have no doubt he has worked hard and persevered through some pretty tough odds, but honestly, I'm just a little bitter as a middle class kid, just a scrape above working class, who wasn't poor enough for any sort of aid (which I guarantee this guy got some), but who wasn't rich enough to have anything bestowed upon me. I also worked my ass off while in high school and college, not flipping burgers, but wiping little kids' asses at a daycare, and even though I have a good job, I still have a shit ton of debt from just a regular old state school that hangs over my head, and credit, like a black fucking cloud.
His neighbors had unsecured wifi? 
Good for him but I'm not motivated. 
Atleast he's humble though, right guys?
Admirable certainly. Yet sadly, your example mostly gets used to perpetuate a horrendously unfair and broken system.
Is this real? I mean, it's so over the top. The only thing missing is that he had to walk uphill both ways in the snow with holes in his shoes.
Thanks for making me feel like shit today
It's a little to much boosting.. I mean, ' I had to flip burgers...to afford to take the SAT... What's that, like 10burger flips, it's the SAT, you don't need a loan.
You can get an SAT fee waiver if you are too poor to pay for the test fees.
Frank Grimes would be proud
This isn't survivorship bias. Not at all.  brb, gonna do the same shit with the expectation of the same result.
I'm pretty sure being that poor opened a lot of doors for help.
4 years from now you'll be sharing your story of how you sacrificed everything to play games and became a successful esports professional.
I did my homework the class before they're due. I am now a CS major...
We spoilt folks, sometimes I question whether it would have been better to be born lower class to build up the discipline than be born middle class and stay lazy and easily bent
Uh that's what I was wondering too 😂
Wait actually maybe he took it more than 2 times. For me I only received 2 free tests, he should've worded it better
Kudos to this kid, he didn't really have the resources to get a degree and he got it.  But, I am on the same page as you.  Flipping burgers to afford the SAT registration? Fuck, I paid for the SAT myself as well and all I had to do was save 2 weeks of pay (might be pushing it there).  
Shhh, would ruin the story
Ya wondering what his career path is...
$200? Was it Apple though? You cannot hardward without Apple.
"In germany, I would go as far and say that really anyone can go to college (university) if he is moderately smart and can get the ""Abitur"" (degree which allows you to enter a university). No money? College is mostly free (around 100$ per semester) and you get an interest free loan of up to 600$ a month (depending on how much your parents earn) which can be repaid basically whenever you want. You dont even need to work part-time if you dont have much expenses. If you struggle, it is not because of the system. The infrastructure is there if you want it."
It's hard to say what drove him. Maybe living in a shitty situation pushed him to work really hard. Maybe adversity can sometimes create strong people like this who otherwise wouldn't have risen so high.
Networking.  You meet a lot of well off and powerful people in the ivies.   
"I think you're underestimating the caliber and ambitiousness of students at these schools. Imagine the student you described at the ""good-but-not-top university."" At least half the students at ""top ten"" schools are like that, if not better, and this is known among job recruiters, making these degrees more valuable. And the schools basically throw money at them to help them succeed. Of course, you don't have to go to a top school to be successful, but it helps."
My old boss went to Princeton. He knows so many CEO and president types that whenever he needs a favor, he knows who to ask. You know the secret society bullshit? It's real, it's just not a secret, it's an open rolodex of connections (and favors). 
Yeah. The only people I know like that are those who can magically live on small quantities of sleep. Congratulations. You won the genetic lottery and have more time to do things. I would argue that to be a greater asset than any quantity of money. It's a fucking superpower honestly. You get a bunch of extra time each day to do stuff while the clock is effectively stopped for everyone else.
Ivy league schools love that shit.
How else will you play Crysis on medium settings
"That's what you took away from this? You hear a story about someone overcoming terrible circumstances and think, ""Wow, there really is no such thing as privilege,"" really?"

Calisthenics studies? You're not fooling anyone, blood boy! 
You'd just be lower class with same discipline and therefore had likely a worse life overall.
Yes, this happens a lot. If this bewilders you, be happy, because life is good.
You'd be surprised. Poor kids just don't know this stuff.
Philosophy.
Computer Science. It's on his facebook. 
Nah dude I got a Dell. Like this is probably still a great story but it comes off like some shitty campaign ad. 
"I've worked with and for few Harvard/Princeton/Columbia graduates. They were clearly very good, but not nearly as good as the Ivy League-branding and marketing might suggest. Definitely not the academic and intellectual demi-gods some would have you believe compared to ""not top 5"" university graduates. The ego that often came with it gave me reason, as I've become more senior and am now part of the hiring process, to give far less of a preference to people from Ivy League universities. All it takes is one toxic person with a chip on their shoulder to fuck up a whole 30 person team. "
*at 12am*  I'll play until 2 then I call it quits.  *what feels like 10 minutes later, it's now 1:30am*  Hmm, I better finish this dungeon quickly.  *1:55am*  OK 2:30 and that's it  *3:30am*  Gah, I better stop now...  *4am*  Fuck it I'm not even tired I might as well stay up at this point or I'll miss my 7am class. I'll just do a few quests and hunker down.  *5am*  This will be easy, I'm not even sleepy. I did sleep way in yesterday.   *6am and the sun rises, intense fatigue sets in. Eyes become sticky and mood becomes cranky*  That pillow. Holy fuck, it looks so damn comfy. I just need a quick feels, I'll keep my eyes open.  *3pm*  Oh damn that was a nice nap....ohhh fuck.

actually I majored in playing Counter Strike. I even memorized basic Russian phrases. Idi nahui pidoras.
Poor kids don't have anyone willing to help them and tell them that.
"At least he figured out that Harvard offers a lot of financial aid.  Amazing how many poor (and middle class) kids say things like ""I could never afford to go to XYZ"" without ever bothering to apply and see what kind of financial aid offer they might get.  20% of Harvard students don't pay a dime.  60-70% receive at least some amount of financial aid, paying an average of $12k per year.  Other top schools have similar levels of aid.  If you are a top student and only apply to the local cheap school because your parents don't have much money... You are robbing yourself of a huge opportunity!  Get your application fee waived, fill that shit out, and see how much aid they offer!"
I had no idea 
They do not make it easy to find out.  You don' t have a lot of free time and access to knowledgeable counselors is limited at many schools.  If most of your time is spent working and attending classes and the school makes you take half the day off just to see a counselor , often that means you can't see a counselor.  
A philosophy degree from Harvard will still land you most jobs outside of engineering.
Oh a dell? I love all her songs!
Just signed up. They have a thing that says it can be waived in plain view in the counseling dept.
I got so lucky that I had a guidance counselor that gave a fuck. Good for this kid!
I went to an Ivy for just about free. Everybody I meet thinks my family is rich. Do people just not know about financial aid? 
I wish I knew this 10 years ago.  I could've gotten a free ride to UCLA but went to CSUN because I didn't understand FAFSA stuff.
"Yup.  I have a friend with a sociology degree from Harvard.  I have an engineering degree from ""*not* Harvard"".   He's always made at least twice as much as me and I do very well."
Well it's on his linkedin too. Is that less creepier? 
Likely because to get into Harvard, you have to be an extremely dedicated and motivated worker. So even pointless degrees from Harvard mean a lot.
That's a huge part of the reputation part of the equation, but I believe that the connection aspect is even more powerful.    Edit:  Here's a good example of the connection effect.  My friend and I were involved in a startup together long ago.  When it came time to look for funding, he was able to call up his college roommate who just happened to sit on the board of a venture fund.
People who think you go to an Ivy League school for the education don't know how the world actually works.
If you can't take yourself out to a nice meal without feeling like something's wrong, then something is wrong  Edit:  thanks for the love guys. I'll be here all week
Reading this as I sit alone in a restaurant. And I’m taking myself to a movie alone after this. Because it’s Friday, i don’t have to work and I ain’t got shit to do.  Edit: thanks for the silver!   I ended up seeing Captain Marvel. Pretty standard Marvel origin film but I enjoyed it! Thanks for the support!
Wtf? I eat alone in restaurants all the time. It’s my lunch break, I don’t want to talk to colleagues or discuss work. It’s my break lol
Yeah sometimes it’s just nice going and having lunch alone. You don’t always need someone to go somewhere with you (: get comfortable being around yourself and I bet others will love being around you 
Aren't all restaurants public restaurants?
There's a difference between being alone and being lonely.  Maybe she doesn't know the distinction between the two.
When my wife and I had different work schedules I'd do lots of things alone. It was cool. Movies alone are pretty awesome actually. 
lol what?  so you're just supposed to literally be in a group 24/7? sounds fucking exhausting
People who cannot be alone should work on some issues
Nastyboiii spitting the truth
I eat out alone in restaurants all the time by myself. I walk in and they always look at me with a funny look and ask “just for one?” Yep just me! Even when I sit down at a table the server asks me again! Yep the one and only!  I don’t mind it one bit. I younger and have plenty of friends I could go with but sometimes I just enjoy having a nice relaxing meal by myself! Don’t mind who thinks I’m lonely or weird. I like my alone time and I enjoy a nice meal.
Some people are afraid to be alone. 
That sounds amazing!
"I get shat on by friends and family for going to the movies alone. Good to know there are dozens of us purists out there who go for the art and entertainment of film, which is meant to be enjoyed in solitude sometimes.  Edit: Guys, when I say ""shit on me"" i mean that they tease me lightly. It's how we used the term growing up. Thank you all for your concern but it's really a comical thing in my circles. "
I don't want my lunch break to be another hour long meeting about work. So, yeah. eating alone. No problemo.
LMAO this guy doesn't know about secret private restaurants
Excuse me, that's Nastyboiiiii. Put some respect on his name.
Huh, I eat alone all the time and they dont look at me any different. I think it’s in your head dude. I use to work as a server and we couldn’t care less if you were eating alone. It’s actually pretty common.
I’m proud of you 
Same here. My gf doesn't care for sushi, but I love it. So I go it alone. Bring a book. Enjoy my sushi. 
Correction, most people are afraid to be alone.  Thats why so many people get into shitty relationships, the thought of not being in a relationship is insane to them almost.
I eat alone every day. I don’t think it’s confidence or loneliness. It’s indifference. It’s not some sort of statement. I just don’t think about it. 
🤫 don’t let him in on it, it’s our secret
RESPEK
I’d love to eat but there’s nobody around. Guess I’ll starve. 
**BOOYAKASHA**
There's no telling how much hard work went into doing this and his reaction says it all.
That's amazing. I love the ending when he congratulated himself. Made me smile. 
Wow. As someone with Cerebral Palsy, seeing all the positivity towards those with disabilities on Reddit is amazing.   Thank you all.  
What a fucking beast
Honestly he shouldn't be doing power cleans. You can seriously injure yourself from it, and his form is awful. He doesn't get his hips low enough to recieve the weight or his legs into a wide squat stance. His wrists are baring all the weight at the top instead of resting the weight across his delts and top of his chest. It looked like he muscled the weight up rather than exploding through the hips and he barely controlled it at the  top. He's asking for an eventual injury here, this is a highly technical lift. Sorry to rain on the parade, it's really admirable he's still doing intense physical training but he should stick to something that won't potentially injure him. 
i was really hoping he wasnt going to hurt himself, but he nailed it right on
It's rare to have a video I can't make a snarky comment about, but this guy fucking rocked it.
Honestly this is such a bad idea, his knees are caving in, his wrists are bearing all the weight, he should NOT be attempting this. If you have osteoporosis, you shouldn't be doing mma, and if you have cerebral palsy you shouldn't do Olympic weightlifting  Watching this is painful, he should stop for his sake. 
It's great that he can power clean but he's probably going to injure himself
70kg=how heavy in freedom units?
paging /u/GovSchwarzenegger I think this guy might have replaced you as my hero. His form is the best it can be despite his condition.
I appreciate this man's effort and courage but in all honesty his form is way off mark and he should not continue or go for a lower weight or he will end up really injuring himself. First from this angle it's hard to tell but it seems like his back is too arched as he is pulling. Next his wrists are taking too much of the weight burden at the top. His knees are also bending inwards as he is lifting which is very dangerous. All in all out of sheer concern, if he doesn't stop or correct his form he will literally destroy his body. 
You can tell that his brain overcame his body in order to do that. Unreal.
You can also tell by how much he struggled before he lifted it
That radiation of confidence tho
HE IS NUMBER ONE
As [Zach Anner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-Sh8ZuGbMI) would say, cerebral palsy is the sexiest of the palsys.   Edited for clarity. 
The internet (while by no means perfect) seems to always produce the occasional bastion of serenity, where nothing but love and support exists. Wish it would carry over to RL a little better but we're getting there (hopefully)
Such a fucking god.
Of course he is. He's flexing *all the time*
Only one voice of reason in the thread.
Agreed..he should train in ways that are a lot less dangerous. Smith machine, cable system, etc. 
Stupid question, I don't lift weights. Is 70kg much for a normal person with his weight? What Iam going at is that, if that's easy for someone to get to in 1 month, and he went from 20kg to 70kg in 3 years for example I would say its different then him just risking 70kg.
Agreed, I think anyone familiar with lifting can look at that and recognize it's dangerous for him to be doing that 
Yeah that kinda scary to watch
You could always judge the guy in the background for not being more hyped about it?
I winced when I saw his knees buckle the way they did. Everyone in here is being super nice, but the reality is that he's going to injure himself. 
I think if this was posted in /r/fitness people would go nuts over his form lol
About l50 freedoms 
Thank you for showing me. He just became one of my heroes.
I think it’s the other way around
I just realized that its him psyching himself up for it not struggling but it still applies 
Fricken all over man. Inspirational. 
I love Zach Anner! Have you seen him on the talk show? I forget what it's called, but it's fucking amazing!  Found it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ne9wqJdeps
cerebral ballsy
The guy deserves the kudos that everyone is giving for not letting his disability restrict him, but the fact is that there is a way to lift responsibly. I'm not just talking about people that are disabled either. I injured my shoulder pretty bad a while back. If I went back the next day, and tried to PR on overhead press, that wouldn't be brave, it would be irresponsible and dangerous. It's most likely that people getting upset about the form critiques in here are people that don't lift and don't know how badly you can fuck up your body with a bad injury. 
70kg is about 154 lbs, so probably the equivalent of his body weight more or less. It's not extreme but that is still a lot of weight for his wrists to be bearing. His legs are extremely close together during the recievimg, he loses his balance and that weight is coming down potentially on his legs or his throat/chest. Yes 3 years to advance to that weight is a very reasonable amount of time but his technique still exposes him to an awful amount of risk. 
It was, seeing his knees in like that made me very scared for the ligaments and tendons in his knees.   But props to him for ballin out and telling his disability to fuck right off!
Damn you stole my reply
of course they would, dude has cerebral palsy which makes proper form borderline impossible
Or just find a hobby that is not limited by your one, major weakness. 
Don't tell me what to do
i....but....what if....ok i think youre both right? im confused as fuck
Honestly - *and this could be obviously totally wrong as I am making assumptions based off observations of a GIF* - to me it looked like he was waiting for the moment that he could get his brain and body in sync for the move. The way he adjusts and shifts and adjusts and then suddenly, as if everything lined up, he's got that thing soaring up from the ground, into position, and drop!  Pow.  Determination Goal: 100%
Or his brain overcame his brain.
yeah, i was going to say - when weight lifting starts to get REALLY heavy, it becomes a lot more of a mental game no matter who you are. you get better but the things you are lifting are still fucking heavy. so props to this guy for just being able to break that barrier, cerebral palsy or not
He’s got swagger. Good for him! Love to see this kind of spirit and determination - things we all take for granted and could draw our own inspiration from. 
Yes! He's amazing.   If you haven't heard it by now, I would HIGHLY recommend his audiobook. (It's called If At Birth You Don't Succeed).  I've listened to it so many times, and each time I am truly inspired by him.
>It's most likely that people getting upset about the form critiques in here are people that don't lift and don't know how badly you can fuck up your body with a bad injury.  I think you hit the nail on the head here.  I get the feeling that when most people look at that GIF, any imagery of risk/injury that flies through their heads likely consists of fairly tame things like bruises, a sprain, or a pulled muscle.  Problem with explosive movement based olympic lifts is that injuries resulting from uneven stance and poor form usually result in problems that are a bit more serious than that...  More along the lines of stress fractures, compound fractures, muscle/ligament tears, and non-trivial hernias.
Ex-Oly Lifting coach for a CrossFit box here, you're right on almost everything. It would be rediculous to get to this weight over a 3 year period. Disability or not.  With good coaching you can get damn near any level of athlete that is 150 lbs+ to this point in months. It takes years to break past 200 - 250# for amateurs. Anyone with athletic background can break 200 in months @150-170 lbs.  PS I'm really surprised you weren't more critical on the rounded back. The knees are buckling, but the back being rounded is where permanent damage happens.
I saw this gif right after I took my exercise prescription exam (we basically just learned lifts all semester) and it made me cringe hard.  Great on him and I can't imagine all the hardwork it took to overcome his disability, but whoever is allowing him to lift this heavy is doing him a real disservice.  The man is setting himself up for even more dysfunctions later in life if he lifts like this regularly.    In one of my classes I was essentially a personal trainer to a man with CP for the semester and there was a good three weeks he couldn't do anything weight bearing because of a severe tendinitis flare up, and it set his progress back this semesters greatly.  CP is not a progressive condition, so the only way this man's condition will get worse is if he become inactive.  Doing big, heavy lifts like this seems like a sure way to get an injury and make his ass sit on the couch for however long it takes for him to recover, not even thinking about chronic issues down the line.  I know this'll probably get downvoted, even though it's incredibly inspirational, he's probably doing more harm than good to his body lifting this heavy.  Plus, it looks like he's in a crossfit gym, and they're known for screwing healthy people's bodies up with too large of load and bad coaching so honestly I'm pretty concerned for him later down the line.
Damn you stole my observation
Don't worry about it. You're mainly a sack of water anyway. 
 No. You're absolutely right. My 16 year old son has cp, and brain and coordination definitely do need to sync up. When he throws a ball, for example, he draws his arm back, and you can see how hard he's thinking about what so many muscles have to do at the same time. Sometimes it takes about 10 seconds, but he usually gets off a good throw. When he makes a bad one, he has the greatest sense of humor about it. This will sound as cliche as it gets, but he is my best friend and the biggest inspiration. 
His will power overcame his circumstance.
Because you're always high man..
What a fantastic title.
I feel like he understands what the form is supposed to be, and waited for all his body parts to get in the right spot. Then he fucking ripped it off the ground and prayed for the best. Props to him.
Damn, you stole my underwear. Wait... what?
I mean really... you're mostly empty space.  in fact the vast majority of you is nothing.   weird that we can't pass through stuff.  
That doesn't sound cliche at all, my dude. That sounds like you're a good-hearted dude working hard to be a good dad. You get all my respect too.
praying for the best is....probably not the best approach to lifting heavy weights.
"What we intuitively understand to be ""solid"" is what it has been all along, the result of forces between particles. So we aren't really mostly empty space by any meaningful definition of the term."
I agree, this is really cool and all, but I don't really understand how this is overall beneficial for him, it seems like he would be very prone to injuring himself with lifting like that.
...you're not invited to my party
This thread is weird. That form was Hella dangerous. Knees bent like that with all that weight. But now everyone just ignores it? 
He’s still going to take up space in your house, if I’m understanding this all correctly
Her application essay must have been a slam dunk. Did she just staple a copy of her book to the form
.... maybe I actually *don't* have a good excuse to skip class.
What an incredible young woman. Survived a Taliban assassination attempt and won The Nobel Peace Prize at age 17, the youngest Nobel Prize winner in any field.
As a uni student with no motivation... This does not help my self image at all.  She'll finish 3 years before me.
That one was of my favorite classes in college! Philosophy of Logic. 
"Normally these ""curated pictures of study space"" photos are obnoxious...  But if anyone deserves to be able to share one, I can't think of anyone better."
Yah OK but does she have tiny pants for pockets
I'm glad she's an international treasure. We need more like her who provide inspiration. Let's just hope they get to that point without a tragic back story.
I can see the logic
I remember learning about her in civics class a while ago. My teacher had watery eyes just talking about her
Jeez, why does their term start so late? October 9?
Undergraduate Starter Pack:  Macbook Multiple books Motivational quote
I went to school in England, my school had a family come over from Zimbabwe that had fled danger there and claimed asylum in the UK. I remember one of the family was in my school year and she was a really awesome inspirational girl much like Malala.   After talking to her she explained to me she’s never actually been able to attend school prior to living in England, yet she was astonishingly intelligent and was immediately top of every single class.   Having been denied the opportunity of school previously she never really missed a day, was always on time and was laser focused on learning. She didn’t take the offer of free education for granted and inspired me at least to try a little harder, realising I’d been taking school for granted.   She landed a place at a top university to my knowledge also. 
FUCK YES
No just a picture of her Nobel 
I'd be amazed if they even asked her to write one
IIRC, she had the results to get into Oxford, and got AAA on her A-level exams.
"Imagine her first day in class, teacher notices her and goes:  ""Ah yes, Miss Yousafazai. Our. New. Celebrity."""
I am genuinely curious, for someone like her do the schools just ask her to attend?
I think this explains it: https://pics.me.me/biggest-gaudiest-patronuses-toreverravenclaw-okay-of-course-im-happy-that-malala-got-27455947.png 
And here I was trying to justify skipping my class tomorrow 
Yea her story made me get myself in gear to take school seriously and graduate highschool. We take for granted our education while at the same time people are willing risk their lives for just a portion of what we get.
"**EDIT 4** I'm making a very simple stance, this is ""Get Motivated"", and I think it's disingenuous to use things like this because they aren't things the average person can just do. Motivation should mean that you're going to try your best to reach a goal, not hope you're lucky enough to be a 1-in-a-million chance of having all the pieces fall right for you. It's ridiculous to pretend any random Pakistani villager girl could have done this, the biggest factor for her success was simply being lucky to have been chosen by big media to be the face of the issue. It's like posting a link of the survivors of the Vegas Shooting that are all over the media now, let's say some of them write some books and say ""get motivated"". How does that make sense? My issue isn't the post itself, it's the context of being used in this sub. I'm an entrepreneur, one that came up from nothing as well. I find the idea of Motivation and Inspiration incredibly important, that's why I take personal defense when I see posts like this. Motivation should be realistic and informed, or else people end up quitting because they burn out, give up, or get discouraged when they don't see results like this.   --- --- To be fair, a lot of it is with the help of media PR. There are scores of young girls that go through what she did, and are probably still in some random village.   I'm not saying her story isn't great. But it's delusional to try and say she did this on her own. Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, was/is a diplomat who worked with the very things she's working on and has many ties with the western diplomats and world stage (such as the UN). The BBC also used her to run columns on the Taliban. I'm not saying she's not a smart girl, I'm just saying she was molded, coached, and helped to be like this by her father, special interest groups with an agenda and narrative to push (albeit a good one, ending violence), and the media. Some random girl with no ties wouldn't have been able to do this sort of thing. Her attempted assassination was more so because of her links and less so because of her herself. I think she's a great person and her story and work are going to hopefully change the lives of many young girls. I'm simply saying she is the face of a team and not a one-person show.   Something I also don't like is that she basically says that Islam plays no role in a lack of women's' rights, violence, or education. Which I think is just ridiculous.  I've seen her speak in person and had a short conversation with her, and I just can't agree with half the things she says. In most of her speeches, she spends the first 10min talking about Islam being a religion of peace and how great it is. Sure, the Islamic Terrorist extremists are a tiny minority and shouldn't be used to make statements about Islam, BUT I think when it comes to women's rights it is pretty fucking clear where the religion stands since the majority of countries ruled by it have a very clear gender gap. I just think it's ridiculous that she's basically going to pretend everything that happened to her wasn't directly caused by the religion, including the educational barriers. For the record, I'm Iranian myself and have some Muslim family members, so I'm not some racist white dude. I have seen what that religion has done to my country, and it's all bad shit. Heck in Iran just a few years ago the Ayatollah forced laws that kept women from getting any STEM degrees, and his reasoning was DIRECTLY due to Islam, so I just can't stand when people try to say it's not. Even if it's not to them (their way of practicing it), the fact of the matter is that the religion is influencing the lives of many women negatively. So I think it's crazy ironic that she stands there talking about women's educational rights while at the same time wanting to spread Islam. Look, I'm not trying to hurt feelings or make some anti-Islam rant, I'm just giving the facts and they happen to be negative. Women's rights are the lowest in countries ruled by Islamic influence/leaders, if that hurts your feelings, go do something about it. I mean, shit, it's almost 2018 and Saudi Arabia is on the news for doing a great ""leap forward"" by allowing women to drive. I mean come on....  ---  **EDIT:** I never said the agenda or narrative weren't great ones. They're fantastic. My whole point is that  Her father was a diplomat that raised her to be like that, he was also deeply tied with the UN, and the BBC backed her to run those stories. She wasn't some random Pakistani village girl. And,  [as one user mentioned, who is Pakistani, many people from there see her as a western pawn.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/75cn03/image_malala_yousafzais_first_day_as_a_student_at/do59p6a/). She wasn't some David vs a Goliath, she had the Goliath behind her. My whole point is that it's a little disingenuous for this story to be ""motivational"" as if any random girl in a village in Pakistan could do this.   **EDIT 2** I find it interesting that this top comment of mine is almost at 1,000 upvotes, but my replies to people disagreeing with it, are deep negatives. I guess I triggered some people. It seems many people read the words ""narrative"" or ""agenda"" and automatically assumed I meant it was some nefarious plot. I'm sorry you all are so sensitive and itching to pick up pitchforks that reading those words makes you think someone is trying to hurt your way of life, instead that maybe, they're on your side.  **EDIT 3** Don't comment asking me for a source because it means you basically don't know anything about this topic other than a few yt videos. Everything I'm saying is in her book and in her own documentary, so the source is right from her and available for all of you.  "
Don't stress yourself out. A lot of people go to college for 7 years.
Omigod the worst part of growing up is finally seeing the things people your age or younger accomplish reach the news.
"I've been there, believe me. My degree took 5 years so I know what it's like when you have no motivation with 3 years left. You just have to take it one step at a time. Put one foot in front of the other. Take breaks when you need to. Reward yourself for completing an assignment by watching an episode of something on Netflix or have a snack. But don't give up. Where you get through this rough patch, you will say to yourself, ""you know what? It was fucking difficult but I did it"". There will always be challenges, the key is how you attack them. I believe in you that you can finish this assignment or this test or this semester or this degree successfully. You have it in you! You just need to find it! Believe in yourself! Because that is what is going to get you through to the end :)   -much love from a recent college grad "
Eh...Call me when Malala starts shitposting
I agree. What I find hilarious about this particular back story, dark as it may be, is that the people who shot her failed so miserably in their quest. They literally gave her the international attention she needed to win a Nobel peace prize. That fact brings me great joy. Malala is a true badass.

We have three eight/nine week terms a year, we end up starting late so we don't have more time than that before we get off for winter holidays.
PPE - Politics, Philosphy and Economics
Oxford probably just auto mails an acceptance letter to any nobel winner
She wore it on a gold chain to the interview.
Probably the most highly recruited person to a University for non-athletic purposes.
They granted her automatic acceptance...dependent on her exam scores. I'll find a source and update. 
I mean, let's be honest here, stupid people don't generally get themselves shot campaigning for education.
"""10 points from Pakistan"""
Turn to page three hundred and ninety four. 
Yes, all fees are likely exempt and room and board provided.
And here I am after just having slept through my class feeling like a lazy ass
A year ago, I couldn’t have cared less. I watched a video of her and was all lol, she put so much effort and I don’t give a shit about school. Then, a few months ago, it just hit me about how lucky I am and I’ve been appreciating it a lot more now. 
Staying in the public eye and speaking put and puts her at risk though, she's not a passive victim.
Her father was also very anti-Taliban and encouraged her to blog and write about what was happening. The documentary He Named Me Malala goes into how much of an advocate her father was not just for girl’s education but education in general. 
"Imagine being a little girl who decides she wants to speak out about girls' education, gets fucking shot, survives, decides to continue speaking out about the issue despite her attempted assassination, writes a book, inspires little girls everywhere, wins the Nobel Peace Prize, and then some random person goes ""BUT TO BE FAIR A LOT OF LITTLE GIRLS ARE JUST AS OPPRESSED."" Because that's why she won her prize and got shot. Because she was oppressed. Not her activism efforts before and after getting capped. "
I mean, it's not like getting shot was her only accomplishment. Even before the attack, she was already becoming prominent for her educational activism.
You don't realize. She was already outspoken well before they tried to kill her, thus why they did. It wasn't random chance. She's been doing this for a long time and stuck to it despite opposition. 
Yeah and they're called doctors. ^^^whatwasthisfrom?
I've been in college for 7 years and have no plans of quitting for at least another 5.  At some point the university will run out of majors, but not yet...
PPE at Oxford is the standard route up for a huge number of British Conservative politicians - David Cameron being the most recent PM to study it, and of the current cabinet Alan Duncan, Jeremy Hunt, Damian Green, Philip Hammond and Liz Truss all studied it.  (And for Labour, both Miliband brothers and Ed Balls.)  I'm genuinely really curious what it'll be like for her studying alongside so many of the posh boys fresh out of Eton and Harrow.
I know how to use Microsoft Word. 
I never pegged Oxford to be one for athletic based recruitment 
Hiring students just for their athletic purposes isn't really a thing in the UK. Even those who are good at rowing.
But at the same time, bravery doesn't equal intelligence. She's obviously proven herself to be very intelligent, but she was campaigning for education precisely because education availability to girls was so terrible. 
It's true. Universities are big on prestige. If you are someone who lifts their profile then you get a free ride.   
Yes, in some respects she's very lucky, not just for surviving, but having parents who encouraged her pursuits and education. And hell, she got shot for it.   Now imagine what thousands of girls like her go through, who are also attacked by their own families :(
THANK YOU, why do people on reddit suck so much
">""Hey man I just wanted to point out she's not really special. ~~She~~You should give up because there's so many others out there that aren't her."""
That's why she was shot in the first place, right?
Tommy Boy.  Shut up, Richard. 
"""No, Malala, this is not what the author meant""."
Congratulations, you are accepted to DeVry Univarsity.
Don't sell yourself short, you're *proficient* at Microsoft Word 
Rowing is a big deal between them and Cambridge
Oh no I know, I'm simply saying specifically on the topic of education, if you care about your education that much, that's a pretty good indicator it's something you find beneficial and that you excel at.  Bravery doesn't equal intelligence, but you're not likely to find stupid children putting their lives on the line for more education.
Faces covered in acid burns don't move as many magazines.
Yeah. The attacker stopped the bus she was on and asked for her, specifically, to identify herself before he shot her.
As someone who skipped class more than attended in highschool, I'm grateful for colleges with low barriers to entry. Now maintaining a 4.0 at DeVry. Second chances are nice.
My  dude, no one does 
"So is rugby. The annual Oxford vs. Cambridge game at Twickenham is huge. It's called The Varsity Match.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Varsity_Match  I only know this because an old colleague of mine once told me that he ""scored a try for Oxford in The Varsity Match at Twickenham"". I was like ""Bruh, what are you talking about?"""
And then she continued fighting for girls to have an education. I think most 13/14 year olds (and most adults much older) would give up after an assassination attempt.
Just a heads up, community colleges are basically barrier free. As long as you graduated highschool or received a GED you can enroll in classes. Its often cheaper than for-profit school like DeVry, and less likely to lose its accreditation. They also usually have transfer agreements with the local universities, and classes are more likely to transfer. Glad you are pursuing higher education though! 
Kick ass and don't stop there!
All of them
"Okay ""twickenham"" has gotta be made up right? It's impossible to be THAT British right? "
All 4 of the major colleges in my state do not accept any course work/ grade exchanges from any for profit college.   But congrats on the 4.0 at DeVry.   However as previous poster mentioned community colleges do tend to be acceptable and more likely allow you to keep any existing grades and coursework when you transfer to University.

What you're doing is called mobilizing and it's a core skillset for cognitive behavior therapy when dealing with depression.  Keep it up, I'm making my own list.  EDIT - Typo  EDIT EDIT - Sweet Christmas, this blew up.  For those of you asking, here is book I got this from - https://www.amazon.com/Thoughts-Feelings-Harbinger-Self-Help-Workbook/dp/1608822087  If you want a little more information about mobilizing specifically as it relates to that book, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/7yryxu/image_found_a_note_from_2_months_ago_made_a_few/duixvho/).
Solid progress. Keep it up!
The last update was the best!
Also you have neat handwriting!
Thanks for this post, I’ve haven’t been productive today but if I compare myself to where I was 2 months ago too, I have actually made very similar changes. Started being sober in January, and went on Prozac for depression and it has been amazing. Things have generally been getting better since then, but I just need to keep getting through these bad days!   Keep it up. From one stranger to another, I’m proud and rooting for you!!! 
You’re killing it OP! Keep it up!   Also, what could you add to this list do you don’t become stagnant? 
- ~~Lack of sweet sweet Reddit karma~~  Front page y'all
Is this a thing? Which is awesome if it is - because I did a similar list when I was really upset about heaps of things. On one side I wrote all the negative things and then on the right hand side I wrote a solution or a strategy to shift my thinking. It super helped that one time but I didn’t realise that it could have been the activity that helped me. Will keep this in mind to do at any time I’m feeling low - such a good strategy and thanks for confirming that it’s a core skill set. 
Thank you!  edit: hi-jacking my own comment for visibility  Thank you guys for the kind words tonight, I wish I could read through more of your replies tonight but I ended up soaking in all of your good vibes for longer than I should have and ended up avoiding my math homework. I've never seen so many wholesome replies in one post and it swells my heart man, it really does. I love you all, stay motivated!
Haha moving my bed? It made a world of difference. Now I associate one room with sleep and the other with studying, working, and entertainment. 
Not really, it was a list of reasons that I thought were making me feel useless at the time.  At the time of writing this comment, I don't really feel useless :)  I could however create a separate list for goals I wish to accomplish in the next two months!
I lost 151 b's, please help me find my b's
I do this all January and I make it a New Years holiday. It makes New Years my favorite holiday now. I write down goals, successes, failures and how to fix the failures. It has drastically changed my life in such a short amount of time. I’m a completely different person than I was three years ago. Three years to me seems like ten.   Whenever I’m in a slump I start to make a plan to get out of it. 
"I'm new to all this, honestly, but the idea is to categorize key life value's that are important to you.  You then compare your life's current key value's and then make adjustments.  For example, say OP said one of his key value's was ""fitness or health""  OP would write: ""I feel like shit because I'm drinking, I'm not eating right and I'm over weight.""     OP would then write out what they would do to fix it - go to the gym, eat better, and exercise.  Then OP needs to do it and the thought of doing it (mobilizing) reduces the feelings of uselessness and all that bullshit associated with depression.  Keep doing this until your existing key value's match the ones you wanted.  It's not a be all end all and it's not a fix for professional help or medication to level your mood out.  But if you're interested, please check out [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Thoughts-Feelings-Harbinger-Self-Help-Workbook/dp/1608822087).  Depression is chapter - 11, 2 ,3, 4, 12, 20, 15, 16, and 9 (in that order).  Good luck!"
Getting a solid nights sleep is so much easier when you’re not drinking,  just one of the many positives.
Plus your room is not so tiny anymore with that big bed out of the way!
Bedrooms should only be for sleep and sex.
Was sober for 4 years, got stagnant and complacent.  Now im smoking crack and drinking every day.. Talk about useless.  Keep the list going.  If your not moving forward your moving backwards. 
I'm 65 and I think life is really all about our recoveries..
Thank you. I'm barely hanging on. This gives me some solid ground. 
From personal experience, it's also much easier when you're not watching pornography.
There’s so much more room for activities now
"Look at Mr. Rico Suave over here with all his ""sex"""
also, graphology is a pseudoscience.
Last year I was IV’ing meth and heroin, I’m not going to tell you that quitting drugs is easy because it’s not. It took me losing multiple jobs due to absences from being sick all the time and plain disgust to stop buying them. Even now I still get cravings but I apply game theory against the me that wants to get high versus the me that wants to succeed in life. The chance of relapse is still high though, just recently I had to talk to someone that used to use and she helped me out by referring a sponsor to me. There is no trick, just have to at least get past the withdrawal stage and get help from someone if you can’t trust yourself. 
I think that applies to watching anything on your phone. Porn specificly likely isn't the issue.
I didn't say I was having any
Porn addiction is a very real thing.
I don't think that was being contested. Light from a screen, regardless of what's being watched, will make it hard for your brain to switch off for sleep.
A farmer and his son had a beloved stallion who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away and their neighbors exclaimed, “Your horse ran away, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”  A few days later, the horse returned home, leading a few wild mares back to the farm as well. The neighbors shouted out, “Your horse has returned, and brought several horses home with him. What great luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”  Later that week, the farmer’s son was trying to break one of the mares and she threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. The villagers cried, “Your son broke his leg, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”  A few weeks later, soldiers from the national army marched through town, recruiting all the able-bodied boys for the army. They did not take the farmer’s son, still recovering from his injury. Friends shouted, “Your boy is spared, what tremendous luck!” To which the farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”  The moral of this story, is, of course, that no event, in and of itself, can truly be judged as good or bad, lucky or unlucky, fortunate or unfortunate, but that only time will tell the whole story. Additionally, no one really lives long enough to find out the ‘whole story,’ so it could be considered a great waste of time to judge minor inconveniences as misfortunes or to invest tons of energy into things that look outstanding on the surface, but may not pay off in the end.  The wiser thing, then, is to live life in moderation, keeping as even a temperament as possible, taking all things in stride, whether they originally appear to be ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Life is much more comfortable and comforting if we merely accept what we’re given and make the best of our life circumstances. Rather than always having to pass judgement on things and declare them as good or bad, it would be better to just sit back and say, “It will be interesting to see what happens.”   Edit: Didn't expect this to take off, I didn't write this I got it from this website  http://www.drmarlo.com/?page_id=181

I needed this today. I missed the deadline for a job application I've been working on for a week because I misread the deadline. I am so upset and so angry with myself, because if I hadn't waited until the last minute, I wouldn't be in this situation. Even though I'm so angry with myself, I have to believe that maybe not applying and not getting this job will be the best thing that never happened.   Edit: Thanks to all your encouraging comments, I sent the application in anyway to their general email server. It's worth a shot!   Also, I thought about what The Rock would do and went to the gym to SWEAT IT OUT. Feeling so much better but thanks again for your inspiring comments!! 
Coming in late, but I was in this awful relationship with this guy a while back that I was completely infatuated with. I wanted it to work out so badly and was stupidly into him.   He started showing his true colors soon enough and I was lucky enough to catch on. We were still on good terms though, so I went to this away weekend with him for an organization he was a part of. He had asked me to go with him when we were still together and even though I didn't like him anymore, I didn't want to back out last minute because we were still friendly.   Literally everyone told me not to go. They didn't like him and thought that I'd get sucked back in.   Anyway, I go to this resort and the first night I'm there, I break my leg and ankle. I went back home fuming and kicking myself (not literally) for not listening to my friends.   Fast forward and I'm sitting in this lobby between college courses because I don't want to crutch all the way home. I wouldn't have been there if my leg wasn't broken. Ended up meeting this amazing guy and am now in the healthiest relationship I've ever been in.   Made all the bad stuff worth it. I'm so glad things didn't work out with the other guy. I'm so glad I broke my leg. No regrets. 
I've been there. It's an amazing experience to lose everything. 
The hardest part is in that moment though. The moments leading up to it and the moments after. Chances are, he knew playing in the CFL that his NFL dreams were on the ropes, but he may have been in denial.   So he gets sent home with $7 to his name. I want to know how he got himself back up after that? Granted, he was a star D1 football player and his dad and Grandpa were hall of Fame wrestlers, so he had a little more leverage than 99% of people getting into wrestling but still...  He had to cash in on that chance. How did he get by, knowing *that* was his only chance? How did he keep going even when he failed at wrestling, during the time when people were chanting “Rocky sucks” and they had gone the wrong way with him creatively?   The Rock seems to be one of the few people who still remembers his lowest point. Of course there’s survivorship bias in what he says, but I would love for him to say how he got through that doubt. How he got through all those days when he had no idea at all what the next day would bring.   Anyway, I’m rambling. It just made me really happy to see someone understand that it’s not just “Has motivation, ???, Mega-stardom” and that was nice. 
This is how I feel when someone on Reddit sees my username and proceeds to tell me that they're sorry for my bad luck.

I live in vancouver and I love it. I just love the vibe in this city. 
"I had 14 tabs open on my computer for some open jobs in my area that looked promising. After applying to the first 13, I saw did a little research and learned that the 14th was with an amazing award winning company. I was glad I had finished 13 other resumes and cover letters and was ready to give my best submission on this one. Then when I went to submit the page refreshed and said that the job posting had closed.   Because I had already written the cover letter and resume, I decided to apply for a similar position and also I went to the office and hand delivered my resume to the security desk with a post-it note on top that said ""To Marketing Director, I saw the Paid Search Manager position and tried to apply online but the listing closed so you can find my application under the social media position and right behind this post-it note""  Well, it turns out that they filled the position with an internal transfer but he was also applying externally so he ended up leaving after 2 days and my resume was on the top of the pile. I got an interview and ended up with an offer better than any of the other offers from that whole application process. It has been a great job and I am so glad I printed and delivered my resume that day."
Just apply anyways, through email if you have to.  Express why you messed up in a sincere manner and note how much you want it.  You never know.
It's only when we lose everything that we're truly free

How the fuck did he get dropped when he's literally a brick wall
This needs to be higher. Why not post the original fucking youtube video?? There's no benefit in watching a shrunken gif with tiny captions!

Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see. 
Turns out to be a pro football player you have to be exceptionally good at the football part too.
They're all brick walls of muscle. It's just some brick walls are better at football than other brick walls.
Because that isn't even the original video.   That's a link to some Youtube-Leech taking from the Rock's Instagram.
I don't live there but I spent a few months working there.  My take:  Great place to eat, terrible place to drink.  Fashionable, expensive, hollow.  Downtown seems to have no soul.  Half empty buildings of million dollar condos everywhere.  The housing market is fucked.
Hopefully, you didn’t break it.  We will see.

I'm finally relevant.
I have a four day weekend and did one load of laundry on day two. it felt just like this.   I also watched GoT.
So true. When I'm feeling down just start doing one thing. Any thing. Send an email follow up with a friend you haven't spoken to etc. it helps a lot.
This feels just like what happened to me today! I decided finally I'm going to go to the gym, as I'm terrified of the place. That I'm never gonna get anywhere if I don't do something. Its funny how things work out because I got a positive response to a job application just after going and it seems like I have been rewarded for going to the gym!
I've been diagnosed with chronic depression. On really bad days, I have to congratulate myself for such trivial 'accomplishments' as clipping my nails, or even just getting out of bed to open the blinds or turn on a light in order to try and 'get the ball rolling' so to speak.
That's a non-zero day!

Yeah, hearing about it really is no substitute for *seeing* Drogon eat Tyrion.
I could honestly use a hug. 
Any time, kind Internet stranger! :D
It is known.
/r/wholesomememes
You know nothing, Sarah the Lizard.
He SEAL. He heal. But most importantly he become new Neil.
These photos are in the wrong order and it bothers me.
That is arguably one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen. I can hardly cook canned soup.
He fights for our country.  He fights for our health.  He fights for the progression of mankind.  *Not all heroes wear capes.*
His cv must look fake as shit 
This guy is my age. I'm sitting in a recliner, stoned, dipping pizza rolls into BBQ sauce.  We live 2 completely different lives
Well this makes me feel like a waste of life
He's a Navy Doctonaut
When this guys runs for president I'll vote for him just so he hits more markers
I get it this dude is better than me. Why is it motivating?
The story of his life accomplishments are enough to make 3 Mark Wahlberg movies about.
Get motivated. Look at this man doing all this before he is 35. What did you do? You dont suck at all. ... /:
He knows the cheat codes. 
So first he killed people, then he tried to save people and when nothing worked now he wants to leave the planet ???
"""Roses are red""  ""Violets are blue""  ""There is always an Asian""  ""Better than you"""
This is extremely motivational when you're 15, but very depressing e set the same time when you're 35 and not quite there yet... 
He mastered the stars;  Honed strength for darkened battle;   Fixing owies now. 
This does not motivate me at all. This does the opposite. Like the way seeing someone richer, more popular, more attractive. and more intelligent doesn't motivate you - it just makes you feel smaller.  Good for that guy though.
Clap, clap, clap...well played
Never seen a Navy seal wear white doctor scrubs or a doctor wearing a mil uniform? Or Space force marine?   Edit. Space force Seal. He isn't a marine.
I created a Reddit account to comment on this because I have worked him personally.   He was an intern when I was a medical resident at Massachusetts General Hospital.   Yes he is married with kids. I have no doubt his parents are proud. But that is not the point.   He is super hard working and incredibly nice and humble. He just gets shit done without complaining.   Johnny is one of those few people that get to where he is by just working his ass off, being helpful to others, and being a good human being. What an inspiration he is. 
When I was a teenager I had an older Vietnamese GP. Born into poverty in Vietnam, fought in the war, was a POW and immigrated to Germany before coming to America to be a Dr. He's fluent in four languages. We golf together and he definitely Asian dads the shit out of me. I feel bad for kids that grow up living the Asian parent meme.
We're joking, but I'm guessing that's what he's dealing with.   I'm 35..successful enough and I get daily reminders on if there's grandchildren otw and my mother in law acting like her daughter will dry up.
Trick is to get pre-cooked soup in a can. Then even if you fail re-heating, it's still fully cooked soup.
He protecc   He attacc   He go space and come bacc 
This guy should definitely have a damn cape
When johny Kim applies for a job, he hires the employer. 
Seriously I’d read this and go “right...”
I work at one of the Harvard affiliated hospitals and I would just like to say that most of the CVs look fake.  One year we had four new research fellows in our group and two had listed that they had performed at Carnegie Hall.  And somehow all seemed to have worked at WHO at some point. And the place is filled with Rhodes Scholars.   Nothing is impressive anymore.
Fuck man going mustang isn't easy either, dude just took the hard path on everything and conquered it all.
I'm waiting for Jocko to get him on the podcast
Can someone explain that last sentence for the non military folks like me
That doesn't sound too bad.
“So there I am, barbecue sauce on my titties”
[He seems pretty humble](https://youtu.be/6m43RSoibhw)
I happen to actually know him and he’s the nicest guy.  EDIT: we’re both members of the same veteran’s organization since 2012.
I genuinely hope we one day have this man as our president. If he can accomplish this much in such a short time with seemingly absolute discipline, integrity, and leadership then just imagine what he could accomplish as the leader of the country. A real hero and true inspiration right here.
I actually worked with Jonny during his residency at MGH (Massachusetts General Hospital), including when he was being interviewed by news stations while he saw patients I was working with. He was always incredibly humble and would never talk about all of his accomplishments, even as he was the face of MGH for a bit. Patients would ask him about it if they recognized it but he never seemed to flaunt it. He’s every bit the calm, compassionate, humble, and brilliant person that you would want to watch your six, care for your family member, or travel out of the atmosphere with. He’s one of the good ones!  
It shouldn't. We all have different paths to take. Your path is to waste life.
Don't fret. You play an important role in filling out the central part of the curve by which exceptional people may be judged exceptional.
He’s only 34, he has time.  Also has time to marry a Kennedy and become governor of California 
Guy would be a mindfuck for both parties. The right would love that he's a decorated Vet and a bonafide doorkicker, the left would love that he's young, educated, and not white. If he was remotely charismatic and somewhat religious he'd have a shot, maybe not for the presidency right away, but he could definitely grab a seat in the House or the Senate. Getting into politics would arguably be a step down. 
They don't let people like this be president any more. The bar is now set so low it would be step down for him and a worse job.
Seriously, it's almost demoralizing to know that this guy is out there being ridiculously good at everything
I have a feeling he's better at me than my own specialty (applied math) on top of being amazing at all those things he's also done. Thanks for the demotivation OP, I sure felt too good about myself lately 
Written by Mark Wahlberg and starring mark Wahlberg. Where the real life guy cameos as random man on street. 
When I see these kind of stories, I walk over to a mirror and look myself deep into my eyes. And I get this feeling that I can do this too. I can also achieve something like that, as long as I invest more time into educating myself and improving myself on every single level. I smile, accompanied by this soothing feeling that everything will be ok. Then I head back to my computer and continue to surf the reddits.
I served in the Navy.   Got an art degree.   Work in business....  ...ugh. It’s been down hill for a while. 
Discipline, dedication, and perseverance. 
Lmao I wake up at 1:00 pm
Am doctor. Recently used my fingers to check some simple arithmetic. Also tried to drink a coke before taking the cap off the bottle today. Also used spell check to spell arithmetic. We ain’t all that smart 
Not smarter. Dedicated.   Motivation, desire, commitment: You need those things to endure the hours upon hours of study, the 30+ hr residency days for weeks, and the constant blows to your confidence.  Self sacrifice:  you need this when you pass up partying, social life, and time loved ones.   I’m not trying to blow sunshine up your ass, but brains are only a portion of what it takes. Sure you can’t be a dumbass, but even smart people don’t always commit to making themselves great. Even people with athletic or musical talents squander them due to lack of commitment. Yes, pure talent exists, and when it meets dedication that’s when an Einstein, Phelps, or Mozart (etc) are born.    The most demanding (and arguably prestigious) careers demand everything from you.  Only those who are committed will make it. The rest of us are great people capable of great things, we just never get the inspiration/motivation to fully commit. Or we choose a more diverse life full of variety, because we don’t want to sacrifice everything in pursuit of a passion.   Sorry for the rant, but people easily attribute achievements to a singular gift instead of all the hard work required to really succeed.  TL,DR; get motivated and you can be whatever you want. 
Everyone knows the only way to write dates correctly is soldier/doctor/astronaut 
He’s wearing a wedding ring in the astronaut photo!
Isn't all canned soup pre-cooked...?
This is beautiful.
He has a cape canaveral
his friend johny sin is also a multi-talented individual. he is a doctor, plumber, teacher and much more.
So what your saying is that I could probs get away with it as long as I don’t go overboard? Got it thanks.  Expect an application on your desk from david3692, god of thunder PHD 
HARD mode is the default on all the games he plays.
Seconded. 
Mustang is going from enlisted to commissioned. Pretty difficult to do. 
We should hang more
I always wondered what their selection is like. I bet the interview is intense
He seems like a good dude
For those that don't know. Mass Gen and Brigham Women's hospital are two of the most prestigious and respected hospitals in the country 
I know /u/nummularius and you can take his word. He's very truthful.
That's a lie perpetuated by people who have skeletons in their closet.
Pfft I was expecting something completely motivating then i was hit with a fastball of reality 
Lol you deserve that gold
Dr Astroseal? 
That's amazing rofl 
"""This dude has been in the zone for over ~~four~~ three decades!"""
How would it be in metric?
Fuckkkkk. Imagine being his kid. We all try to live up to the stereotype but this kid's dad will have done it, three fold.
He delivered my pizza once. Extra sausage like I requested. Gave him a tip of course. 
Hey Jamie, pull that up.
I still don't understand, how does he get comissioned and what does that mean? 
Whatcha doing for New Years?
>I bet the interview is intense  I think it's just in an office, but maybe a tent is a good place to interview someone thinking of going to space. Get a feel for their comfort in small spaces.
He seems like a very good dude
Man look at his [fellow astronaut candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astronaut_Group_22) in his group. It's like oozing with credentials.
Doctor/soldier/astronaut
Imagine being his fuck up sibling.
Well, English isn't my first language so it always feels good when I can say something remotely funny to native speakers. 
Have you tried DMT? 
"The ""normal"" paths in the military are to enlist, which you can do straight out of high school with virtually no experience (although education and life skills can help you get a better assignment), or to be commissioned as an officer after graduating from one of the nation's military academies, getting a degree while participating in ROTC, or graduating with a degree and enrolling in OCS (officer candidacy school). You then proceed on and receive promotions advancing in rank in your specific side. As a gross over simplification, enlisted are the people who make things happen (from front line combat, to cooks, to mechanics and construction) while officers are the high level decision makers, translating high level directives from congress and the president into operational instructions for the enlisted personnel.  To cross from enlisted to commissioned officer is difficult, and uncommon. In some cases, you'll be seen as an outsider by both enlisted and other officers.  Please feel free to correct any details - I'm not in the military myself but my grandfather did 28 years as an officer, and my uncle did 10. "
Getting ripped and having some cheap champagne. You?
And the cycle continues
Mr. President? Why not Dr. President?
Imagine being his incredibly accomplished but not as acconplished as their brother sibling
I kinda disagree for the army. It's not that uncommon to drop an OCS packet after being enlisted for a while. They certainly aren't the majority but not insanely rare.   Also, prior enlisted officers are overwhelmingly the favorite officers from the enlisted perspective. They stand out, mainly because of their competency in the junior officer ranks, but I wouldn't call them outsiders. (Could be to other officers though)  Not trying to be combative, just giving my .02
Drinking sparkling wine. Waiting to gtfo of Afghanistan lmao.
Actually.... That is a HUGE part of Astronaut Training.  Desert survival/Navigation/Orienteering. They do go camping.  Some of the training involves living in a geodesic dome and only venturing outside in the high desert in a space suit. You're camping.  I would LOVE to be an astronaut one day. But I'm thinking more commercial spaceflight than NASA Astronaut Scientist.
Came here to see this chain.  I knew it had to be here.  
Damn. I'll drink to that. Good luck, stay safe
Of course it would be here.   Source: Asian, and a disappointment.   Edit: My dad was the disappointment but my parents gave us a fun childhood. I married a white woman and our kids are laid back. As far as I’m concerned, my dad is a success.   &nbsp;   
I’m now invested in this friendship, please update 
"Reeve remembered his first impression of Williams when they were new students at Juilliard:      > He wore tie-dyed shirts with track suit bottoms and talked a mile a minute. I'd never seen so much energy contained in one person. He was like an untied balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in awe as he virtually caromed off the walls of the classrooms and hallways. To say that he was ""on"" would be a major understatement.     Two awesome friends. "
Robin William's was a beautiful soul. Rest in Peace
I wish Robin Williams had a Robin Williams... I really miss that comedian.
I bet Reeves welcomes Williams into the afterlife...  ...Reeves wearing scrubs and face mask, loudly demanding to examine Williams rectum.
Christopher Reeve and Robin Williams were classmates at the Juilliard School and remained close friends throughout their entire lives. Williams even paid many of Reeve's medical bills after the accident.
The act of kindness/craziness of this great man still brings a smile on my face and then the sad reality strikes that he ended up killing himself is equally miserable and I shed a tear everytime I think of him.   World was better with you in it Robin, I hope you found peace. :-(
Life is *all* about the little things, which is what makes depression and stress so debilitating, because they overwhelmingly shift your attention to the big things.
If wearing doctors scrubs, while running around a doctors office doing a Russian accent, is a small act then I'd like to see a large one.  Top gent.
I’ll trade all of the Kardashians for him back.
Does anyone else miss him?
Robin was one of the most talented actors ever. Just the other day I randomly chose to watch Dead Poet’s Society with my gf(she hadn’t seen it). Once credits rolled she said it might be in her top 5 movies of all time. 
My next goal is to find all Robin Williams posts  before someone else posts this first
Rest In Peace to Christopher Reeve as well. 
He had a really good support system and family. A lot of his late stage problems seem to be related to the Parkinson's / Lewy Body Dementia issues. Not to be morbid or downtrodden on one of my favorite actors, I just think his issues we're outside of what we are currently capable of addressing whether through therapy or medicine.
This comment hit hard in the feels...i wish it were true :(
As things should be. 
Robin Williams was a legend 
the medical bills anecdote is denied by both people and has been widely reported to be false. (not to mention christopher reeve was pretty well off, so it doesn't make a lot of sense...)  [a washington post story on reeve's recovery. control+F for untrue](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99193-1996Jan30.html)  robin williams is wonderful and his friendship with christopher reeve is well documented and there's no reason to spread a false rumor when plenty of actual facts about their friendship are readily available.
He suffered from a form of dementia,: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-lewy-body-dementia-gripped-robin-williams1/
Remember, even though he killed himself.... it was to escape his pain. He was literally going crazy. And he chose to end it. :''(
This is profound.  I'm struggling with depression right now, and you're right, it's due to the big things. I need to stop taking the little things for granted. Your comment seriously just opened my eyes. Thank you very much.
You are trading pennies over a dolar
#karma
I think someone answered this before, but will it make me sad?   Edit: I think what I’m asking is, I haven’t watched it yet because I know it’ll make me sad due to his passing, but I was wondering how hard do they touch upon his death. Like do they mention it but then it’s all awesome stuff from him?
RIP to my grandma also
Yeah, my mom has lewy body dementia, it's one of the fastest moving dementias. People generally only live 5-7 years after diagnosis and even if he were still alive he would not be anything like the man he was. 4 years ago she was practicing medicine and 3 years ago no one suspected there was anything wrong with my mom, now she's a 140 pound toddler wearing adult diapers and hallucinating all the time. Sure in the very short term he could have raised awareness for the second most common dementia but in the long term..... I wouldn't wish this on anybody.
still cry in Hook....fml
I absolutely understand killing oneself over that.
I try to treat each day as a bunch of small things. Sort of like laying bricks, as long as I focus on doing a good job with each brick, I know the wall will look great eventually. Saying hi and spending extra time with the lady at the front desk is a brick. Taking my dog for a walk is a brick. Going for a run is at least one brick, maybe two. Then at the end of the day all my bricks stack up to something great that I can be proud of.
Robin is no longer with us so how could it not?
Yes, but it'll be happy and sad tears. Williams brought so much joy to so many people, but he was also human so it's not all laughs and joy.
Love you granny

# “I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anyone else to feel like that.”  ― [**Robin Williams**](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4421043.Robin_Williams) 
Why u love his granma? 
We are willing to push people to suicide or make them endure the worst extents of suffering because we aren't willing to take the responsibility of ending their pain in a humane way by our own hands.  When does it stops being life and becomes prison?  Imho we should ask ourselves the tough questions instead of shying away behind the sacredness of life.
This is the popular original/generic version of that quote which I really enjoy:  **”The loneliest people are the kindest. The saddest people smile the brightest. The most damaged people are the wisest. All because they do not wish to see anyone else suffer the way they do”**
As someone who was traumatized as young child, this is exactly how I feel but I've never been able to put that feeling into words. Thanks
Because she was a kind soul that deserves love
And she used to take her dentures out when performing mouth to south resuscitation.
"We used to live in a small town where everyone used to say hello to each other. My kids grew up saying ""hello"" and waving to all our neighbours and strangers we'd encounter on our walks. Every single person replied or waved back.   We moved to a busy city almost a year ago and people don't really talk to each other. My then 4 year old son asked me why people weren't willing to wave since it makes him feel warm inside when people tell him hello. I told him that they were just not used to it, and to keep going. Well a year later, in our neighbourhood people say hello to my kids, to me AND to others.   It's friendly, it's nice and it's motivating to interact with people around you. "
From the husband's point of view, his wife went from choosing a ham slice to a long embrace with an unknown child in the time it takes him to turn to the trolley and back. He tries to reconcile for a moment but then just nopes out of there
"My daughter is 3 and she hasn't stopped acting this same way.  She waves to everyone and says hi.  And if its kids, she literally believes they're all just meant to be her friends.  We had her at Ikea recently to pick out a big girl bed, and when we got inside there were some girls, probably 7 or 8 years old sitting on a bench playing with a fidget spinner.  She asked me if she could go sit with them and I said ""Well you'll have to ask them"".  She went up to them and said ""Can I sit with you and be friends?"" and they immediately were like ""Sure!"" and they ran and grabbed her one of those Ikea papers and a small pencil.  The 3 of them sat and drew and scribbled together for about 5 or 10 minutes and it was so sweet.    Its a shame that kind of mentality doesn't stick with most people into their later years."
I feel like that lady needed that hug more than the child did
30 year old man chiming in. This brings tears to my eyes. I think it's a few things: I live in Chicago and if anyone waves or smiles at you...you default to assuming they are going to ask you for money or want something in return. It's pretty sad that random acts of kindness are received with a significant amount of caution. Even children here are doing the bidding of their parents for ulterior motives/financial scams. I miss genuine people who want to be a bright spot in your day. I can remember asking people how they are and meaning it. I feel like this city, hell the world we live in, has lost sight of pure kindness and it just sucks the joy out of everyone. Hope everyone reading this has a great day and tries to do something nice just for the hell of it. 
that 30 second hug is the most adorable thing ever haha
If life has taught me anything it's that there are so many more good people in the world than there are bad.  
This has to be one of the cutest things I have ever seen. 
Awww, that's nice. Must be nice to be a woman and not have your motives questioned when hugging children that arent yours.
Why does everyone have something broken in this store... Probably a fight club in the back
you are changing the world at your personal level and I appreciate that. 
"I'm from Kansas and often on the highway every single car you find will give you the classic ""lift your hand slightly off the wheel"" wave because sometimes you can go hours without seeing another car and it gets lonely"
"I've lived in a city my whole life and my default setting when walking around is ""Fuck off out of my way, i'm trying to get shit done"" but if a kid waved at me and said hello, i'd say hello and wave back.   If an adult waved and said hello i'd have my guard up thinking they were going to try sell me something.   "
My fiance and I just bought a house, and our new neighborhood is so friendly! If I'm sitting on the front porch crocheting or reading or whatnot, people walking by will smile, wave, say hi, introduce themselves... It's so nice! 
"""42 years and she can't focus on my needs for 30 seconds"" "
And from my point of view the Jedi are evil
Safe to say that made Grandma's day?
My daughter was like that.  Then we moved somewhere where the kids were catty and played friends against each other.  She's not like that any more.
>Its a shame that kind of mentality doesn't stick with most people into their later years.  Yeah, due to years of rejection. Everyone wants to say hi to a cute little kid. Nobody wants to say Hi to a hairy obese neckbeard with a lazy eye and a greasy forehead. 
How can it when people take advantage of kids like this! I was like this, thought everyone who smiled at me was a friend, and now I have a thick shell around me.
Hello 🖐
That hug made her day. I imagine she's raised her babies into adults, and that hug took her back to fond memories of her own at that age.  Biggest winner in the video.
I imagine there are a great many adults in this world that need a hug more than most children do...the only solution of course is hugs for all!
tbf the guy with a broken leg probably would lose his house if he didn't show up to work
Visit the south man, Oklahoma and Texas. Almost everyone will hold the door for each other, say hello, or wave. Just be prepared though, NO ONE is in a hurry in small towns, if you stop to talk to someone make sure you have an extra at least 5 minutes. 
This is adorable xD
Yeh i like how the lady didn't let go until the girl did. 
This exactly.  Most people are good, giving, kind, and empathetic.  They have families and children and pets.  Everyone has had a childhood.  Picturing everyone as once being a child, where the world was new and innocence wasn't lost, helps me to be kind.  Stay gold, ponyboy.
I think this is the ONLY way to effectively change the world. 
I'm from Jersey we do the same thing except we use our middle finger and you might hit traffic trying to pull out of your driveway xD
I've lived in a neighborhood like that for 10 years. While I appreciate and love my neighbors, sometimes I just want to get out of my house without talking to somebody. There's always someone outside, watering their flowers or playing with their dogs or coming back from work. It gets annoying, especially when you're in a hurry.  /Debbie Downer
*Where's the liquor aisle*
Well, then you are lost!
Definitely! This post just made me miss my grandma so bad. She gave great hugs like that. We only got to see her twice a year because we lived so far but when we did and we crunched down the gravel road that led to her tiny little two bedroom house, she would jump up and down and clap her hands she was so excited.   Baby donuts and popcorn and king of the hill on the rock pile and late night Dominoes games which she would always win. Then all four of us boys would fall asleep on the living room floor, the air was so hot but we didn't care. Then we'd all load up the minivan but she'd hug us so tight and say I don't want to ever let you go.   I miss you nanny... 
Ugh it only takes one bad apple to ruin a bunch. 
I'm not saying to fix your lazy eye by any means, but taking a little extra care of yourself such as a fresh haircut, a better diet to get rid of the greasy forehead or even just a smile do wonders on making yourself more approachable to others (and your self-esteem). It's a two-way street my friend. Good luck! 
Too true unfortunately. My wife and I know we're going to have to balance our kids' friendly nature with caution. It will suck to have to explain to her not everyone wants to be your friend.
That woman totally mothered.   Makes me want kids now. Damn it. 
She probably made that lady's week. 
You're so positive, /u/HopeYouDieSoon :) 
Smalltalk with people you barely know is introvert hell.
Is this a viewing of my Future?  Cause its definitely a viewing of my past.
If this is a Sam's Club (and it sure as hell looks like it) it would be to the right a couple aisles and behind the perspective of this camera shot.
Shitapples
Lol. Oh, I wasn't talking about me. I was just giving an example. 
I didn't want kids for years. Finally had a son at 28 - first three months are awful because of sleep deprivation, but other than that it's so much love. Occasional moment of crap, but that's just life. 95% cute and joy, 5% being really angry and frustrated and trying to hide it lol
That's his alterego
It is common for people on Reddit with scary names to say positive and nice things a lot.
Looks like Costco to me
The shitapple doesn't fall far from the shittree
Dude. Just get yourself together. You're disgusting.
"So this!!! For three months I was like ""who in their right mind would CHOOSE to do this?? It's horrible and I hate it!"" Now, a full 8 months in and it rocks. "
Finally? 28?
so a week?
It's his bright secret.
Isn't it great? It really gives you hope for humanity.
Do you feel that? The way the shit clings to the air randy?
Man, he's in such denial.
Shit storm is coming, Randy.

This actually helped me. I just got back in the gym tonight after a several yeah break. I have ptsd and am pretty over life and could only do 15 mins of arms and chest before failure. It's not where I used to be, but it's a start. Consistency is key.   Love you, Arnold. 
Is this legit? 
Gosh, every time I see or hear anything about this man it’s always so wholesome. The best fight in the world would be the The Rock vs. Arnold. Just beating the living shit out of each other while they donate to charities and compliment each other.   Edit: a lot of people saying Arnie has a bad past. I’ll admit I haven’t looked into it and I’m pretty young. Since I’ve seen him around  in the news he seems kind hearted. Not one of us is perfect. He seems to be willing to change who he was and should still get credit for being a good person.  
Your depression has been terminated.
This is what we all need to hear sometimes
I love it when people use their position of power and influence for building people up. Even though I logically know otherwise, it seems so much more true when he says it.
I read that in his voice
/r/terminatorsbeingbros  https://imgur.com/gallery/88BO1
When someone who has done it all can relate to the time before he/she took their step one. 
Good job!! I’m proud of you. Keep at it, keep showing up. Every session doesn’t have to be perfect, done is good. 
"You could only do 15 mins of arms and chest before ""failure."" that's not failure! You succeeded at 15 mins of arms and chests. And that's something to hold onto and be proud of. "
You just did the hardest part of a workout which is breaking the streak of not working out.  Job well done.  Keep making us proud, even 15 minutes at a time. 
Yes sir 
Arnold is a perfect example of how different stages of our lives demand a different version of ourselves.   He’s really aged into this whole “old man wisdom” thing that he’s got going on quite nicely.
Hasta la vista, anxiety.
“I’ll be back”  — clinical depression 
r/subsyoufellfor
"This isn't just something that you go through before you take your first step.  This is something *everyone* can go through. Even people we admire and think of as invincible. Arnie isn't remembering the times ""before he was perfect."" Going through hard times isn't a sign that you are weak or that you haven't made it yet.  It's just a sign that you are human. Show yourself the same kindness that you would show to Arnie. Because we are all worth it. At all phases of life. "
Thank you Peenerwiener, it means a lot to me.
Haha that’s a workout term. But I’m sure the sentiment is entirely appreciated
Is this Hassan?
Agreed. I think a lot of people are unaware of how cocky and egomaniacal he was earlier in his career, but truthfully (and somewhat in his defense) he had every reason to be. He was an unseen force who set a new standard for bodybuilding around the world. Besides, at times he phrased it in such ways that it was hard to differentiate between what was cocky, and what was just straight-up, unblinking confidence in himself.  If you watch Pumping Iron, you catch a glimpse of that competitive streak and how he treats his competition, most notably Lou Ferrigno. But it's no different than that of Phil Heath today, who might also be just about as nice to fans and rewarding to the community as any bodybuilder.  
He didn't deny it, and he bought a house for her to raise her child in. Apparently he was unaware that it was his child for a long time; the maid never told *him* .   He expressed it as his greatest regret in an AMA a few years ago. He cheated on his wife, but just because of that doesn't mean he should be forever ostracized for trying to say nice things and spread positivity. 
Do I dare press that link? Or is it a clever ruse to get me to press the link? Will I fall for the trap laid so clearly in front of me? Or will I be rewarded in my pursuit of knowledge?   This is truly the Schrödinger’s cat of all subreddit links I’ve ever come across
Can’t wait till Kanye gets that old man wisdom 
Spitting blunt wisdom at a child. Dad goals. 
To be fair, right after that he gives into her and gives her one too.
Great wisdom but can't help but feel that the lack of shadow on the final image text is /r/mildlyinfuriating/
"This is the same man who said ""The only thing keeping me from fucking animals is because someone told me not to. It would take me 10 minutes after being the last man on earth before I starting fucking monkeys and that's not even long enough to be sure you're the last one."""
I don't know who those girls are that play his kids but there is not an ounce of kid awkwardness disney channel acting coming from them.  Weirdly good at what they do.
This is just bourgeois propaganda to keep the proletariat down. You should always look in your neighbors bowl to make sure they're not hoarding wealth that rightfully belongs to the people. 
I did not expect a Louis CK quote to be so inspiring
Going to see him tonight. Finally the day has come.
This is why I love Louis CK. He talks to people like adults.
"My only question is how are you gonna tell someone who is starving not to look at someone elses ""bowl"""
To be fair he REALLY had a hard time getting his point across, and in the end gave up cause she wasn't getting it.    That's my favorite thing about that show. The best moments aren't some grand speech, they're just people trying to talk to one another. And half the time those moments affect the viewer more than the characters in the show.
Yes, that's because the show is a comedy and that sort of irony is what makes it funny. Doesn't make the quote any less valuable or take away from its meaning. 
"It is to be fair. It's always bothered me when parents allow something that favors one child over another, and when the latter complains, they say ""life's not fair, learn to live with it."" Life isn't fair, but YOU should ALWAYS try to be fair. Sure, there's a lot that humans have no control over. Mass natural disasters are unfair, and we have to live (or die...) with that. But when manmade systems are unfair, it's almost always intentional, and in favor of a select few, and THAT is bullshit and is not something you should teach your children to be okay with. Children should be taught to fight unfairness and injustice, not to accept it as the status quo."
The meme originally didn't include the last frame.
The fact that he says admits to such horribly disgusting things (he also says he put peanut butter on his balls to make his dog lick them) makes me feel like he doesn't say these strangely motivating things to feel self-righteous and elitist. He says them because he simply believes in them. 
You mean a comedian?
I think it's the style of show they are acting in. Disney channel is known for their peppy, stay positive, quirky characters, they don't represent lifelike people. Louie is nothing like that. Not to say these girls aren't talented, but I'm curious how Disney actors could pull off a similar role. Unless I'm missing the mark of what you're trying to say.
"""“I’m bored’ is a useless thing to say. I mean, you live in a great, big, vast world that you’ve seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless; it goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that you’re alive is amazing, so you don’t get to say ‘I’m bored.” - Louis C.K."" - Michael Scott"
"Studies also show that speaking to a child as an adult, or having them around adult conversations, not making them sit at the ""kiddy table"" or having baby talk to them, will help them understand the world in a more adult and mature way.   [source, can't find the exact line but its an amazing podcast episode](http://www.stufftoblowyourmind.com/podcasts/only-child-syndrome.htm)"
but he's talking to his daughter, not to someone who is starving
"I'm pretty sure, according to the quote, that's when other people are supposed to look at her bowl and go ""hey, she doesn't have enough""."
Everyone's ignoring the first part. Looking in someone else's bowl and seeing they have more than you doesn't do any good because life isn't fair. It's a separate lesson than the second part about charity.
I think the fact that she ended up getting what she wanted and Louis gave up on giving his poignant life lesson and *that* metaphor is what actually makes Louis CK great.
It reminde me to my favorites Albert Einstein  Quotes  [Quote 1](http://imagus.co/img/39h)  [Quote 2](http://imagus.co/img/39j)  [Quote 3](http://imagus.co/img/39i)
i think he says them because he's a comedian and it makes people laugh
AUTOMATED
It makes perfect sense. Younger people are underestimated.
"My Dad was like this to me as a kid and I can't thank him enough for it. I'm not saying I'm super smart or wise or anything, but I feel like him just telling me stuff straight was really good preparation for the world.  I remember really vividly this one time I (when I must've been like 4-5) asked him how to spell ""the"". I'd been used to teachers and other adults telling me stuff phonetically - ""tuh"" ""huh"" ""eh"" (I guess those might differ, depending on your accent). But he just told me ""T-H-E"". I really remember it throwing me off for a sec, thinking ""I can't understand that, we haven't gotten to learning it properly yet, why doesn't he tell me like all kids get told?"". Then I thought about it, and realised that I understood, and then I never forgot how to spell it. I've thought on that before, and I can see it in how he told me other things too. He used to walk me to school and I'd ask him difficult, broad questions like a kid would, and he'd just reply like I was an adult. I think those walks really helped shape me as an intellectual individual. I'm the first person in my family to go to college. Damn, I should phone home soon."
Maybe the baby talk is why my dog never reached his full potential.

He's one of the few comedians who manages to say extremely offensive things without actually being offensive and mean-spirited because of his ability to show his audience that he doesn't think of himself as superior to those he's insulting.

Bilingualism is a good thing. It slows development in both languages initially if not done properly, but bilingual students overall have better command of language and better outcomes learning a 3rd language.

Good one bro, always joking around
COMMUNISM
It's spelled 'murica.   You uncultured swine.
Start with about 30 minutes of unnecessary sex scenes, then move on to a love triangle, throw in a breast cancer scare, somebody has to die in the end, and, if you can, include a random kid who may or may not need your help to get off drugs 
in all seriousness, i saw this tweet and ended up cleaning my entire room
Whatever you might say about Tommy Wiseau you can't deny that he's unbelievably motivated. He's inspiring in his one-mindedness if nothing else. 
Someone needs to tell Tommy you can't stop at the first draft. 
it's so perfect it hurts
Oh hi mahk
The guy gets a lot of shit for his movie, but he fucking took his shot.  That is what I love about the guy.  It's like Kevin Smith said about having only ONE life and how you'd have to be crazy to NOT take a shot at your dream.  This guy didn't give a fuck if he got it bad.  He just fucking wanted it.  Period.
You can only grow. Might as jump head first into anything new 
Hopefully you will write the most infamous movie of all time. 
He's right, he did what he loved regardless of whether or not it turned out well. You have to try and do what makes you happy.
The corollary: Every dead body on Everest was one a highly motivated person.  In all fairness, if Wiseau didn't hijack that plane and use the funds to make a movie, regardless of how bad it was, he'd just be some no-name today.
I did not start, I did not. Oh, hi Mark.  Edit: after careful reconsideration “I did naht staht, I did naht. Oh, hi Mahk.”
Dude, you forgot the football scenes! You need those, they're meant to make them down to earth.
"You joke, but you know what he did?  He finished a screenplay. Coffee shops across the world are filled with tortured ""writers"" waiting for INSPIRATION TO STRIKE.  Know what Wiseau did? He wrote it. So he's uniquely qualified to give exactly this piece of advice."
Have the random kid hit on your fiance and jump in the bed when you're about to have sex with your fiance. 
It's fun to make fun, but no matter how (charmingly) bad the movie may be, there's a lot to be said for Tommy's tenacity and force of will, which have brought him the success he desired.  I hope everyone in this subreddit is tenacious enough to find the success they seek. Then in 15 years' time we'll be able to enjoy salty comments about what we've succeeded on from whomever your analog on reddit is 15 years hence. :D
ah-ha-ha, what a story, Ballsinmymouthjohn.
*Jordan Peterson wipes away a tear*
He worked his way from selling cheap toys in Europe to being Portrayed in one of the best movies of 2017.
People told him he couldn't do it. More people told him he probably *shouldn't* do it.   But he did it anyways!
Wiseau word
Tommy was seriously considering making Johnny a vampire for the final scene, but he was talked out of it.  Edit: My bad guys, it was supposed to be an extension of the Chris R. fight scene where the big vampiric reveal was made. Let's all give  u/DarryLarrel a big round of applause though for his hard work to recreate what that scene could have been like.  Sauce to the article I read about it:   https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/12/tommy-wiseau-the-room-director-facts/#ampshare=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/12/tommy-wiseau-the-room-director-facts
Is it tearing you apart? 
Hai*
In fairness, he was *loaded* before he wrote The Room (and no one's really sure how he got that way). Terrible scripts are written every day. They never see the light of day because no one's willing to throw $6m at them. Even Howard Hughes knew to hire individuals with talent to make his movies.  Having read The Disaster Artist and other accounts, I honestly do not admire the guy one bit. He is an *asshole* who will screw you the hell over if he can't have his way with you. When I watch The Room, I'm not laughing with him. I'm laughing AT him.
Also, maybe be a vampire.
i went to a midnight showing of this. why do we throw spoons?
Oh hi Mark
Serious question, why were they dressed in Tuxedos that one scene? It wasn’t the wedding yet. It wasn’t the party. Were they just fitting them? WHY WERE THEY WEARING TUXEDOS 
Wiseau has done more than 99.9% of people in film.  As easy as it is to make fun of him, the man has fucking DONE something.
*Future Wife
So anyways how's your sex life?
He loves America so much that he celebrates Thanksgiving Month, where he eats a turkey dinner all of November. If anything, he is an argument for looser immigration policies. 
And they were right.
... the movie that could have been.
He could’ve had a standard bullet in the gun, with the suicide attempt being a stunt to make Lisa regret tearing him apart. He wouldn’t die though, because the bullet wasn’t silver. He’d reveal he was still alive while Lisa was sobbing over his dead body.   Unfortunately, Mark knew Tommy’s secret and replaced the bullet with a silver one he got from the florist- the flower shop was a front for Vietnamese organized crime... she had connections, and she was tired of Tommy waltzing in like he owned the place. He parked illegally on the street out front and she didn’t trust the accent. She was happy to oblige Mark’s odd request.   Anyways, Tommy had asked Mark about his sex life for the last time, and knew Tommy was coming unhinged and was desperate enough to keep Lisa by shooting himself for attention.   Oh  wait. I’m thinking of werewolves aren’t I. Nevermind. 
*throws football*
*We’ll see*
I'm thinking... Gargoyles.
In a nutshell someone mentioned that the set looked empty so Tommy sent someone to buy a bunch of stuff to put around the set. When they arrived Tommy didn't want to take the time to change the pictures in the photo frames which had pictures of spoons. When you see the spoon, yell spoon and toss a handful
There's framed photos of spoons in the movie.  
How’s your sex life?
I love how you can literally just write oh hi Mark anywhere now and be guaranteed about 20 upvotes
It was after 5, whatre they farmers?
In the DVD special features there is an interview with Tommy and the interviewer asked him that exact question.  This was his answer:   >People should realize that playing football, without any gear and a special big huge field, it's fun!  So you can play football in tuxedos, you can play three feet apart, the idea is to have fun.  So I would recommend to anyone to try it! 
I WAS GONNA SAY THAT BUT I SAW YOUR REPLY  I HATE YOU    YOU'RE TEARING ME APART!
... but he's from New Orleans
That's part of the mystery that makes us love Tommy Wisseau.   Where's he from? The Big Easy! How old is he? He's your age! Where did he get the money? Don't worry about That!  So, anyway, how's your sex life?
They were so right, that they then became wrong
Ha ha ha what a story Randolf!
iirc They bought out the window display at a thrift store so it looked like a house that was not ever meant for people to live in
hahah thats a good story mark 
Oh hai Mark
Why? WHY?!
"And He's ""your age"""
Not sure if joke I'm not getting but he's confirmed he's from Europe.   The internet is pretty adamant he's Polish.
Hah ha ha... So how is your sex life?  You're tearing me apart Lisa!!!!
Happy birthday
In 'The Disaster Artist' he keeps telling people he's from New Orleans.
Oh hi Mark

This is Raymond Burns. After spending time on the other side of the law he decided to change his life by first earning an associate degree, then a bachelor’s degree from Florida Atlantic University.   He had his sights set on going higher in his education and attended Nova Southeastern University’s Shepard Broad College of Law, where he earned his law degree.  Burns already is putting that law degree to good use and has been working at the Palm Beach County Public Defender’s Office since October.
You can be a licensed attorney with a felony? 
The Florida Man story we all wish for.
Shout out to the Sports Authority manager who encouraged him. Sometimes that's all it takes.  😊 
What a great story to start 2019
I was thinking he made manager or something but becoming a lawyer! Amazing. 
[He is now working in the public defender's office](https://www.ajc.com/news/national/from-convict-lawyer-man-has-new-lease-life/gWR4y7Ic3qpINcLvqHErtL/)
I thought that was Ted Cruz for a second lol
Great story about getting a second chance.  Makes regret how our  “zero tolerance” mentality in the government and military recklessly “discards” good people far too often...  Good for Raymond.
Florida Man: The Redemption 
I was about ready to quit college while I was working at a grocery store. My manager threatened to fire me if I quit. I'm glad he did that. I got my dream job after getting my bachelors
He’s the Florida Man who defends all of the Florida Men we read about.
"Politicians running on zero tolerance ""tough on crime"" platforms get elected.  ""My opponent's policies let this dangerous person out of jail"" is a great way to get elected.  The government is a symptom of the problem.  Most people in jail have kids outside. (1.2 children per prisoner in the US). One of the strongest predictors of going to prison in your life is having had an incarcerated parent.  The whole system is messed up and we keep plugging holes in the dam instead of diverting the river."
Being Albert Einstein 
From AJC:  “Burns story started when he was released from prison after serving time for an undisclosed crime.”  I’m guessing he wants to his past behind him.
It can't have been too serious or the state wouldn't license him to practice law.
Hell, you can commit dozens of felonies and still be the President.
I'm a convicted felon who spent the majority of my 20's incarcerated.   When I got out I did complete my bachelor's, but I steered away from any occupation that required professional licensing for fear of getting denied.   
Why not jump straight to the bowels of humanity and visit /r/iamatotalpieceofshit?  (Also, why are we ruining this uplifting post?)
">. ""My opponent's policies let this dangerous person out of jail"" is a great way to get elected.  It is, because you don't rehabilitate. When the prisons earn money with prisoners, they don't give a shit. And they will lobby for that shit. Making for profit prisons illegal would be the first step to stop that shit. "

Its by Alejandro Jodorowsky, original quote is a bit different   > “Birds born in a cage think flying is an illness.
"""Be sure to drink your Ovaltine."""
Ehh, a misquote.   Birds born in a cage think flying is an illness. -Alejandro Jodorowsky  Or maybe anonymous gets credit for the variation?
A guy I went to college with decided to live his life completely off the grid. Literally.   I mean, this guy was postgrad at a super prestigious institution in a non-bullshit degree track, basically went full Kaczynski. Earns a modest living as a technical writer. He pays his own way but lives super lean.   Any given day, he's sleeping in a tent, usually in different locations.   In addition to being one of the smartest guys I've ever met, he is far and away the freest man I know in spite of being referred to as a bum, vagrant, vagabond and hobo by people who don't have available to them a tiny fraction of the freedom he has.   We're all born in a cage.   A tiny few break free.   We mock and deride them.   We're the idiots. Not them.   Most of us have no idea what 'freedom' even is. When you get a few passport stamps and see it, it changes you. 
Giraffes born on boats think that solid ground is a myth. 
Freedom is  eing able to choose your cage
That's a great quote.
Plato's Cave
"One of the greatest directors I have ever known. For anybody who does not know About his works…  ""The holy mountain""  I am not an advocate of drugs or psychedelia… Mostly because my life and profession rely on sobriety from illegal substances  but if I took a very extensive and enduring the vacation…  -edit rip inbox lol"
"Considering how common the sentiment is, you'd be more accurate in saying ""Jodorowsky said something similar once."" I'm not entirely convinced that this is a derivative of his words, despite the shared idea.  I mean, if it's a differently worded quote, in a different language, as far removed from Jodorowsky's realm of influence as possible... it's probably not Jodorowsky's; we might as well let this anonymous spray painter take credit for the words...  Who knows, maybe they thought they were original for a fleeting moment, as they let the paint loose against the wall, smiled at the ideas they were conveying, reveled in the silent rebellion against the oppressive world around them... only to find yet another corpse of a western intellectual squatting on the sentence.  How delightfully demotivating."
Awww, weak, she wasn't even hardcore enough to declaim the lady's sinning.
Same here. God, I hated going to church with all the casting out of demons, sacred oil rub downs, screaming in tongues and wailing women.

That's not a very good example. Guy is doing what he wants, good for him. But that's not something everyone aspires for. Feeling trapped is an entirely different issue than the one the quote is addressing.
"""Paying someone less than they produce""  That's Capitalism, bud."
They don't church 'em like they used to, I reckon.

Yeah his church seems like my Friday night
Been sober for six months. I recently became aware, for the first time since I started drinking, why it was that I enjoyed drinking myself numb. Too many thoughts rushing through my mind. Constant. Some good. Mostly worried. I used to enjoy the sedation sensation that drinking would create. But now, after these 6 months,  I could never go back. I enjoy feeling again. I enjoy the anxiety. I enjoy the doubt as part of the process that comes with overcoming ones fears. I want to feel connected again. To myself. To society. 
Now that I look back on my years of hard partying, I regret the lack of sacred oil rubdowns. I think that's what we were really missing out on.  Don't be afraid to rubdown your friends, kids. 
Finally, my lifestyle is validated by cool people. Lol
Canceling work to browse reddit is ok.
Eh, canceling plans just to read is pretty rude. How about just not making the plans in the first place? Lol. Making plans is a two way street
For people who stay in too much, going out instead of staying in could constitute self-improvement.
cancelling plans isn't cool. how about turning down plans instead?
I'd be a little upset if someone cancelled plans on me to go read a book. It'd have to be a really good book...
Canceling plans to read is not cool. We both agreed to the plan and my time is just as valuable to me as yours is to you. You have every right to do that but I have every right to think you're rude asf and not invite you to stuff. Declining invitations so you can read is fine.
Wasn't this made by the fake chance impersonator? lmao
"""Cool"" people don't exist, we're all a fucked up mixture of good and bad human beings. You do you"
It doesn't say anything about cancelling plans to lay on the couch watching YouTube and buying dumb shit on Amazon, so I guess I'm just an asshole.
If it makes you feel better this def isn’t Chances twitter account. So it’s more like your lifestyle is getting validated by a nobody.
I was going to write a novel but I’m going to cancel and jerk off. Am I doing this right?
I agree, don’t make them in the first place just to cancel. There’s nothing wrong with having plans. A weird set of advice.

I would go so far as to say with that same line of thinking, good and bad people don't exist, just people doing different things with different ideas and experiences.
Yes. You can't deny your body's will.
Yeah. It’s obvious what the message is supposed to be. Just sucks the first line is kind of stupid.   “Hey, you ready to go your sisters wedding?”   “Nah. Danielle Steele has a lot of books and I don’t know if I’ll be able to finish them if I go.”  /s
Ehhh I think murder & rape make someone pretty bad personally but you do you
Two weeks into quitting. This post is great to see.   Good job on a decade.   Edit: thanks for the words of encouragement, everyone. Here’s to everyone staying quit!
Fuck yeah dude. That’s a whole truck. Happy cake day. 
Gooooood job mate.   Almost on the 10 year mark myself.   In Canada. 15/pack. Pack/day. 10 years. That’s like 54K. Altho they weren’t 15/pack back then. Prolly 45k easy. Lost packs. Bummed darts. I hear they’re closer to 18/pack now too. When I quit 13 was average.   Happy mother fucking cake day too! 🎂🍰🎉  And for sure - you’ve saved way more than 30k. The other expenses that go with smoking. The lower value of your cars, medical bills in the future. Social damage. It’s not even measurable. 
I'm 20, been smoking solidly since i was 15, first picked em up at 14 though. I'm just now coming to terms with the fact I have to quit. I've started getting a nasty cough. It's interfering with my weight loss journey (26kg so far). But most of all the money is whats at the back of my mind everytime I light up. But at the end of the day, I don't know if i can do it, I genuinely love smoking.  This is encouraging though, so thankyou and especially well done. 
One day imma have to calculate how much I’ve spent on bud. That is gonna be a painful day 
First two to three weeks were definitely the hardest. Mostly getting out of the routine of smoking.  You're almost out of the hard part keep going!   Edit for the questions on which app: [Quitter (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quitter/id284944935?mt=8)
You've made it buddy, if you can make it three days you can make it the rest of your life. It has been five years for me and I don't even think about them anymore.
Actually the money did switch over to a truck payment!
Thanks grats to you as well!  The amount is actually more since the price per pack goes up every year.  🎉
When you stop, you'll be astonished at how much smokers smell.   I tried to be a polite smoker snd used gum and  hand sanitizer a lot but it probably did nothing.   A few weeks in after switching to an evapor stick and I can smell other smokers strong.   I got on an elevator with a suit and tie businessman who extinguished their cigarette all the way outside of the building but when he left the elevator it still smelled of cigarettes.   I'm wondering about all the potential social situations I sullied with my smokes. 
Yeah, I remember I used to have vivid dreams about smoking every single night for something like 6 months after I quit. Man, those first 3 months were the toughest though, I'd get upset for no reason due to what must've been hormonal imbalances.
The hardest part for me was the 6-7 month mark. The high from knowing you quit smoking has past. People no longer accept the I quit smoking as an excuse for momentary anger from needing a fix.  You have a few drinks with friends and you think one cig won't hurt you've quit for 6 months already.   The first few weeks are hard. 6 months is the hardest. I don't know how hard it gets after that because I picked it back up after 8. 
This should not be the first I’m hearing of this person
"She was recorded at her trial as saying, ""Somebody, after all, had to make a start. What we wrote and said is also believed by many others. They just don't dare express themselves as we did."""
"""Such a fine sunny day, and I have to go.""  Absolute. Fucking. Hero."
It’s easy to be brave when there are no real consequences, but this woman knew the most likely outcome of her actions and didn’t back down - she sacrificed her life for the greater good, what a warrior.
A full movie about her and the White Rose movement is on youtube, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baRvF6ZBK18
For those interested, look up Sophie Scholl and the White Rose. She and her brother and others created anti-Nazi pamphlets to spread the word about what was happening. They risked their lives to get information out there, truly brave. 
"If you find stories like this inspirational, you'd like Adolfo Kaminsky. He's estimated to have saved 14,000 lives forging identity documents for Jews during WWII. He was 18 years old at the time.

It wasn’t possible. I had to stay awake as long as possible. Fight against sleep. The math was simple. In one hour, I made 30 fake documents. If I slept for one hour, 30 people would die.

I hope this doesnt sound fucked up but god damn her hair is wicked cool
Holy mother of Mary that's powerful 
I have a German daily phrase calendar and today, instead of a phrase, it has a paragraph biography about this woman. I'd never heard of her before I read it, and now I came across this. Kinda weird but cool.
Sophie Scholl, her brother Hans Scholl, the students Alexander Schmorell, Christoph Probst, Willi Graf and the professor Kurt Huber were the brave people who first stood against Hitler and the NS regime. Everyday I'm walking past their memorial at our university, where they first took action. And it hits me hard everytime, how they died so young yet without regret, fighting for what was right. They were real heroes.
There is a pretty kick ass movie about her and the White Rose organization in Nazi Germany. It's in German, but has subtitles. 
Thank you for posting this. It opened a whole new awareness for me.
What a badass
It seems like the youth are politically invested and more willing to take an action throughout history
if you think this sort of thing has any resemblance to current US politics, you are truly misguided and delusional
It's easy to act brave when a mob is behind you.   True courage is a lonely dangerous road. 
This is the type of history we need to be hearing *in addition* to the Nazi crimes against humanity. People too often forget that the first country the Nazis took over was Germany itself. Not everyone agreed. 
No joke. Now I gotta research more than just a picture on Reddit of course. I feel a wiki-blackhole happening soon...
crazy how unknown they are outside of Germany. here there are streets named after them in every major city
I'm surprised that she got a trial. Is there a reason she got to speak? Nazis weren't really into listening to people state their case.
"This reminds me of Florida shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez's [remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/17/us/florida-student-emma-gonzalez-speech/index.html) a few days ago: ""But instead we are up here standing together because if all our government and President can do is send thoughts and prayers, then it's time for victims to be the change that we need to see.""  The mentality of 'if no one else will, I will' is very powerful and seems to resonate with young people."
That line suddenly reminded me of the song [Heretic Pride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ6O7Jk4MXs)
"""In war 10 men shouldnt be there, 80 are targets, 9 are soldiers, and 1 is a warrior."" (paraphrased)  She was a warrior."
How the fuck did I not know about this!!  THNAK YOU FELLOW REDDIT PERSON!
They *lost* their lives. I'm sure you know that but saying risked makes it sound like it worked out ok, it didn't.
This is such an incredible documentary, he is a true hero. I’m so glad you posted this, I hope more people watch it.
 Her hairstyle is surprisingly modern. Not hard to see her as the kids protesting today. 
And, impressive that she spoke English.
It’s called _Sophie Scholl_. Oscar nominee.  There is great dialog in this movie between her and her interrogator. Her brother finishes his day in court perfectly.  Something like; “you will soon stand where I am and be judged accordingly.”
youth typically have a lot less to lose and a ton more to gain
"It's not Hitler's rise to power that interest me the most...It's the people that saw it coming and did nothing to stop it.   To often people stand idly by and say ""well that's not my job"" or ""maybe someone should do something"". Well that someone is you most of the time...."
Haven’t you read a US history textbook? Everyone in Germany and Japan was evil during the 40’s! /s
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl  Start here friend :)
"She was given a ""trial,"" as in she wasn't allowed to defend herself, but was allowed a brief statement, and then was found guilty. She was executed only a few hours later in the same day. Still better than what the Nazis had done to previous traitors, but still not even close to justice."
The Nazis didn't just randomly kill people. First they went through the procedures, detailing exactly which people they should randomly kill. For example you'd get a trial but it's guaranteed you die - unless you're really good friends with some higher ups in the party. Watch Schindler's list.  Edit: before I have to write this another 10 times, randomly killing people is not as evil as planned, systematic genocide and that was what for example the Einsatzgruppen did. The killing, terror and fear was systematic.
"It's called a ""show trial"" an age-old tactic of tyrants"
Funny, looking at the image before checking comments I was thinking that if she spoke up today certain people would want to discount her just because of her haircut.   Interesting similarity.
(Out of 100) Just heard this on a JRE podcast today, weird how this happens
Very true, good point!! 
hmm..I think the extra years of life is a pretty big thing to lose.
*The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.* - Edmund Burke 
The problem is that while these things are going on, in your head a little voice tells you “I’m sure it’s alright. Maybe the people arrested really did commit a crime. Maybe it is all just a big mistake. Surely such a thing won’t happen to me! I am doing nothing wrong.”   The German government didn’t one day just come out and say “We are killing all the opposition now!” It’s this strange unreal turn of events that is so unlike what you imagine could happen, that hardly any person understands the gravity of the situation until it’s much too late.
And in that trial they hoped you give names of others
It's true what is it with people discrediting others cause they don't have a feminine haircut. It's not like hair is telling us how to think.

*And I am reminded on this holy day of the sad story of Kitty Genovese. As you all may remember, long time ago almost 30 years ago. This poor soul cried out for help time and time again, but no person answered her calls. Though many saw, no one so much as called the police. They all just watched as Kitty was being stabbed to death in broad daylight. They watched as her assailant walked away. Now, we must all fear evil men. But, there is another kind of evil which we must fear most … and that is the indifference of good men!* - Boondock Saints 
And it was to give the killing an appearance of legitimacy.
its not the haircut, thats just the easiest thing to target her for. if it wasnt her hair it wold be something else. but the general point is discrediting her
Back when I served, there was a young man who was drafted into the Army. He behaved very oddly and was sent for psychiatric evaluation. The military psychiatrist discovered that the recruit had neither eaten not slept in two weeks (thus the odd behavior), and recommended that the young man be discharged. If he is that terrified of military service, the psychiatrist stated, there is no way he would survive basic training. The unit commander disagreed and kept the young man on, only to eventually allow him to be discharged when his behavior deteriorated. The recruit made it home, only to immolate himself (pour gasoline over and set himself alight) within a day of making it back home.  Some people shouldn't be there.
Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.   -Dr. Seuss, The Lorax
> Kitty Genovese  FYI, many of the facts usually trotted out about the case are in doubt.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese#Accuracy_of_original_reports  > While there was no question that the attack occurred, and that some neighbors ignored cries for help, the portrayal of 38 witnesses as fully aware and unresponsive was erroneous. The article grossly exaggerated the number of witnesses and what they had perceived. None saw the attack in its entirety. Only a few had glimpsed parts of it, or recognized the cries for help. Many thought they had heard lovers or drunks quarreling. There were two attacks, not three. And afterward, two people did call the police. A 70-year-old woman ventured out and cradled the dying victim in her arms until they arrived. Ms. Genovese died on the way to a hospital.
Fascism always hides behind a facade of legitimacy. Evil perpetuates itself in power and authority.

Bob always wanted to empower his viewers and remind them that art is for everyone. [Here is the finished work.](https://i.imgur.com/FyhzBeH.png)
Can we start a religion based on the preachings of Bob Ross and Mr. Rogers? 
Yea!! Take that colour blind guy, lazy bastard
I knew a guy in high school who was red/green colorblind (ironically, though spelled differently, his last name was pronounced like “rainbow”). We were in Art III together, and he excelled. One of the paintings I most remember of his actually prominently featured bold reds and greens. It was a still-life self-portrait, which was a still-life of objects that were important to us, so it may have been a very intentional color choice.  He was also, like, the best golfer on the school golf team. A teammate finally put two and two together and, realizing that colorblindness meant he would struggle to differentiate between different shades of red or green, asked, “Hey, if you’re colorblind, how can you tell the difference between the green and the rough?” He couldn’t. He said he aimed for the flag. He was so good at golf in part because he didn’t have the option to just aim for the green - he always had to aim for the hole. Humans are so adaptable.
Just a reminder; all of his videos are on YouTube. :D  https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc
I feel like it could be interesting to see a color blind person paint using colors as they look good to them. Be an interesting perspective.   Like they're painting with colors they see differently but the way they see them looks good together but for anyone who sees the colors, it looks completely different.
"He was the artist version of Auguste Gusteau, the chef from Ratatouille. ""Anyone can paint"""
That man fucking loved cottages in the woods. His show was an entire cottage industry. 
[Here's a higher-res image of the finished product](https://wendylovesjesus.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/bob-ross-painting3.jpg). (Not sure if this is the one he painted live or if it's one of the other versions.)
Happy neighbors make good neighbors. There are no mistakes in life, only happy little accidents that bring us together. See the light in others mistakes so that you may walk hand in hand with joy in your hearts and peace in the neighborhood.
"Colorblind guy: ""Damn, that was just my excuse because I didn't want to paint, but Bob Ross keeps trying to make me paint for him."""
This taught me that i know nothing about golf. I assumed everyone aimed for the flag
Less than 0.01% of people who are colorblind would have their colors skewed enough to really change their perspective. [image](https://images.sobadsogood.com/what-it-looks-be-colorblind/6.jpg) Tritanopia is extremely rare
Some consider singing a form of art.  EDIT: Most, even.
The thing I love about both him and Mr.Rodgers is that they never tried to tell you that everyone is special but instead framed it as being happy with who you are, everyone is different and it's okay to be happy with how you are different.

There may come a time when the troubles of life sink deep into the bristles of our souls and we are  driven towards despair.

I feel like back in the day, Bob Vila could have gone on that list too. But it seems that the internet hasn't propped up his legend the same way as these other three. Or maybe it's just because he isn't dead yet.
I didn't know that I really needed to read this today, but I definitely did.
Beat the devil out of it. Ross 6:23
Bob Vila is the reason I've always adored old American houses, and the reason I'm now stuck with a 120+ year old monstrosity. Turns out, I'm not as handy as Bob inspired me to believe I could be.

Dame.  Lillard.  I hope he wins a ring.  Every single team in the league would take him in a heartbeat, and I guarantee most have tried.  He doesn't wanna be a part of their circus.  He's got a team that treats him right, a community that loves him, and he returns their loyalty in kind.  Oh and also, he's a stone cold killer on the court.  He doesn't need to talk trash, doesn't need to percieve some slight from the other team to motivate him, doesn't posture.  He's just better than your guy, and he's finna show you.  He also has a level of self-awareness that most humans period don't possess, much less one with so much talent, Fame and money.  There's a role model right there.    And Hulu has live sports, y'all.
I am so happy that Dame is finally getting respect in the greater public sphere.
How can you not like this guy?

Reminds me of Chris Rock’s bit about alimony in context of OJ. If you have $20 million and your wife want $10m, big deal, you ain’t starving. But if you got $30k and your wife want $15k, you might have to kill her.
Pressure is when you play for five dollars a hole with with only two in your pocket ~ Lee Trevino
There's also no crying in baseball.
Always lifting up his teammates as well.  Really wholesome team to follow.
I'm so glad Dame is finally getting recognition in the NBA. The players all know he's one of the greatest. LeBron gives him cred, and Patrick Beverly has said he's the toughest guard to defend.   After the OKC series the fans have started to realize it, and it makes me so happy. I don't think we'll do as well vs the Nuggets because they might keep their cool, but I'm excited to see Lillard pop off again.
He's turning into an absolute superstar. Probably the second best PG in the league behind Steph, and he's definitely not far behind
I can see some Rockets and Thunder fans not liking him. Everyone else can fuck off though
You are outstanding.  [He didn't mean it](https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard/status/1122930713114886144).  Also, look how calmly he reacted to that person acting like a clown on Twitter.
It's all in the hips
Pressure is inversely proportional to the volume. ~ Robert Boyle
I'm a rockets fan but I really like him. Don't see why I wouldn't. Sure he hit a buzzer beater against us but that wouldn't make me dislike him
Classy guy for even offering a clarification - nothing swings by the masses without a shred of offense being administered.
Just tap it in.
I'm a Celtics fan, too, and I would take Dame over Kyrie in a heartbeat, just for his basketball skills alone. His personality and demeanor are icing on the cake.
World is flat Vs There are bigger issues than basketball
And here I am, intentionally going to different stores and gas stations because  I don't want the staff to recognize me as a regular.
This happened to me. I used to go to Dunkin’ Donuts everyday on break from work and get the same coffee and bag of hash browns. The guy there knew my order and would always have it ready. One day I came in and I was in the mood to try something different so I ordered a muffin instead with my coffee. The guy looks at me and goes “no hash browns?” And I was like thought I would try something different today. When he handed me my order he went “I put the hash browns in the bag too cause I already had them ready for you shhh it’s our little secret”. That bag of free hash browns honestly made my whole day :)))
This is a wholesome level threat
This is wholesome sure, but who in gods name buys burritos from a gas station? I’m a little concerned about this man  Edit: y’all pls stop blowing my inbox up, I get it, small towns LMAO  Where I live our gas stations aren’t really attached to restaurants or anything. We have a lot of home-owned roadside diners or little deli shops and general stores _separately_ so I’m just not used to people trusting gas station food
I work at a gas station and honestly this is the shit we live for. Having loyal customers makes all the other shit we deal with almost worth it.
Ima gear a BONELESS PIZZA and a 2 liter coke
Every morning i go to a corner store by my house for a pack of smokes and a monster. Over the years the clerks have just started getting everything out and ringing it up before i get to the store. Ive even caught them training new employees to do the same.
Your usual half dozen donuts and a diet Dr. Pepper? Here you go . . .
Ha! Me too! Went to Popeye’s one day and the lady at the register recognized me & my vehicle and rang up my order before I said anything. She was so sweet & proud of herself! So I never went back.
My grandfather went to Dunkin’ Donuts for his coffee every day. Always got the same thing, got his senior discount and all. The ladies who worked there all knew him and started calling him Pops. He’d walk in and they’d start getting his coffee ready so by the time he was at the register it was waiting for him. When he got cancer and was too sick from the chemo to go, we’d go in and say “I’m here for an order for Pops.” They’d get his coffee ready and even give the senior discount. They all legit cried the day my dad went in for something for himself and they asked if it was an order for Pops and my dad had to break it to them he had died. I later felt bad that we didn’t go tell them sooner because I guarantee at least a few of the people who worked there would have come to the funeral. Always be a kind person and you will be rewarded with returned kindness and love in droves.
My brotha right there
This is why you should always look service workers in the eye and make small talk. Ask them about their day. People are almost always more glad to talk than you think they might be, and having a happy interaction with a stranger really does make your whole day better, and makes a town or city feel more like a community.   A recent study asked 100 people to say something to strangers each day. Something like 90% had a positive experience and 99% were glad they did it.   Edit: Found the study.  > Dr. Sandstrom’s research shows people underestimate how much another person will like them when they talk for the first time. And in a study in which she asked participants to talk to at least one stranger a day for five days, 99% said they found at least one of the conversations pleasantly surprising, 82% said they learned something from one of the strangers, 43% exchanged contact information, and 40% had communicated with one of the strangers again, an indication they might be making friends.   I've gotten free food before from doing it, and even if I do have some anxiety over getting recognized at places in my neighborhood that I frequent, I've never regretted it.  [Here's a whole article on it!](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-surprising-boost-you-get-from-strangers-11557567000)
Small towns, man.    Some gas stations are restaurants too, to the point that some deliver food as well
"If I was that guy, I'd come into you store ordering both the beer and the burrito, by saying, ""here for my usual beerrito"", and we'd both laugh and smile and when I'd leave we both say, ""he's such a great guy."""
2 liter machine 🅱️roke
Do they refer to you as the smokey monster in the training manuals?
I worked at a gas station for about a year and a half, and we would do this for our regulars who smoke/chew.   It was awesome when one time, we had it all ready to go and the guy said “no smokes this time, I quit”
2 liter diet dp
Basic human decency... Wow... I thought that was only a myth...
that is the equivalent of the stray dog coming to your house for food, then suddenly vanishing
"Haha yeah... there is a Wendy's near my work I started going to twice a week-ish, and at one point someone working the register only got as far as ""I should remember your name, you're in here all the time."" And I never went back."
It was really sad seeing my grandpa’s coffee buddies at his funeral.
I always ask how they’re doing today and the enthusiasm in which some answer me, like no one has ever asked how they are before, makes me so sad. Everyone should be kind to everyone. It’s not difficult to be kind. Like, at all.
A-fucking-men. We have a local gas/general store chain and they pump out the best hot bar style sandwiches, pizza, etc, and occasionally do things like fried chicken or a full turkey dinner. The coffee isn't the best bit its $2 for a large to go with the meal, can't  beat it.
The only place open 24hr in my college town is a gas station. And they have a kitchen where they cook burgers and fries and pizza and wings and so much else and you can call ahead at 3 in the morning and eat a hot meal. It's amazing.  Owner makes so much bank he bought 2 other places last year. Awesome dude.
are you stoned right now because i am
I feel bad getting a 2 liter but when its 99 cents and a 20 ounce bottle is 1.89 or whatever...I feel like I have to
Damn, this shit hits close to home. My grandfather used to go to Dunkin’ Donuts twice a day for coffee. It was a thing we did together, and if I wasn’t with him he’d usually sit and drink his coffee by himself. In the last few years of his life he became friends with a group of people who also went there every night. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and pretty much stopped going. He died 6 months later. And although he didn’t have a funeral, his coffee friends stopped by his house to offer condolences to my grandmother.
I like to buy a scratch off lottery ticket and tell the person behind the counter that i'll split my winning with them if I win anything. I do this fairly often, it's only a $1 at a time so why not. A few years ago I bought a scratcher and told the lady behind the counter i'd split my winnings with her. I scratched it and won $500! So I split it with her, and she started crying her eyes out, losing her shit, and hugging me. Turns out she was flat broke working the only job she could get, midnights at the kwikshop, with a broke down car and was losing hope. I was glad I could help her, even if it was by luck. I stayed friends with her for a few years until I moved. Nice lady.

Took him an entire season to clean up the trash thooo
The lovely stoners over at r/trees got really into this before winter and called it the stoner cleanup initiative or something? It was really popular 
"He fucked it up by calling the ""bored teens"" out.  Now they know it's not cool and won't do it. "
My library loans out litter cleaning kits!   Each kit includes:  4 Litter Grabbers  4 Safety Vests  Bags  1 Bucket  It is really cool resource.   My son loves to clean up the river shore behind our house. He's got a pretty cool glass bottle collection going.   
If this post gets a lot of traction, maybe more people could sub there, then the challenge would get more attention and maybe it could really become a thing. Like the ice bucket challenge. It could be like the #detrashedchallenge or something catchier.  Edit: since this is gaining traction, there have been a lot of good ideas further down this thread that might not get seen. The names #trashtag or #trashtagchallenge seem to be very catchy and easy to remember (they rhyme)  Also, to the people saying it’s too much of an undertaking for people to actually do it, the ice bucket challenge had an option to donate to an ALS charity instead of doing the challenge, and that raised a TON of money. If reddit could decide on a reputable environmental cleanup charity, people could be given that option and I bet it would have at least somewhat of an impact.  Anyway, those are just thoughts. Please keep the discussion going.  Edit2: r/trashtag has been created to post these pictures

The information/research is handily available but it's not like the BB community is saying ""you need this to get like me"" it's more like ""understand what you're getting into before you do it""   They don't ignore the downsides and only glorify the upsides, they embrace both sides of the coin.

 A power bottom is a bottom that is capable of receiving an enormous amount of power.
I don’t know what I was expecting when I clicked that...
Very true. [Here's actually a great video explaining the pros and cons if steroids](https://youtu.be/RD_44xEEDjU). Highly informative. 
I dunno man that whole industry is weird. They get these roided up guys to sell high protein candy bars and milkshakes like that's what got them so big. 
Man and Wife, you may kiss the redditor 
Or insecurities
“Does the power have to do with the size... or the strength... of the bottom?”
Morbid curiosity is one hell of a drug

Oh my god, I was praying it was broscience and you did not disappoint 
... You know what, maybe I won't take steroids 
It sucks, but roids are illegal, so most sponsers are not gonna endorse you if you speak about use.
That’s going to be the title of my fucking autobiography I swear. Morbid curiosity has led me to doing some real dumb shit
If roids were legal nobody would buy the candy bars and milkshakes, they'd buy roids. There's an entire industry that pretends candy bars and milkshakes have the effects of roids. 
I dunno about that, i think plenty of people who lift casually would still want their post-workout protein shake but wouldn't want to start roids. I'd guess a lot of people wouldn't want to go that hardcore.
A couple years, this boy invited my son to his birthday party, which was on a Saturday.  Well, Friday, my kid broke his arm and we couldn't get in to see the ortho until Monday, so he was basically on in a sling and on bed rest all weekend as to not further aggravate the injury.  I texted this kids mom Friday night and let her know my son couldn't come to the party, and she dropped that this boy only invited my son-- the birthday boy is autistic, and even though he's a really great kid (I even like hanging out with him!) I guess most of the classmates treat him like crap.  So, we ended up changing the plans that this boy could come over to my house, we rented a few movies, got pizza delivered, etc.  So, this kid's birthday party ended up being the two of them hanging out on my couch playing minecraft and watching TV.
I remember in 5th grade there was a girl who was a lot different and people made fun of her and stuff, but she was actually pretty nice. She invited everyone in our class of like 25 or so. 2 other people in our class went, one who was a big troublemaker but actually chill, and the other who was really nice to her and always partnered with her. There were a lot of people in our class who threw them away, and some that just couldn’t make it, but I couldn’t cause I had football, but I still went after. Our teacher talked to us as a class when she wasn’t there and she even cried. Felt so bad for her.
Edit: My first post got taken down due to the mans twitter handle being posted. Still think it deserves to be on here! 
This is depressing.
This reminds me of a party I had but no one showed up and instead of being a kid I was 17 and it was my graduation party. I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with this kind of stuff ever again. 
I had a similar circumstance with my boy last month. It both warms my heart and makes one sad.
Amen to this. My brother told me a story about when my nephew was in kindergarten. Apparently, this one little boy was the outcast (can’t remember if he had a disability or maybe there was no reason for it, you never know with kids) but my nephew was always friendly to him and included him.   My brother was so proud because at some parent thing that boy’s father went looking for my nephew’s parents to thank them for raising their 5 year old to be inclusive and make sure his son felt welcome.   I told my brother how cool it was that my sister-in-law and him made sure my nephew knew to not focus on differences just be friendly.   He’s still a great kid now that he’s in high school. So proud of him and his parents. 
My mom made me invite a kid nobody liked in 3rd grade. He smelled terrible and was weird. He couldn’t make it to the party but at school thanked me and said it was the first time he was ever invited anywhere. Hung out with him a little and later learned he smelled terrible because he was abused and neglected at home. Had such bad anxiety sometimes he had trouble controlling his bowels and was always gassy. They never did his laundry.   Lost touch after 8th grade but I know from about 4th to 8th I was his only friend. Hope he’s doing alright. Teach your kids to be nice. 
Unfortunately, I've seen parents who are jerks turn their kids into jerks.  When they were young the kids themselves were nice.     Their parents taught them they were great athletes and were better than other people and had nicer stuff. They literally installed a we are better than you attitude. 
People should reward their children when they make good things. I’ve seen parent not caring when their child did something nice to someone else, and then lose their shit when the child accidentally dropped a glass cup. It messes with the child’s brain during a very important time in their life. 
It seems like the concept of common decency is a dying trait. When I was little, if I was invited to a birthday party (whether I liked the kid or not) my parents would make sure we were there. Lately it seems like all my friends with kids end up feeling awful because their little one is upset that no one showed to the party.   Parents go out of their way to prepare a party for their child, and then no one they invite with the exception of one sweet child shows up. How shitty is that? 
"This reminds me of a birthday party I went to when i was 10 or 11. Except the birthday girl invited the entire class. I wasnt really friends with her but I  bought her a doll and asked my mom to take me.  This kid lived in the middle of nowhere and my mother, having no sense of direction, was struggling to find the place so badly I thought we would never make it there. She was frustrated but kept trying, especially  since I was visibly anxious about getting there on time.  I think that my mom thought it was a big party and that's why I was so emotional about my attendance.  When she finally found the house she asked if I was sure we were in the right place as the home was in bad condition and littered with junk. She asked me which of my friends were coming and I had to tell her ""mom I dont think anyone's coming, that's why I came"". She cried. And I wanted to cry because this girl had gotten ice cream cake and enough hats and party games for a bunch of kids. She was bullied by almost every kid in school and still invited EVERYONE  to her party. "
As a bigger and protective type kid, I went out of my way in elementary school to befriend a kid who was on the smaller and nerdy side that a lot of people used to pick on. People didn’t pick on him anymore, and he eventually came out of his shell to make a good amount of friends. It doesn’t take much to change someone’s life for the better, forever.
I want kids like nothing else, but this scares me. Kids just ain't nice sometimes 
Just playing devil's advocate here... What if they're the only two bullies at school?
You and your son are awesome!! 
The world needs more people with empathy, so thank you for coming inside your wife.  EDIT: I'm spanish speaker so I've edited almost every word because I speak English like Mao Tse Tung 
Awwwwww. That sounds pretty great, honestly.
Wholesome! I aspire to be a great parent like you one day. 
In high school I was invited to a girls party and we weren't even that close but I went and had a good time although there was one other person from a different school there and judging by the supplies she had picked up it was supposed to have more people. But we had a great time and we were friends throughout the rest of school.
This is how I have my best friend. In the 6th grade I invited basically everyone to my pool birthday party. My mom bought so many hamburgers and hotdogs. There were water balloons and a pinata. Only one girl from my homeroom class came and we had a fucking blast! 19 years later and she is still my ride or die.

You can post it on the coments if he consents obviously 
It’s definitely bittersweet.  Happy cake day?
I feel you. Only two people showed up for my friend bridal shower out of 20. 
"When I was in kindergarten, my classmates all got invited to a birthday party, but mine got lost? I remember asking him about it, and it did seem deliberate, but he said I was invited.  Being the odd one out sucks, and at a young age it's even harder to have to accept that sometimes.  Most of us ""weird"" kids turned out pretty well, as far as my weird circle of friends is concerned."
This breaks my heart...  Your mom is awesome tho
This was my parents’ attitude and I somehow always knew that they were wrong. Their attitudes were childish and downright embarrassing. They tried to instill in me many horrible beliefs that I thankfully rejected. 
One of my moms things was that she would strictly never reword good acts with physical stuff.   If I was rude or not nice she would take away stuff, but doing good was just emotional praise.   Her reasoning was she wanted nice to be normal, and she didn’t want me or my sister doing nice things only for a reward.   It turned out well but idk how well it would of worked if I was a worse child. Nor do I know wha she would of done if I ever misbehaved Worst thing I ever did as a kid was stay up late and eat extra fruit snacks.   I also failed religion (only class I was close to failing) at a catholic school. My mom was a bit impressed that somone could fail religion, walked up to the teacher, asked what I was doing. His response was that I was one of the best students and did all the homework, but I asked questions on why god would do XYZ when it didn’t fit with ABC elsewhere in the Bible and I needed to know not to question the Bible and God. I had no computer or phone access after that report card. After talking to the teacher I had it back and she said she was sorry that he was the teacher.
Perversely, bullies tend to be quite popular. 
He is FAR more awesome than I am, if I could say so myself lol.
I... am I reading this right?  I think I am.  Um.  You're welcome?  
They had a blast!
If I could impart any one piece of parenting advice, it would be that no matter what you do, you're going to screw up somewhere along the line.  Just roll with the punches, and everything will be okay.
Kindness, is there anything it can't do? :)
People come and go in life, I don't think a lot of people can say they have childhood friends and well into adulthood. I've moved a lot growing up, I sometines wonder where and how my childhood friends are in their story of life. 
Oh hey it's been a year. Thanks!
When I got married, some people I invited who I thought were friends didn’t show up. They didn’t bother telling me either. Fast forward 8 years, those people aren’t in my life and haven’t been in my life for quite some time. It still hurt though at the time.   I didn’t even have a bridal shower put on by my friends. My husband’s parents did and his family was all there. It was a blast though!
My mum remembers a girl in my second grade class inviting everyone but me and the aboriginal girl. They all left after school together with balloons and presents while we were at the pick up area by ourselves. She said she bawled her eyes out it was so awful. Glad I was too young to remember that one. 
Seriously. Growing up you’re always like “ugh why did my parents make me invite that outcast?!” But you later realize they were just teaching you to be kind to everyone and not judge someone by their appearance 
Well raising a kid who's better than you are is pretty much the ultimate parenting goal so good job on that!
I’m gonna cry oh my god   thanks for the likes
Being a spanish speaker doesn't help me too much, but I'm glad I could make you feel awkward. 
My homework
I've been friends with my best friends for 21 years and it's falling apart now. 21 years of ride or die, ups and downs, being eachothers right hands through some of the worst shit in our lives and now they just refuse to be the friends I need them to be.  I havent seen them in 6 months because whenever I invite them out they don't respond or make me come to them. I invited them out for my birthday and they asked me to change my plans entirely, blow off my 6 other friends, and drive 20 minutes to go to a bar they preferred. When I told them I wouldn't they didn't come to my party.   I really sucks but they're growing into people I don't particularly like. 21 years and they wont even meet me half way.
What is more depressing than this post is that your karma is in the 400,000’s and in in the 200’s. You’ve only been on it for a year too. I’m sad.
I didn’t realize how truly engrained racism against Aboriginals is in some places until I recently remembered a childhood experience from many years ago...I moved to Canada from the Middle East as a kid and my family is originally from northern India. Along with Hindi, English was my 1st language but I obviously didn’t have a Canadian accent and looked different so other kids would ask “what I was”. When I said Indian they would laugh! 1 girl even made a weird yodeling/howling sound and I was so confused! Told my mom & she said it was because they thought I meant “Red” Indian and white people in Canada don’t like them. Turns out racism against anyone not white-Canadian (including actual India Indians) was still quite accepted in early 2000’s Canadian culture, so I was still bullied by some kids (and teachers) for a couple years but it would have been even worse if I was a “red” Indian 🙄 Like imagine 6 YEAR OLDS thinking someone being aboriginal is funny and deserving of mockery?? They obviously got that from their trashy parents. 
It really is.  I'm trying to make sure my kids grow up to be better than i ever was or could be.
Who is cutting those onions in here. 
Find the guy/girl with real good grades who always smells of mouthwash and carries around a conspicuous gallon sized bottle of sunny d or something. 
Sorry, that would be me, im trying to cook a salad.
You don’t make friends with salad.
My grandpa lived with my family growing up and he had alzheimers. I'd be playing NBA Live and he'd watch and comment thinking it was an actual basketball game on TV lol.
My grandpa does that too, I love it \^\^  Now whenever I see him working on his Truck, I ask him the same :)
Mine passed I loved him
"""I am now, thank you.""  😭"
Playing minecraft, still telling him yes
You know, as a Millennial with Gen z kids, I really enjoy how we can relate to their games. That when my kid plays Apex, I understand that game and can ask about his favorite characters, guns, about his exploits in the game. My youngest is a Zelda nut and loves the SNES one so that one is real easy to relate to. My dad never really played a video game in his life. He had no idea what the hell I was doing on that machine.
You had me in the first half.... not going to lie
"My dad be like: ""better buy drugs than video games."
Alright this is gonna get lost but who cares it’s a wholesome story  So my dad had his own version of this. He passed away right at the end of 2018, and I’ve been thinking about him, and this reminded me of something.   I lived games. He had bought me, at that point, all the games I had wanted, all Nintendo games. He would try to play with me sometimes, and he never won (except on this n64 racing game - he was good at that one) but he would play with me. I could go on...  Anyways, he got into the habit of saying stuff like “oh, well, I’m winning and you just don’t see it,” and “no, see, I’m setting up the super thing and I’m gonna win the whole thing” when there wasn’t a super thing, and this went on and on.  Eventually it boiled down to him looking into the room, watching me play for a moment, and then saying “am I winning? I think I’m winning.” Made me smile every time.  I miss you dad.
Not my grandpa, but my grandma! I even showed her how to play Nintendogs!
I would play 2d fighting games in front of my grandmother and she would be genuinely confused as how these fighters are still standing after several obviously fatal blows.
That’s nice tho that you were okay with it
"Should've been like ""Hey grandpa, want a little side action on this game? Who do you think will win? You pick a team and $10 says the other team will win?""  Edit: Seriously tho, don't swindle your grandpa with dementia."
That is so sweet!
That's either the best or worst question you can ask someone working on a vehicle depending on the answer

Rip your grandpa.
I mean you can lose if you die too much and rage quit + delete your save
This super relatable. The only reason I touch fortnite is to play with my 10 year old son. He's actually really good and he's super passionate about the game. I enjoy seeing him doing something that makes him feel good.
I originally got this from mildly infuriating when someone said it’s annoying when  anyone over the age of thirty says it, and I thought that it was actually a good thing
My mom played animal crossing city folk for so long she contributed almost all the fossils and fish to the museum
"Mine would ask, ""Are they dead yet?"""

Would take a pretty worthless human to not be OK with it
Really that's sweet af ❤
As a diy mechanic, the answer is NO, IM FUCKING NOT
I’m using reddit to pass time cuz I can’t sleep
Maybe the real defeat was the friends we lost along the way
That last sentence though
What? Why would anyone be mad at ANYONE of ANY AGE for asking if youre winning? Like ???
"""Are they dead yet?""  ""Are they dead yet?""  ""Are they dead yet?""  ""Are they dead yet?""  ""Are they dead yet?""  edit: Yall better have understood my reference! (TFS)"
Then you would reply “Are you dead yet?”
I don't know anything about street fighter but did you mean licks?
Right lol  “ah, he should’ve hit that shot there, he’s not doing too well tonight” “Fuck off grandpa”
Just remember it's a war made of many small battles
Hope you sleep well homie
It’s okay, in the morning when you’re pooping we’ll see you back here :)
Soon grandmother time will take us all
Damn this got dark very fast
Licks is an old slang word for hits
it's good to see a man dedicated to make the life of his students better
He blew himself for your own enjoyment. He deserves some respect. 
I can't even begin to imagine what the person who took the picture was annoyed about. This is good stuff.
I'd like to imagine that he does that every year with some pre-prepared puns and jokes 
Also respecc for the guy standing up to that mean witch.
I had an astronomy teacher who dressed as Galileo one day (not Halloween) and she taught the entire class in character. It was so much fun.
Papa Smurf can I lick that ass
Love this guy. 
What do you expect from someone with a handle like @lilcollegegirl
I'm imagining it and I enjoy the results. 
I wish people weren’t so negative.   I had a history professor who would sometimes dress up, or do something spooky like turn all the lights out and read a poem by candlelight. You could always hear people sniggering but I thought it was the BEST and I remember those particular classes/topics a lot better than the others from the same course.   A+ to any prof who does something cool like this! 
That dedication is what makes or breaks a teacher; absolutely!
I had him for an Intro to Soc in undergrad and enjoyed his lectures so much I took a couple more. His research is focused on fertility, particularly infertile couples.  There are many good, characterful professors at that school so its hard to pick a top 10 let alone 5 but I’d say he’s in there for sure.  Edited to add he’s very funny and kind, and when he’s lecturing he’ll occasionally drape his arm over his head and absentmindedly twiddle his beard.
Just look at the next semester as anustart
Yeah, whenever I see that kind of attitude, I don't get it. Let people be silly and enjoy life. 
I didn't read it as annoyed, I just read it as surprised
I work for the university he teaches at and I think this picture was taken last year, but he dressed up the same way today as well. 
"Replaces every other word with Smurf. But before that says "" this will be on your test"""
If a guy is mean is there something magical we can call them, wizard sounds too cool.
The full commitment to character really  makes it. I’m a high school teacher and my principal dressed as Buddy the Elf today and gave all announcements in character. Most notably the middle of first hour when he broke in to ask everyone what their favorite color is.
You can lick my ass bitch.

100% agreed DJ_Clitoris!
He’s the world’s only professor who moonlights as an analrapist.

She put that face palm emoji.
Fuck it i believe you
"""You're such an ogre!"" was the best I could come up with"
r/rimjob_steve 
any relation to the phulonrapist?
The face palm emoji was kinda what convinced me they were annoyed
At first I didn't, but then I saw the emoji, and the only time I see that emoji is when someone is annoyed or face palming at someone else (in a rude way). But you're right, it could very well be that the person was pointing out how silly the situation was. 
That little emoji really changes the whole tone of the message.  I almost missed it and was wondering what everyone was so annoyed with.
This is a pic taken of him this morning, posted to the University Facebook page.   https://i.imgur.com/4siEFHH.jpg

I like how he calls him out by name implying he knew who it was all along and played along with it, even when it's at his expenses. Moe's a good sport.
This is not from the real episode this is photoshopped
Breathtaking.
Did you know that Bart is actually voiced by a female voice actor
Source?
Hank Azaria has said that Moe is his favorite character to voice on the Simpsons :D. [Moe is based on gravely young Al Pacino](https://youtu.be/O5TaYFi4UVA?t=116).
There was an episode where Bart said “my name is Jimbo, I live at [address]”. **Moe* ran over to the house fully intending to harm (though not kill) jimbo with a knife.
This is photoshop
TFW one of the loops on the corded phone mysteriously became inverted. Just one. Nobody knew why or when it happened, it just did.
Now I'm sad :(
You're breathtaking!
The shot of Bart is him actually calling for a “Jazz, first name Hugh” - sorry to disappoint.  edit: https://youtu.be/y3kVTUHRbWM
Same. I am hoping it actually happened, though. Poor Moe.
Most young boy cartoons characters are voiced by females

You'd think Moe would be the hardest on his throat, you know, what with the gravel and all.
"Moe: ""Barney don't steal any beer while I'm gone!""  Barney: ""What kind of pathetic drunk do you take me for?? Whoa! Someone spilled beer in that ashtray! *drinks* aaaahhhhh...""  *Later*  Moe: ""Shoot, I have to go check on Barney!""  Barney: *drinking beer straight from the tap for who knows how long* ""Uh oh! My heart just stopped!...........Ah there it goes"" *starts drinking again*"
My dad always said it happened when grandma (his mother in law) called because she is twisted   This is headcannon that irritable mother in laws calling makes phone cords twist up

"As an English teacher, can confirm. Would accept ""Neil"" with evidence tweet. Excellent work A++"
Neil Gaiman is the Chaotic Good's Chaotic Good
Well this made me grin like a stupid idiot
For anyone who hasn't read any of Neils work, read Neverwhere. You will not regret it. But you cant go wrong with any of his books 
I would love to see your teachers face when you show her/him 
Neil himself is a chill dude. I think he liked one of my tweets before
I love this so much ❤️❤️  Several years ago, I wrote an Amazon review on a great book by one of my favorite modern writers - Jae. She apparently somehow ended up reading the review and not only took the time out to thank me for the review but to also send me one of her new books that hadn't even been released yet. We've spoken since and, although I wouldn't necessarily consider her a friend, she's very sweet and very down to earth.
Ok cool, thanks.  “Why American Gods Sucked”
American Gods is a brilliant book

Someone gilded a bot wtf

How’d this get gold
I want to know the reasoning for this gold, did someone find this bot comment super amusing? Didn’t it make their day? Had they never heard of unexpectedlywholesome and they were so happy that they gave gold? We may never know. 
What grade do you teach? 
"I have adhd. i took ap calculus in highscool. My calculus teacher noticed i  would run out of ""stamina"" so she let me take half the test during class, and the other half after school.   Now take that customized teaching she did for me, and apply it for every student she had. She learned what her students needed to be successful and adapted. She was better than any college professor i got. I'll never forget when she hugged me with tears in her eyes as i got my diploma.  All this to say, you rock."
Am an art teacher. If one of my students went out of their way to contact and artist i'd die of happiness
"Pretty mild mannered chaos, though. ""Haha, that bookseller may never know that I've secretly autographed my books and directed my followers to purchase books from their store!"""
Same here. Twitter and the internet is amazing. You can reach out to so many people you look up to so easily even though you feel like you are worlds apart.  Recently I sent a fanart to an artist I admired and he replied in just a few hours. It's an amazing experience getting recognition and direct interaction from someone you look up to.
Have you also read Norse Mythology? Ordered it yesterday. 
Pretty sure their English teacher would dock you points for not just saying 'them'
He liked one of my tweets too. I went on a long winded praise of American Gods and how much his writing has meant to me. I got so excited when I got the notification he had liked it.

Not who you asked, but I really enjoyed it. He tells the myths pretty true to form, but he adds his touch into them in a way that feels seamless. 
Thank you for being an educator that our world truly needs.
might i ask if this author Neil Gaiman writes on these themes of chaos and the chaotic good?
That’s ridiculous. People have been using the singular “they” for 700 years. No one has a problem with it but English teachers/professors with a stick up their ass.   
You say that, but he only does it to get free drugs from students in exchange for good grades.

I’d love to make it a monthly reward or something but I’ve been nervous about asking. We don’t need a grand tour or anything, just someone to walk us around the truck for a few minutes.   I’m gonna pop in and ask.  Edit: love all the responses and thank you stranger for the gold. I knew they’d be open to the idea but didn’t realize just how open firefighters are to special needs guests.
Oh man, fire houses are going to be so pissed in a few days when this catches on.      edit: TIL Firemen are really pumped about the prospect of people coming by to give them something to do.    I cant wait till my son is a little older, im going to walk him into a fire dept and hes going to be so impressed!
Are you Freddie Mercury?
That 'stache is glorious. Freddie would be proud.
See fire departments all over the US love when ANYONE comes in and shows interest! Go get an app and join, we need you!
As a recovering non-asker, I feel like this is responsible for the majority of the gap between dreamers and dream-realizers.  Sometimes you don’t ask, sometimes you don’t know how to even ask the right question. But ask! People generally like helping people.
He’s having such a good time.

"I too was all like ""Was Freddy Mercury a firefighter?"""
do it! you have nothing to lose. this is the only life we get. Hell, I might go join in
I’m a firefighter and it would absolutely make my week if someone did this.
Absolutely do. I’m an autistic firefighter and that would make me so happy if someone did that. Most of us love interacting with the public. Give that guy a fist bump from this aspie 🤜🏻  EDIT: Thanks so much for the silver, stranger! EDIT part 2 electric boogaloo: holy shit my first platinum ever! I can’t believe talking about my autism got me cool internet points, but if that’s what it takes lol. Thank you so much!!
I was in emergency services for years, as a firefighter and EMT, 100% go ask.
I have firemen in my family, as long as there isn’t an emergency to get to, there’s always someone around the firehouse who would love this new trend.
he’s having a ball
Gorgeous and amazing.   What's the story?
Do it. Post about it. Start a thing. BUT you have to bring them cupcakes. Cops get donuts. Firefighters should get cupcakes.  Edit. I swear to gawd I hate my phone I type and post and look and there is always an autocorrect that is completely not even close to what i was meaning.  My technology sucks at reading my mind.
Thank you for your service. You do a lot of shit a lot of people are too scared to do.
Hello, I'd like to ride your firetruck my friend, also, a job as a firefighter would be wonderful, I'm not in the best shape but I make a mean 5 alarm chili  Also can we talk about the fact this dude pictured has @advil? That's probably worth a bit of scratch
I actually live in a town with a fire department that invites families out every Friday evening in the summer to tour the station and trucks.
That's why they call him Mr. Fahrenheit.
just give him a call.
honestly nothing special. just something i’ve always wanted to do. ever since i was a kid and missed school a day that firemen visited as a little field trip. all my friends got to tour the truck/gear and i missed out. every time i saw a fire truck since i wanted to hop in and here i am at 30 years old fulfilling that fantasy.
I’m retired NYPD as well as a Florida Deputy Sheriff. When I had my take home car every one of my family and friends wanted to get in the drivers seat and turn on the lights and sirens! And of course I let them! Also every time I went to a school and did a presentation for the kids the teachers all wanted to turn on the lights and sirens too. Not everyone gets a chance to do that so if you have the opportunity to do it, go for it! Ask!
Your wish is my command
Hey, thank you! That means a lot. But honestly it’s just a job and I love what I do. Thank you for supporting us and paying your taxes so we all get to do a job we love and try to help our community.
He's travelling at the speed of light.
Don’t stop him now!
I think I speak for everyone when I say this. Not only am I living vicariously through your boldness of living this out and getting to sit in the driver seat of a fire truck. But that stache is A1 my man. Hero type shit man you’re a legend.
You're the cop all cops should aspire to be.
He’s gonna make a supersonic man outta you
Cause he’s havin’ a good time!
bro it’s new! my girlfriend randomly asked me if i would do it. she thought it would go well with my cowboy hats. i’m still unsure about it but lots of compliments have come my way and i sure do love attention 👨🏻
Thanks! That made me smile. I appreciate that.
Of course! I first got into this field because of medicine. I became an EMT to get clinical experience for a pre-med degree, but I ended up falling in love with EMS and decided to do that as my career. I worked as an EMT and also volunteered for two years before I decided that I would go all-in and get my firefighter license so I could get a full-time job as a firefighter. In my township, the fire department also does all of the ambulance calls, so that’s most of what we do on a daily basis.   The thing that I enjoy the most about my job is getting to interact with the citizens of our township! Obviously the most common way in which we interact is in an emergency, but I love to interact with and help people in any way we can. Obviously we have the standard calls from grandma fell in the hallway to a car wreck to a heart attack, but also sometimes we get to do things like help our elderly neighbor mow her lawn or help someone who has broken down on the side of the road. All of those are supremely rewarding to me because I try to focus on bringing good to other people as much as I can in life and I feel like this is the job where I am able to help people with my skills as best as I can.   And also, the job is really fucking fun a lot of the time. First, the siblinghood that you develop with your partners is really unlike anything I’ve experienced at a job. We spend 24 hour stretches together so you really get to know a person and get a very good relationship with them. If you have good partners it’s like hanging out with your best friends every day. And then there’s the parts that everyone thinks of as fun like cutting up cars, fighting fires, driving the big trucks, etc. It’s such a rewarding job and it’s really a pleasure to know every day that not only are you doing a job you love, but that you’ll make a difference to someone in that day.   It’s a tough job but I wouldn’t trade it for the world. I think everyone should strive to find a job they love. And also, you don’t have to be in Public Safety to help people. We do just as much for the community as tow truck drivers, trash collectors, powerliners, and everyone else who keeps civilization in line!  If you’re interested, go hang out at your local fire station and get to know the people! If you’re interested, a lot of departments will pay to put you through a fire class if you’re willing to volunteer. We have a shortage of volunteers in the U.S. right now (at least that’s where I am, apologies for being America-centric) and we can always use people who are motivated to help out. It’s also incredibly rewarding if you love the work.   TL;DR: Getting to help people every day, driving the big wee-woo trucks and breaking stuff for a living, making great friends, and an awesome feeling of service.   Please feel free to PM me with any other questions!!  EDIT: holy shit double gold?? I didn’t imagine that me just being candid about my job would illicit such a reaction. Thank you so much to everyone who is being wholesome in this thread. Your support of public service means more than you really could ever imagine. It means the world to get to interact with people when they aren’t in a crisis and that’s one of the parts of this job I love most!
Don't stop him now!
He’s having such a good time
He's a rocket ship on his way mars
On a collision course, he is a satellite
Even if it was 5 seconds ago?
Thank you OP. I really needed to hear that
Mmmmmm •~•  I think I grew a lot as a person
Yet my friends have the full right to laugh at me. I may have grown but it was still **pretty fuckin stupid**
Yeah, I was barely 4 feet tall when I loudly farted after my first kiss.... I’m much taller now
I'm not only cringing at past me, I'm cringing at present me
"Same. It's a good way of thinking about it.  Another good one is:  > ""It's not fair to apply adult-level reasoning to a decision made by a child""."
Happy cake day my dude
I cringe about stuff I did a hour ago
Hi friend, hope you are well! I make quick doodles based off username/comment, and it’s your turn. You are number twenty eight!   https://i.imgur.com/2DyzJqD.jpg
I'm cringing at future me
You underestimate my ability to repeatedly make the same mistake 😎
Oh yes indeed
Thank you :)
Now thats just remorse. I have a lot of remorse.
That’s sick good job
I guess that means it only goes down from here
We all need someone like this
No excuse for lying. Drop her OP. If she isn’t being honest with hugs what else isn’t she being honest with. Hit the lawyer, gym up.
Yep, gr8, haha no I’m not crying myself to sleep alone every night, hahahahaha why would you assume that ? Haha HAHAHA
i do the same for my girlfriend. sometimes when she’s upset she has the tendency to “stay upset” instead of moving on. A nice hug usually cools her off :)
Hug is a powerful thing. My girlfriend demands a hug when shes sad/grumpy/unhappy. And she feels a lot better emotionally after that.
This is so my fiance.Great content yo!
What kind of 24 year old would want to date a 19 year old? I get that reddit is big into defending age differences but that’s the difference between a college grad and a fresh out of hs/freshman college student... just seems weird to me
True selflessness. We all need to be like this! Pay attention & show love to your family, friends, and strangers. There’s a bigger picture out there. Spread more love!
Are you saying that because you need someone like this or because you know someone like me needs someone like this? :/
Not gonna lie
You are now a moderator of /r/relationships
You wanna talk about it?
They're saying that because we all need someone like this.
Well yes but actually actually no
It’s actually so sad, every post there, every reply is run! Dump her! That’s unforgivable! Don’t work on a relationship!    Like damn just because we are all single doesn’t mean everybody should be
I’d love to but it just makes the emptiness in my chest ache more, and besides I’m at work so you know, money over mental health that’s our corporate motto :) and the nationwide corporate motto :)
I mean, I strongly desire someone like this, but I don't necessarily need someone like this  Remember that a key to a healthy relationship is the ability to be an individual, if you can't love yourself how can anyone truly love you?   Remember you are worth loving no matter your situation or past, and that the most important love comes from within yourself, and to love yourself is to be confident in yourself, and with confidence comes the attention of others and draws them to you, if you have that special someone you really wanna get to know better, remind yourself this morning that you are in fact good enough to reach out to them, and remind yourself that you are worth loving and you have cards that you bring to the table, even if you aren't quite sure what they are yet, they will come and you will learn  Love yourself as much As you wish to be loved by others, treat yourself as you want to be treated, and learn to have love and respect for the most important individual that ever will be, and always will be in your life, no matter what happens, yourself.
It’s not much but its honest work. 
You should talk to someone. Recent break-up?
"this is a fantastic way of thinking!  this is how both my wife & I were when we met. we were open to meeting people, but we had very rich lives. we had friends, family, hobbies, jobs that we enjoyed. that's not to say that we were issue-free – both of us had various concerns and stresses.  however, we didn't ""need"" to get married. we didn't ""need"" a relationship to get us through life, to push us through the daily issues.  when we met, we had such a great time. then over time, we developed a strong ""working"" relationship: we kept supporting each other in low key ways, making one another feel loved and yet we were totally unintrusive.  now, I cannot imagine life without my wife. I need her, I love her, I don't really care for life without her. I am like a dog when she comes home - I literally jump up and run to the door and she has to calm me down.  however, it wasn't like that before we started dating. we were happy individuals and I think that's been helpful in us becoming the happy couple we are today.  in some sense, it helps that we're confident that the other can shoulder their own burdens and ours because that's how we lived life for a long time before we ever got together!  I wish you the best in finding a nice person, and regardless, hope you have a wonderful life :)"
Outstanding move!
I don’t know if it qualifies as a recent but it was less than a year ago :/ I should be over it by now but she fucked me up good I guess, doesn’t help that I get to randomly see her and the guy she left me  for on such days as, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and my birthday so far, but I’m just being stupid, I should just not care so I don’t get hurt. And I’ve tried, never really works tho...
You cannot blame yourself for caring. Time heals, but that is still tough as hell. I once had a girl break up with me and get a new boyfriend, while I still had to see her everyday in class. It's not fun. The only thing you can do is fill you life with as much good stuff as possible, so you will have less time to think about her. Being broken up with still sucks buttocks tho :/. I promise it gets better! 
These guys seem pretty cool. I wouldn't mind sharing a pack of thick markers with them. 
Only if I can hold both their hands and they use their massive muscles to swing me like my parents did when I was a child.  I'm a 6'3 man though so I'm not sure how that'd go. Or if it's be possible.
I really like that it doesn't specify women, leaving the opportunity for men to ask for a walking partner too.
On my college campus you can always call one of the campus officers to walk with you. It's great that these guys saw the same need and did something about it!   Edit: For everyone asking why, we have our own police department for campus, which houses around 6000 students. They do anything from find stolen bikes to busting people with weed to catching bats in dorms. If someone has anxiety or feels unsafe in general, they can use this service. Not many people do though, but it's available. This doesn't mean that American campuses are unsafe.
What’s better than this? Just a bunch of guys being dudes. 
I'm pretty sure that this is what healthy masculinity looks like.
Would 100% take a safe and wholesome walk with guy on the left.
Props to these guys. 
All boys, men, and ultimately fathers can prosper with this human integrity.
I love glasscloud. 
At my university we have a walking hotline to call, we also have these alert boxes with bright blue lights on top spaced like a city block apart from each other. Standing at one you should be able to see another one. They have a speaker on them so if you need to call 911 you can and they can talk to you through them, or if someone is chasing you or following you if you press one and walk to the next one and press that one they will track you and intercept you at the closest one you just pressed.
Would fist bump, Tru bros right there.
I’d have appreciated that when I was in college.  There was a period of time where for my safety I could not  walk around campus by myself, and when I left campus to head home I’d either be with a friend or use my schools no questions asked police escort program but that’s really embarrassing to do and isn’t so great when you reek of weed lmfao   I’m here for it 
This is the best comment
I raise you a 64 pack a crayons with a sharpener in the back 
Oh wow, for a minute I thought you were saying you were all Marines. Then I realized you just meant that the poster board could have used some color... I think. Can somebody walk with me?
Maybe if they were on stilts
Your dreams are possible!  https://i.imgur.com/GDsblIv.jpg
don’t give up on your dreams bro 
Bro, it doesn't matter, we are all just us, some get offended by us being us, and in confident enough volumes make a point out of us being us.  Thats when all of us need to step in and make sure the rest of us don't forget who we all are.  Edit: thanks for the gold, I'll use them wisely.
This was my first thought. I wonder if they’d walk with a guy 
We have the same at my university except it's someone from the core of cadets (kinda like ROTC) that walks with you.  Edit: I meant Corp of cadets but I will leave the original as punishment to myself. Also I'm talking about A&M University.
"I started college before ride-sharing was a thing, and the campus police had a ""anywhere within half an hour, we'll send a van to come get you if you feel unsafe, no questions asked"" policy. They got students to volunteer to drive the vans."
I go to a university in a major city that has this kind of program. Instead of walking you, they will pick you up in a university owned car or golf cart. This makes more sense because the campus is massive. It is relevant to note that I get emails from them frequently notifying me about muggings, car break ins, etc. frequently.  I was at the on campus gym until closing around 11:30pm. My car was parked in a lot at one of the furthest ends of campus, maybe a 20 minute walk. It was poorly lit, far from everything, was a gravel lot, and security guards often warned students about its lack of safety, but it was also the cheapest option.   I called for an escort and left the building. The doors were locked behind me because the gym closing. I wait 15 minutes. It starts raining. I call and they say they are on their way. I wait another 10 minutes and call again. Again, I’m told they are just a few minutes away. I was still dry because I was under a covering by the gym doors, but still considered walking to my car in the rain at what was now close midnight. I was eventually picked up and made it to my car in another 30 minutes.  The next semester I paid for the $400 garage parking pass that is close to everything and super well lit.
#WHAT UP!!!  We're three cool guys looking for other cool guys who want to hang out in our party mansion. Nothing sexual.    Dudes in good shape encouraged. If you are fat, you should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, [nothing sexual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jlaZL7CWHY)
Everyone likes to talk about masculinity like it’s a bad thing, but my father has taught me more about how to love others than anyone else I know and he’s very much a “mans man” 
When I talk about toxic masculinity, plenty of other dudes think I'm attacking masculinity.  I am not, I'm attacking the toxic parts that have latched onto it. There is plenty of healthy masculine traits that we need to return to. Like these guys using their size and physical strength to make other people safe.
Or both 
Ultimate fighters*
Entered in commentary section just for that lmao 
That's a really interesting alert system.
A friend of mine had an abusive ex. He’d trail us sometimes. Campus security knew, but my friend hated calling them and calling attention to herself and the situation. One day her ex started following us and yelling at her, asking if she was just going to ignore him (yes). A very large wrestler saw what was going on from across the street, crossed, and just quietly walked with us to our building, then stopped her ex at the door and asked if he had a problem. Her ex backed off really quickly. The wrestler just nodded at us and walked away once her ex was gone. He was a truly awesome guy. 
I don’t get it
Only Crayons!? Come on now, this deserves a whole box of gel pens. 
You want marines?  This is how you get marines.
would have been crayons if they were marines.
"I'm 5'6"" so I could do it.  *Wheeeeeeee*"
Beautifully said, bro. 👊
I’m a large fellow at 6’5” and more than once I’ve noticed smaller guys walking closer than usual to me at night across campus and leaving at the same time from the library   No shame in safety in numbers we had battle buddies in the Corps no reason not to in the real world
I bet they would to seem equal, but it's a service designed to pick up chicks.
It's Corps, FYI. 
I don't think people like to talk about masculinity like it's a bad thing. I think people talk about *toxic* masculinity like it's a bad thing. 
Masculinity, just like femininity, is neither good nor bad, but how one expresses their own masculinity or femininity can be problematic. it sounds like your dad has a very healthy way of looking at it and expressing his own.
"I think a big part of it is just grammar.  Toxic masculinity doesn't mean all masculinity is toxic.   It refers to a subset of masculinity which is toxic.  Like how ""friendly cats"" refers to a subset of cats which are friendly, and is not say all cats are friendly.  Too many people think that masculinity in that sentence is an adjective, when it's actually a noun."
At the same time
Nah, I volunteered for this service at my university back in the day. In my experience, most of the people using this service are fairly timid exchange students. So if thats what you're into then maybe.   But if you're volunteering for this service to meet girls, you're probably part of the reason why people even need this service to begin with.   Kinda fucked up to take advantage of a situation where people feel threatened to fucking hit on them
The sign is written in a very thin way. Seemingly with a finer pointed marker.  A thicker pointed marker would make for a bolder, more readable sign.  Edit: Squinty Dude looks like early Daniel Bryan
One day the marines will learn to read and they'll be really sad that everyone makes fun of their snacks
"The benefit of being 5' 2"" is the possible fantasy of literally getting swept off my feet by my boyfriend. Not being able to  reach the top shelf of supermarkets still bums me out though lol"
5'1, it would be awesome! I don't think my feet would be anywhere near the ground.
Lucky bastard 
Thanks, we can be bros, sisters or whatever and still love eachother, it's really not hard to do right?
"I'm 6' 180lb and never felt nervous walking alone at night on campus until my friend (6'4"" 250lb) got jumped walking alone after a party. Even big bros need help sometimes. Doesn't matter how big you are if its 1v5 and your tipsy "
Maybe they want to pick up guys too? Also to be real I think they are just trying to do a good thing.
At least he got the pronunciation right.
A bicep? If you want it to be like a bicep it needs more veins!!
"Some people don't realize that ""toxic"" is only a *type* of masculinity, not a descriptor of it as a whole."
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This sign screams a great idea made by a bunch of college dudes with the usual amount of planning and preparation put into it by college dudes
*a bolder, more readable taste
Marines eat crayons to gain their powers.
">Not being able to reach the top shelf of supermarkets still bums me out though lol  5' 1"". Had to use a pack of pretzels (the kind in a box) to wiggle a bag of chips off the top shelf today. I give it like 10ish more years and I'll be old enough to carry one of those grabby sticks around the store with without embarrassment. Top shelf items, here I come! "
People also like to start fights with big guys to try and prove something. 
r/BoneAppleTea
I find this overlooked on reddit a lot. A super lot. But you're right. 
Same thing with feminism!
I’d guild you if I wasn’t in debt because of college dude   peace 
I keep licking the screen, but no taste. Makes sense, Cheers!
Very true. Or in my friends case, his cheap watch and $15 from his wallet. It blows my mind people get mugged this day in age because how many people are walking around with a ton of cash on them? I cant remember the last time I kept more than $60 on me 
Hint: they're not confused. They just argue in bad faith.
Also looks like she's just about to burst into tears. And I can't blame her.
I bet the cello sounds amazing in that stairwell, too.
He's just distracting the security guard as part of a plot to steal everything from the locker room. A perfect crime.
That's a beautiful gesture. Judging by her face she really enjoyed it as well.
What a stand up guy
Wow.. thank you for gifting this to a hardworking woman. Not only was she able to enjoy your gift but you also gave her your time which I believe is even a bigger treasure all in it self.
John Williams' music is truly a big part of my childhood. The Harry Potter soundtrack brings me to tears, because of the nostalgia. I hope this woman had the time of her life.
That would be neat but so awkward for me! I don’t even like it when a friend ask me to listen to a song with them, let alone a personal concert! Where do I look? Do I smile? Take pictures? I would work myself up into an awkward anxiety attack!
Bet those stairwell acoustics are 10/10
Was friends with an all-state cellist. She did this for a couple friends once. Stairwell made it sound otherworldly.  I cant imagine how this sounds played by someone with this much experience
“I call this one ‘The Grand Ruse in A Major (Felony)’...”
Looks like he’s sitting down
Security folk are some of the nicest ever people.  I went to a family run but largish multi-day folk music festival on private property when I was in NZ. It was pretty last minute decision so I didn't have a tent/sleeping bag etc as I was hostelling.  I contacted the owners, they said they would find me a tent. Though find you a tent was considered 'you can stay in my tent' by one of the young male organisers, I left when he started trying to feel me up when drunk one night. I slept in the car of someone else I met lol.  Anyway, moving on.  The security were ace. They were these fun, buff Maori guys, who are always huge, but just big teddy bears.  I sat with them at their little station under a gazebo a few times. They made me tea and I crocheted them little geckos that they put on their dashboards.  Fun times.
John Williams has brought us the scores for:  - Jaws - Star Wars - Close Encounters of the Third Kind - Indiana Jones - ET - Home Alone - Hook - Jurassic Park - Schindlers List - Saving Private Ryan - Catch Me if You Can - Harry Potter   Among others. This guy is a legend, and his music will forever be part of my life.
Cello is also the bestest ever instrument!  It's my dream to learn it.
Similar for me, though my buddy was a bassist...he played for me and a small group of friends for my 18th birthday. Said friend still plays professionally and was (is? Not sure how it works) part of the Silk Road ensemble.  I’m was never a great student of music so I almost feel like his performance was wasted on me, but almost 20 years later it’s still a treasured memory.
Guy who lives upstairs from me started learning cello 3 years ago. We've listened to him go from practicing scales to playing full pieces. Sometimes we turn down the tv or stop whatever were doing just so we can hear him play. It's beautiful.
Omg, that's wonderful. Bowed string instruments are such a bitch to learn, and it feels like it takes forever to get to a point where you can even stand the sound of your own playing, let alone have other people enjoy you. One day y'all should tell him how much you like his playing. That might make his day.  Meanwhile I'm just hoping no one calls ASPCA on me and my violin for suspected torturing of a cat.
my cat meowed painfully when I started trying to re-learn violin from a book. Then he threw up. I haven't tried again since (I live in an apartment). However, that was years ago and I believe he's kind of deaf now, so I may give it another go. Although honestly Ive always wanted to give the cello a try....deep resonance.
i'm sorry about how much this made me laugh, but the idea of a cat yeowling and then vomiting as in protest cracked me up. my childhood cat definitely used to burrow under the guest room comforter to exactly the middle of the bed to block out the sound of my violin practice when i was a kid.
Oh my whole heart feels so happy and so broken all at once
Human contact is vastly underrated, a hug from anyone feels good. What an awesome dad to do this.
 HI GAY, IM DAD.
This is both extremely beautiful and extremely sad at the same time.
"I never felt close to my dad, my parents got divorced when I was a baby but he always came around during the summer or my birthday to take me to his place to play video games or watch movies. As I grew older he became more of a close friend but that changed when I came out to my mother and my dad went from close friend to the one that I could trust and moved in with him.  I would like to share just how awesome my dad became  When I came out I wasn't really ready or even had time to think about what could happen. I was 17 at the time and had been texting with a guy off and on. After a few failed relationships I started to notice that I wasn't really enjoying any of them and I was starting to hear about 'gay' and 'bi' at school so I started to experiment online. I was safe, never shared pictures but I was getting into it with this one guy until my mom heard us talking and demanded to know who I was talking to. This was late, my heart left my body and she took the phone from my hands, time stopped as she asked me what I was doing and I said nothing. Than I was asked, 'so are you gay?' I didn't even know but it was nice and I was enjoying it far more than I had previously so I took the leap, not knowing what could happen and said 'yes'.  She didn't say or do anything but stare at me for a moment before saying 'goodnight' and shutting the door. I didn't get my phone back and with school being tomorrow I knew this was only going to get worse. Morning comes and i'm helping my sister get ready (she's in elementary I think around 6 or 7 at this point) and my mom never leaves her room and she is the one who normally helps my sister but I knew why she didn't come out. God just thinking about this reminds me how scared i felt and I've been with my mom through a lot of abusive relationships that got bad but this had me genuinely so scared I felt sick and my head wouldn't stop thinking how fucked I was for saying yes. Fast forward to me getting home and my mom has started doing what she did whenever she was so stressed she wanted to explode, she started cleaning everything no matter what. I tried to talk to her a couple times but she wouldn't even look at me, wouldn't say a word and would only talk to my sister. Next day starts the same except she calls me into the garage after I get home and she sits down with me.  'Sweetie, is this just a phase?' It started, I responded no it wasn't I felt comfortable with another sex as I had found a guy I really truly liked. She gets more upset and brings up religious beliefs I barely held and completely broke them at this point, I push 'if he(god) loves me so much why am I going to hell for loving someone else?' she gets mad, screams in my face says a variety of things including 'you're just stabbing me in the back' she moves into the living room during her rant with my little sister watching shocked and continues to scream at me. I don't say anything because in the moment it felt true. She had managed to get me to think about lying to myself, lying to the one I loved who i'm now married to for 7 years and has become a beautiful woman in her own right. The only reason I didn't let it all go was because I managed to get my phone back and call my dad after a couple days once things had calmed down and I had shut up about everything.  I don't know why I called him, maybe I just needed to feel like someone was on my side even a little. I ask him if I can live with him, tell him what's happening but through tears I barely make any sense so he calls her instead. Well I signed my own death warrant I thought, a few minutes tick by and my mom comes into my room. ""your dad's on his way over, suitcase is in my closet go ahead and pack what you need' she'd become distant after years of being so close, we'd been through so much shit that it still hurts knowing this was the tipping point even if we still speak now on ok terms. I pack up my stuff and as i'm driving back with my dad I ask him what happened in the call, and he just replies with this. ""Well I was gonna call your mom but she called me first, she was freaking out about you. Saying 'our son is gay!' and other shit like that."" He stops to shake his head and shrugs, ""I just responded 'you're surprised Kelly?' You liked a pink fluffy blanket for years growing up, you wanted stuffed animals not action figures I always had the thought but I wanted to let you come out when you felt ready."" That was the day I realized that I actually have a dad, he supported me from that point and his only rule was don't be stupid he met my boyfriend and even helped me along when 'he' became 'she' and never once did he tell me I was wrong all he wanted me to do was stay happy and 'don't be stupid'.  I realize I typed a lot but I never got to really write this down before, I just really wanted to share how awesome my dad is and even though my mom and I talk on good terms she keeps saying she 'doesn't remember' screaming at me for the dreadful end of a week. My dad has become more religious but even still he supports me and I still call him for advice to just hear his casual chilled response to remind me that it's possible to keep a level head no matter what.     EDIT: Thank you all so much for the replies, I had a lot of fun replying to you all :D thanks to the two redditors for the first ever medals to my name. I don't know what else to say but I hope to any of you who had a bad experience coming out know that no matter what people like the dad in this post and my dad fully support you and so do I, maybe one day I'll get to come to one of these and offer hugs not as a dad but as a friend or just a stranger who is genuinely proud that you all made that leap!"
I'm a trans guy who is out to his parents but they won't accept me because of doubts and probably religious bias, I wish I had a parent that truly loved me for who I am and not for what they want me to be. I need a hug like this tbfh
Imagine raising a child, going through a lot of pain and suffering to create a person and then completely reject them just because of who they prefer to fuck?
What a kind man
I honestly don't understand how someone could abandon their child for somthing as trivial as who they love. You can't choose who you love and despite your personal opinions (of which i don't care to hear nor voice my own) they are still your blood and deserve your love if not your approval.
What a wonderful father to the world. I hate how common place the rejection is, but I am so grateful for this man that I’ve never even met. I don’t actually know what it’s like to have a dad, but I’m sure he would let me try to know the feeling, even if only for a few minutes. I appreciate his existence and his selfless acts. THAT is a good human being. I respect him so much and would love the privilege of meeting him some day.
About to become a parent, and I hope my son never feels terrified to tell me if he’s gay/bi/trans/asexual/queer/whatever. Hopefully we won’t need people wearing “free parent hug” shirts in the future, but if so, I’ll gladly give out mom hugs.
I know this is supposed to be wholesome, but it just makes me feel really heartbroken.
Everyone LIKED that. Well done Sir.
Right? I hate this and I love it.   When I came out to my parents, I was terrified. I had my bags packed just in case. I was 17 and loved another girl. She was my first love, and we dated on and off for about three years. It’s so sad that there is so much literal terror involved with telling the people who should love you unconditionally that you like the same sex.  Edit: I’ve had quite a few people ask me about what transpired, and I’ve answered it but it got a tad buried once this blew up. Here’s my response:  I couldn’t even get the words out before I started bawling. I’m an only child and my parents and I are extremely close. I didn’t even have to say it. They knew, because they know me. They knew I was struggling and being secretive. They’d caught me sneaking out. It had caused a lot of tension and anxiety for them and for me. They hugged me and we made some jokes and went out to eat. When I got home, I unpacked my bags. Nothing really changed with our dynamic, but the rest of my family wasn’t as supportive. I dated girls pretty exclusively for about four years. I currently date men, but can appreciate women and am still attracted to them.   I am extremely lucky. My “story” is a bit atypical. I hear coming out stories that break my heart. I’m a teacher, and we have a safe club on campus for students who are questioning their gender or sexuality or who just need a place to be themselves and the first thing they get is a hug and a genuine “I love you” from the club sponsors during club meetings. It’s very moving. In most cases, it’s the only place that they feel free.
"I have a friend from college that lives close by. He and his partner are always into something so we don't see them all of the time but anytime we see one another, he always has the biggest strongest hugs for me. The kind where it says ""I really appreciate you being here with me"".   That says everything that needs to be said about the nature of our relationship and it's just a hug. My wife is the same way. I may not have as many friends as I used to but the people in my life manage to make me feel so good just from those kind of simple things they do.   I hope anyone who hasn't had someone hug them recently gets a chance to have that happen soon."
My friends started a thing where we just hug to say hello and goodbye. It made us a lot closer than we used to be
When I'm drunk at parties I hug all of my friends that are there and tell them how much I love 'em, even texting my other friends who are not there with kind messages, thanking them for all of the things I appreciate them doing and reminding my love for my friends overall. Of course I still hug them when not drunk, but this just reminds that I'm not like my father who was aggressive when drunk and I'm so proud of myself for that.
Your dad power just went up 10 points
“Son”: Dad.... I’m transgender.  Me: *shouting angrily* YOU’RE NO SON OF MINE! *hugs daughter*
Hi Dad, i'm sad :(
yeah, i just thought i want to do that when i get older, but at the same time i hope there's no need for this when i get older
Thank you for sharing. xx
I hope I can be thought of like you think of your dad one day. r/dadgoals (not real)  Edit: omg reddit we did it! Please visit r/dadgoals and start posting actions by dads that inspire you to be a better dad. (Let’s not be gender discriminatory though) plenty of moms are kick-ass dads too.
*sending internet hug*..........*hug delivered*
I’m a dad and a grandpa.  If you are cool with who you are, I am cool with who you are. Now get in here and get this big internet hug.
Part of the problem is that people immediately sexualize gay people and make it about the fuck-preference, rather than the love and bonding experience.   Imagine rejecting your kid after all that heart wrenching rearing, because they happen to fall in love with someone more like themself.  Edit: grammar
I guess I can almost understand if you literally believed you were trying to save your child from eternal damnation.  I can't fathom believing that though.
Religion is a hell of a drug
My mom is struggling with me being bi because she’s so religious. But in the end she knows she’ll be okay if I marry a woman and will love that woman as a daughter-in-law.  And yet it’s the most stressful, depressing thing I’ve gone through. And it’s one of the better-case scenarios. I can’t imagine the weight and trauma for kids whose parents don’t support them and kick them out.
Damn. I want a hug now
"Me and a few close guy friends have recently started saying ""love you"" when we say goodbye to each other and it's wild how nice it feels. Even said nonchalantly, it still reminds us just how close and supported we are"
Wait is that like a thermostat? Don't mess with that, money doesn't grow on trees
"""MTF Transgender? Fine, but WE are your parents so WE get to pick your name, Ethel"""
Hi Sad, a big virtual hug for you :) love, dad
My 50ish year old co-worker is planning on going to the pride parade this year and giving out mom hugs while wearing our company's pride shirt. She wants to get a group together, so while I'm not necessarily old enough to be a mom to the people at the parade, I'll probably go with and offer sister hugs instead.   I agree though, I hope this isn't a necessity when I'm old enough to be a mom. My mom was extremely understanding when I told her I'm bi (to the point where she just always assumed I was a lesbian and didn't give a shit), and I know I'm extremely lucky for that, so I'd love to be able to share a bit of that with others.
💕💕💕 thank u
I’ve always wondered though, if you wanted to guarantee that your child didn’t suffer eternally, wouldn’t it have been better never to have had them in the first place?
It's not even just religion. I was kicked out for being a lesbian when I was 17. Mum isn't religious, she's atheist, and I'm not gay. Some people are just ass holes and I honestly think some are just looking for a reason to just be done dealing with the thing they created.   It sucks it happens. I never formed a relationship with my mum. She was my only parent. When I broke up with my ex, she was pissed as she liked him and that was the last time we talked. I figured it would happen but it still sucked.
"I never came out (bi) to my parents. In fact I've ""come out"" to about 3 people. I don't know if I'll ever come out. I've had to move back in with my parents and they are helping me get in to trade school for a new career and if they knew that about me they'd drop all support and throw me out. I know they would because they said they would. So I will continue to date the opposite sex until they either pass, or no longer have any direct influence on the path of my life.   I grew up in a town where it was perfectly acceptable to have a Yes on 8 Sticker on your car and a baseball bat in the back seat *wink wink nudge*. So from early on I was taught it was wrong and disgusting. So naturally when I started developing sexually and becoming interested in other humans, I was confused, hurt, and terrified. ""People get hurt doing this, this can't be me"".  To this day I struggle with my own feelings and attractions because of how hard baked in to me all that hatred was. None of it remains for others. But I still struggle with myself. I hope some day I can escape this hell. But seeing as I'm going in to a job in construction, I doubt it. Because then I'll just have to hide from someone else.  Sorry. I don't know why, but I feel like this is a safe place to say this (on a throwaway, obviously). I can't wait to one day have the guts to go to Pride. It looks like such a wonderful event.  Edit: thank you all so much for your kind words. I am overwhelmed. I am in California to those who are asking. You all are beautiful, wonderful people."
*hugs*   I hope you and your mom get through this eventually. I’m sorry for the stress, I can’t imagine the kind of pain it must have caused for you.
"Man, I really wish that people understood how much their ""just because I disagree with them doesn't mean I hate them"" rhetoric is still harmful as shit."
Same boat as you. I'm Bi and my Mom ultimately accepts me, but she struggles with her religious views. She has tried to 'convert me back to God' a couple times through forced family interventions, whether this is fully over my being Bi or Agnostic, I don't know. I will say, she's at least very kind, just confused by the concept and sometimes insensitive.
I couldn’t even get the words out before I started bawling. I’m an only child and my parents and I are extremely close. I didn’t even have to say it. They knew, because they know me. They knew I was struggling and being secretive. They’d caught me sneaking out. It had caused a lot of tension and anxiety for them and for me.

And close the door, we're not heating the whole neighborhood.
You act like electricity just comes out of the wall or something!
im not part of the LGBTQ community and i will never be a mom, but i DO have a huge wingspan and ive been told i give good hugs.
Hey, no need to apologize for sharing your story and struggles. I'm sorry that there are people in your life stopping you from being yourself.   I hope someday you no longer have to struggle with these feelings and can embrace your own path. You deserve it. Thank you for sharing your story, it will always be important to share how being marginalized can affect people until we no longer feel it necessary to marginalize people.   Random strangers on the internet are rooting for you!
The tidbit about Prop 8 really brought back memories for me. I was fourteen and just figuring out my sexuality, and every time I saw Yes on 8 stuff (constantly, it felt like it was fucking everywhere) I would feel so alienated and scared. But it did make it pretty easy to figure out who would support me and who wouldn't! I'm lucky with my parents in that regard. When the neighbors across the street got a yes on 8 sign for their lawn, my parents let me put a no on 8 sign on our lawn! Man, prop 8 was such a load of shit.
Thanks for being so wholesome and giving out hugs and words of kindness.
Hers is more “Of course gay marriage and abortion and other stuff should be legal and I am not to judge cuz their lives are between them and God.... but my own kids better not be gay or have an abortion etc”  I also briefly worked at an abortion clinic. SORRY MOM.
Forced family interventions?! I am so sorry. That sounds like the quickest way for someone to begin building resentment towards God and religion. You are loved and you matter. ❤️

I'm proud of your dad! Please tell him I said he did an excellent job. I hope he uses the printers to print copies and just plasters them all over his building 😂
Obviously the other professors are so stressed they can't even appreciate the humor and effort. He did a great job
Now that’s the wholesomeness I need
A shame his colleagues didn’t give him the response he deserves. Your father truly memes well!
Want to hear a joke about paper? Never mind it's tearable. Great job from your dad, I bet his coworkers could never make the cut.   I'll see myself out.....
I genuinely find this funny
It’s a wonderfully dank meme
FYI, this was actually posted in /r/tumblr first by /u/alliandoalice. I just crossposted it here. Make sure to go give that person some love. Thanks! Here's their post: https://old.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/dks7n3/dads_first_meme/
Like... for real though. It’s actually a meme. And it’s actually funny.
It's a very funny thing he did, but the other professors are really probably reaching a peak point in stress. De-printerizing is fairly common around universities and research institutes nowadays. It's mostly covered as eco friendly action, but many times it is motivated by having to pay journals less money for access. When there are no printers the journal articles can only be accessed through the institute/uni network and cannot be exported to anywhere else since there are no printers and all data coming out of the network is monitored.   So yeah those professors really have something to be stressed about. It's not that big a deal, but from what I've seen some professors really do hide printers or smuggle them back in the facilities.
I bet these puns are a staple of your kind of humor. These ones just came whiteout of nowhere!
Thank you for the wholesome credit shout! I’m happy to upvote you both!  :D
Its critical we send upvotes there immediately
His co workers just aren’t smart enough to understand it. 10/10 meme.
It is a big deal. When you have to synthesize information from dozens or perhaps hundreds of sources, reading each individually on a screen isn't exactly optimal. The same thing happens when you are grading 50 papers that are 40 pages each. No way I'm grading those accurately if I'm scrolling through a pdf.
I'm admin in healthcare. Years ago when we went to a paperless electronic medical record system I witnessed an older MD rip his laptop in half because he couldn't figure it out. It took him a while but it was a glorious meltdown.   It was such a shitty roll out.
Mom putting on the subtle pressure for you to get kids o O.

1,000,000% more wholesome than rich dudes. I love you mom.
I felt that
"That's a lot better than what I wrote in my donation comment:  ""TREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"""
I hate how we have to crowdfund these types of issues. Kid gets cancer? The earth is on fire?  Taxes are the original crowdfunding mechanism and they're not utilized well here in the US.  Edit: bad words on wholesome content made me feel bad
*laughs in surgically removed tubes*
Lol, someone planted 1,000,001 trees just to beat Elon.
They could hit it like by the end of November. It's ridiculous. We just need viral campaigns like this for every major issue, and I'm serious. Mr. Beast could literally fully fund any good cause with his fan base, and it'd be good PR for him too.
I kind of like the donating competition.  Showing off your money in a great way.

Fun thing is they won't stop at 20 millions, they'll stop on January 1st 2020. Curious to see how big this will get.
As a dysfunctional, emotionally stunted gay myself, I can not laugh at this, only cry
I’m not really sure I want kids either but this sub is more like r/childhate
What’s shopify
They're not stopping on January 1st, either, just this specific campaign is. This is just a small part of a larger Arbor Day Foundation campaign to plant [100 million trees by 2022](https://timefortrees.org/). We're all gonna breathe SO WELL.

"I've read some Redditors call them ""men getting triggered over women"" and now that's what I read every time I see MGTOW."
"It's the reddit effect at least partially.  Some of these communities start out bad, but there are a ton that start off like little isolated nice support groups and in 12 months Horst-Wessel-Lied is playing full blast.   Like it's easy to see why people, at least some people in certain communities would want to participate in a sub like /r/childfree  Not having children is, in a lot of places, not really treated like a reasonable choice some people might make and others might not. Instead you get those people who think if you're not shooting out children from between your legs like a theme park waterslide there must be something wrong with you and treat you like some kind of weird lepper, which entails a lot of pity and peer pressure.    Not super endearing.    So of course there's going to be a core of people who are salty about that and want to reaffirm their choices since they have zero support in their daily lives.    However the inherent circlejerk nature of reddit communities tends to float the uh, ""passionate"" viewpoints to the top, and as any small community grows in size its prone to a situation like ""the summer that never ended"" where the original culture is subsumed by newcomers who are attracted by unusual stand out content that maybe didn't well-represent the community overall.    This especially seems to happen to ""men's rights"" communities or anything really remotely male-positive as misogynistic neo-nazi's seem to swarm from community to community like some kind of memetic locusts destroying any hope of sane conversation in their wake.   No small subculture is really safe from this though, and reddit really empowers/enables these takeovers in the absence of extremely strict moderation, and often even small hobby communities tend to become really toxic and infested with ads when they gain any popularity."
This is easily the best response I’ve seen yet. He shut down the gatekeeping aspect of her tweet without being caustic or petty. Pure wholesomeness. 
I thought you couldn't celebrate Lunar New Year unless you had a moon?
friendly reminder planetary movements don't belong to anyone, celebrate every day
This is 100% perfect
This is such a toxic sentiment. Attending New Year festivities is a valuable way to learn about other cultures. The Chinatown in the city where I live has one of the biggest events in Europe at the weekend - I just got back from it in fact. It's sponsored by local businesses and the local Football Club, endorsed by the City (who close off the streets), and attended by people of many races and faiths who come to celebrate with the Chinese/East Asian community and also happen to **spend a lot of money** at those businesses.      Although this Twitter person may have started out from good intentions, IMO all they're really doing is patronising members of the Asian community as if they don't have their own agency in these matters.
"""Friendly reminder"" translates to ""because I am a passive aggressive asshole"""
Ha about 7x the likes, serves her right i suppose.
Well well well.. how the tables have turned...
Any good excuse for a Steam sale amirite?
Petty shit like that on Twitter annoys me
Oh how the tables have tabled—   Guess you can’t celebrate Halloween unless you’re a Celt or invited by someone who’s Celtic. I don’t make the rules. 
Looked up the tweet and unsurprisingly she works for Buzzfeed
There’s a Buddhist temple near my city, every year there’s an open invitation for anyone to celebrate the new year with them. They’re over the moon if you’re there, if you wear the traditional clothing or eat the food. It’s so refreshing from the whole “cultural appropriation” stuff we see online. My Chinese students always say “Welcome to China” because they want people to experience their culture, they want you to wear their clothing and love their food, architecture, whatever. It’s super wholesome and they’re super enthusiastic. It’s adorable.   I love this. 
She's from BuzzFeed lol  And she wrote an article how Taiwan does Halloween better than anyone else   O K 👌  
Okay then. People who aren't Christian can't celebrate Christmas.
I like his face. It makes me smile. 
"I really hate this gatekeepers trying so hard to ""sympathize"" and act like offended in behalf of certain group. Here for example, people (locals) hate non-japanese people celebrate a japanese festival without knowing that the japanese community themselves organize the event to celebrate with the locals/people.  "
She works for buzzfeed, par for the course.
Is there a little bit of troll in starting it with the same phrasing that she did, though?  Not complaining, just curious.
People really need to learn the difference between cultural appropriation and celebration of a different style of living. It’s 2019 people. 
Oh I suck at reading twitter I read it bottom up. This makes much more sense.   That bottom up happens all the time too right? Idk twitters UI is just so confusing to me. 
What if I don't have a moon but I have a fully operational death star?

You're 100% perfect!
"My soon-to-be husband is Chinese, I am white. I've been told more then 3 or 4 times now (by white people, generally) that my celebration of Chinese New Year with his family is ""cultural appropriation."" My explanations that a) marrying him makes me family and b) if I don't attend his family will unbelievably offended often falls on deaf ears.."
It’s just incomprehensible to me. What if the person is living in that country but hasn’t been “formally invited” by someone? I was in China for three years and don’t think I ever had hat happen, but you bet your ass I enjoyed the fireworks and festivities.   Holidays are for celebrating, I feel like they all tend to be pretty inclusive. “It’s 4th of July and you’ve been in the US for two weeks? Come drink beer and watch fireworks with us, it’ll be awesome!”
As an American of 100% Chinese ancestry, I would be unable to celebrate Chinese New Year according to the rules established by this tweet because I’m not from China.
True, except when it doesn't.
/r/gatekeeping
Still sad she got that many likes. Hard to believe people actually agree with that exclusive, divisive rhetoric
How the turntables indeed...
There was a steam sale? Shit! 
"> Racism under the guise of antiracism  That's really what it is IMO. I've never understood the notion of cultural appropriation because it's literally saying ""you can't do that because of your ethnic background"" ... how can you support a multicultural society that accepts everyone and at the same time demand that every group *has to* stick to their own customs. You're essentially asking for segregation, bitch. "
>~~Petty shit like that on~~ Twitter annoys me  
You also cant celebrate Christmas unless invited by Jesus or are a Christian.... Or an elf. Sorry dont make the rules
Wow, not surprised. BuzzFeed is complete trash.
Yeah there’s for sure a bit of sass there, mocking the original tweet a little bit. But it’s not at all hateful, that’s what I appreciate. 
I like to believe that unlike the person on top, his reminder is actually friendly.
That’s no moon...
That's rough buddy
Now this is pod racing
no u
The idea of cultural appropriation is a joke to begin with.
"Dont explain anything.  Just tell them ""eat shit"" and go have fun anyways."
> I've been told more then 3 or 4 times now  You need to elevate your company. Cut some of that shit out of your life.
Can you imagine the outrage if this sort of gatekeeping logic were applied to the Fourth of July? The resulting bevy of xenophobic accusations would be awe-inspiring.
They don't think it be like that, but it do. Except when it don't. 
It's all the people that try to take cultural sensitivity and wear it as a badge of superiority. Leave it to people to figure out a way to turn being respectful into something disrespectful lol
Ends tomorrow, you still got time.
Cultural appropriation is real but people (usually teenage tumblr users) misinterpret it. It applies to things that are sacred or have exclusive value to a culture.  Cultural appropriation: if the Chinese started to wear giant gold christian rosaries around their necks as a fashion statement. To the christians, a rosary is something sacred that should be used for prayer, so it would be cultural appropriation to wear it in a way that doesn't respect its original culture.  Cultural appropriation: if people in Indonesia started to make replica purple hearts (military badges for those killed in service) as a fashion statement to wear on their coats. It would be cultural appropriation because a purple heart badge is something that has intrinsic cultural meaning to Americans that shouldn't be disgraced.  NOT cultural appropriation: if Koreans started wearing backwards baseball caps, football jerseys and khakis. This is a distinctly American fashion, but it is not something exclusive or sacred -- it is something that is meant to be shared.  NOT cultural appropriation: wearing sombreros, kimonos, dreadlocks, etc. Anyone who tells you that wearing a kimono is cultural appropriation is either very ignorant, very stupid, or acting maliciously. 
>Petty shit ~~like that on Twitter~~ annoys me
I mean the traditions are pagan absolutely. And yes it was place at that time frame to help convert people. But it still is a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus. 
"I read that as ""a bit of sauce"""
Yeah if you look at the history of r/wholesomememes these are the kind of memes the sub was created for. I don't mind that it has changed, but originally it was for memes that lift people up... but still usually had a meme-y bite to them.
This raises an interesting question though, if the death star is orbiting a planet, would it experience the same phases as a moon would? 
Why not everyone?  *except Twitter op*
In principle it makes sense - don't take revered cultural elements out of context and use them for your own gain/amusement.  But learning/celebrating new traditions and cultures is not inherently taking them out of context, damn. 
*Real* redditors would click that link though
"What I find funny is, that it is often children of immigrants(Asian-Americans etc) who complain while the actual people from the countty are like ""heck yeah join in"""

Begrudgingly. 
I used to feel a bit that way, until I went to the Native American Museum at the Smithsonian when visiting the US recently (am from Aus). I learned about the meaning behind the chieftain's headdress (that classic feathered one). Each feather is gifted to the chieftain for an act of great meaning, sacrifice, bravery, or achievement. The headdress is a monument to a great and noble life, with each feather having individual significance. It's a symbol of greatness and deserving of respect. Now cut to the next room in the museum, and there's a picture of that headdress being worn by a near naked Victoria's Secret model on the runway as a means to sell lingerie. I suddenly very much understood how the cultural appropriation of that item for fashion, burning man etc would be so upsetting. Now I try to remember that when I see aspects of other cultures being adopted outside the culture - often it's fine (and even celebrated), but some things hold a very special and revered place in a culture and should be treated with much more care and respect.   **Edit**: Couldn't recommend that museum highly enough by the way - it was a highlight of our time in DC.

Good job to the kid as well for knocking on those doors and trying to get to school... he will do well. 
"I absolutely love the phrase ""say no more fam""."
That was kind of that man.
This kind of perspective to me, illustrated the closet concept of community parenting. When one of us realizes that our success is interdependent and that the success of our youth is insurance for our future. It demonstrates the truest form of neighborhood.   This is a perspective that I have I only seen in marginalized communities, queer, Jewish, Muslim, POC. A sense of throwing one's lot in with another. Of a need to mutually support each other because we are aware that our lives are precious; we live in  the face of overwhelming violence and oppression.    TLDR: shit's woke
Gotta rock the foams for the big plays. 
As a teacher in an inner city school the fact that some kids legit don't have rides to school in the morning makes me want to drive the bus as well. 
"You know these type of students are gonna make a difference in the world. They're actually pursuing an education, wanting to better themselves. If I had missed my bus, I would have just thought, ""Shoot. Guess no school for me today."" And take a nice little walk back home. I look up to these kind of people. "
Peppering kindness, MY MAN!
Got there before the school bus even (according to the reflection in the mirror). 
This made me burst out laughing and I don't know why.
This is one of those things that could affect that kid for the rest of his life. Maybe because someone helped him in a time of need, maybe because he'd made the decision he was going to try to make it to school that day - and he *did*, maybe because that was a day where he learned something that interested him enough to pursue it when he grew up. Right on.
Y'all saying he got drive to go to school. I agree but I know for a fact  the ass whooping he was going get was in the back of his mind. Nothing was worse than building up the courage to wake moms outta bed. 
Is no one going to talk about the fact how incredibly dangerous it is for a kid to knock on random doors and asking strangers for a drive to school 
Neighbor of the year right here. 
...and then the school secretary made some snide, under-handed, sh-tty remark about him being late, as did his 1st period teacher.  Source: Work in an inner-city school.  Hear it all the time from adults who don't know their students' realities.
ALSO the emphasis on the importance of oral hygiene 
He's got drive that's for sure
That's admirable. He wants to learn and isn't taking no for an answer 
Especially after facing rejection 3 times. By the 3rd I think, sadly, I would have given up at that age. 
If he wouldnt ,his momma would have kicked his ass for missing ..
He was lucky. It could have worked out very badly for him.
SAY NO MORE FAM...
I don't usually pick up and use the terms the younger generations use but I love that one.   I gotchu fam
No need to speak further, family.
I experienced something similar once. I just lost my bus as I was running for it. Some dude with a truck saw it go down and stopped at the bus stop and told me he saw what happened offered me a ride. I remember I was a bit on edge at the time but it was 30 mins or something until the next bus would come and I'd have to pay for that with money I couldn't really use for that at the time.  Anyways, I jump in and sure enough he gives me a ride. The school was on top of a hill too and I told him he could just drop me off at the bottom due to the difficult roads for a truck to pass. He refused and drove me all the way up to the school, wished me a great day at school and drove off never to be seen again.  Just gotta love people that are genuinely trying to help people that selflessly. It probably took 30-45 mins off of his route to get me to school. I still think back on it from time to time as a reminder that I can always do better for the people around me.
I agree, it was.
"I wish more people thought about helping others succeed as well as themselves. I can't talk to much, i haven't done much of that kind of stuff outside friends and family, but i would like to think i'd have the same reaction as this man.     It just seems like people are so mean, lack empathy for strangers, and don't care about others a lot. I just can't bring myself to actively not give a shit about people. That's also not to say i haven't done things like somewhat ignore a woman coming up to me and asking for money. I was in a city that is known to be rough and i was broke anyway waiting for a train, i just could muster up a ""sorry gotta go"" and ran to the train as it came up. I'm no saint. But then theres the opposite spectrum of people that actively try to make others feel bad, and that i don't understand.  Hell i don't even know what the point of this post was! But yeah."
Part of my childhood was spent in an upper class white neighborhood, and the kids were constantly transferring between houses, arriving unexpectedly, getting rides, etc.  I agree that this sentiment is one of the best aspects of human nature.  I don't think it's limited to marginalized groups.
subtle flex on the youth
wtf are foams? Flip flops?   I'm elderly. 
"As a country, we need far better public transport and infrastructure in general, its non existent in some places. I was one of the only kids in my high school that didn't have a car, and usually the attitude is ""sucks for you"". I had to walk 30 minutes to school constantly. I started to miss so much school senior year that I had to take online classes my second semester. My town barely even had sidewalks. "
Even if they don't make a difference in the world, every kid should receive an equal shot at education.
Uh... schools have more than one bus.
Hi there, I have my PhD in funny studies.  I have come up with this equation to help you understand.  (w + f)F = X  w = wholesome, f = funny, F = the amount of typical facebook influence, X = the hilarity level of the situation.  The amount of wholesome is definitely 90.  The amount of funny this post provides (without influence of facebook) would be about 45.  The the amount of typical facebook post influence is about 100.  (90 + 45)100 = 13,500  This post has a hilarity level of 13,500, which is above the typical average of 9000.  So yes, it's hilarity level is over 9000.
What kind of shit neighbors do you have?
Well, technically, you had the drive
Please tell me BDNICK is Big Dick Nick?
It certainly could be, and let's assume it is in this subreddit, but he may have just thought/known he'd get in trouble for missing school
He got the expected result. He'd have been incredibly unlucky for this to have worked out badly.  This is sort of a pet peeve for me. Saying someone got lucky for achieving the expected result because the incredibly rare result is bad. You're not lucky when the odds of the bad outcome are very low, that's just expected odds.  E.g. Just because I hitch hiked across the country doesn't mean I got lucky that I never got robbed, it would have been unlucky if I did. 
"""Dude...you're not even gonna brush your teeth?"""
You sound 50
Further commentary is not required, relative.
That is so sweet! A offered me a ride to school once when she saw me miss the bus as well. I, a fucking delinquent, turned her down and just skipped school with the excuse that I missed the bus...    but still, nice lady 
i always think about doing this when i see people waiting in the cold at bus stops  but like im 6'2 with a big beard and i don't want to come across as creepy
Foamposites. Very comfy, very expensive, very ugly. I have a pair that I regret buying. lol
I had to walk 30 mins to school everyday also. I never missed school unless I was sick. We don't have school buses in Queens as far as I know.  They did give us half fare metro cards for the city buses though but that $1 a ride added up quick so I never used it.
 I think he may have been joking. 
Why can't they both have the drive?
That is exactly what it is
Caring about getting in trouble for missing school isnt too far from caring about school in general, especially in the context of high school where even successes in the making tend to view it as just something you need to do for college/jobs/whatever.
>Saying someone got lucky for achieving the expected result because the incredibly rare result is bad.  I wish you didn't say this because now this is going to be my new pet peeve also
SAY NO MORE FAM
Close....27
Additional exposition is deemed extraneous, consanguineous human.
The dude that picked me up was probably around 6'x with a big beard and came off as creepy. But that's on me though for judging before anything else, I caught myself thinking like that, shrugged it off and stepped inside his truck. He talked to me, was nice about it all and made sure I felt safe while driving to the destination. Nicest dude ever, don't sell yourself short because you're afraid of what other people may think. And if they do think in those lanes it's on them, not you. :)
"I walked however I think that once I reached senior year, I lost motivation and I had pretty bad depression due to overall being neglected by my parents (distance between school and work and my house and all that walking gave me no free time at all compared to my friends which also played a huge part). I just remember being pissed when all these rich kids would call me ""lazy"" for showing up late to school when I walked, these kids got fancy cars for their 16th birthdays. "
I presumed he meant more than one bus for each area of the town
There can only be one drive. If another emerges, they must fight to the death.   No, wait, I'm thinking of highlanders.
So wholesome
The people I knew who didn't care about school definitely didn't care enough to make that kind of effort to get to class, even to avoid punishment. They would've just shrugged and stayed home. Missing the bus is an easy excuse.

Later that night his actual girlfriend picks him up.
I like the one where he goes in the bathroom and rings her up saying somebody is trying to sleep with him, only its her, because shes his girlfriend.
what if he has another gf and it is not directed at her
I slapped my ex for kissing me while drunk. I didn't realize it was him, and I yelled that I had a bf, threw up, and fell into bed. High school was something else.   Explaining the hand mark on his face to his mother was a hoot
I did this but then crawled into bed and immediately wet myself
This just means he has another girlfriend
commitment 100
"I have a buddy that got smashed and went to his baby Mama's house. They smashed and then he started getting dressed to leave. She told him to spend the night and he said ""I can't. I need to go home because I have to go pick up my son in the morning from his mom. "" And then left"
Imagine having a girl/boyfriend
Unless...he has a side piece
“That guy is full blown D.E.N.N.I.S.-ing you and you don’t even know it!”
I do the reserve of this and pretend I’m not living with my girl. I just walk up and ask her if she will come home with me in front of random people.
Bro, how smashed were you bro?
When you thought she was the side piece but it was you all along...
His wife actually picked him up when dropping off their kids at their aunts
I like the one where he comes home drunk and she tries to help him undress but he says to go away cuz hes got a girlfriend

Talk about championing a cause! I’m proud of him.
For a second there i thought that was Kevin Malone. 
"While what he's done is awesome, this post isn't really the truth: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kutcher-software-child-trafficking/  Just let this be another lesson that you really should be skeptical when you take in any information that's given to you in such a small block of text on a social media post.    But kudos to Ashton *and Demi* for their efforts (she really shouldn't be forgotten in this).  Edit: To those replies making it seem like I'm discounting his efforts, that's simply not the case.  I'm just saying that this short post isn't completely accurate and completely ignores the fact that Demi Moore was involved in this effort as well.  Not to mention, it implies that this all happened within the past year (the ""man of the year"" label) and that's completely inaccurate.  However, his initiative is great and I commend him for it."
I like to believe that this was his goal his entire life and his acting career was just a stepping stone so that he could fund this
From dude where's my car to dude I found your daughter
Imagine how much better place the world would be if powerful men were trying to save vulnerable young people instead of having sex with them. He is one of the good ones.
I’m pretty sure this wasn’t why his acting career slowed down. But kudos for making positive use of his time.
I think his best interview is when he responds to the question of why he doesnt go back to his day job of acting.
So real story: this guy was at my house repairing something while I was watching reruns of That 70’s Show and I started talking him about it.  Turns out his daughter had passed a couple years before from cancer and Ashton had been pen pals with her through the whole thing. The repairman said every time he sees Ashton now he thinks about how he made his daughter a little happier and it makes him feel more connected to his daughter.  I think about him every time I watch one of those shows now and I think it’s beautiful 
Goddamn I want him to fuck me.  No homo
Great job Kevin!
I’m not sure why, but just reading child sex slave and knowing that it’s a real thing and happening right now genuinely sent shivers down my spine   Edit: Didn’t mean to upset anybody. I just meant it more so as reading the words “child sex slave” and knowing that it’s not some plot to a movie or tv show and actually happening. The reality of it just smacked me in the face. My bad 
Biggest green flag that someone is a good person
Ugh... To be honest this attitude being so common in this sub really annoys me. The simple fact is he could have a much bigger impact by publicizing the hell out of it and trying to inspire even 0.0001% of his fans to take up the cause...
He did, he had a press conference or spoke at some event. But I guess the media only cares if a celebrity is going to rehab or has a Taylor Swift song written about them. 
I wonder what his thoughts are on the allegations against Hyde

Ashton Kootcher
Identified 6000 and thus rescued 130, still tremendous.
So his software has helped identify 6000 victims, and rescue over 100 of them.  Sounds like a win to me.
Maybe he knew of a girl or girls it happened to growing up? Who knows. Good guy Ashton tho
He's a genius (seriously look it up), he now plays the market as he sits in his underwear, in the next room Mila is playing WoW in her undies as well...  I would literally kill for his life..   
Same. Full homo here. 
Frankly it should.  I was recently exposed to a mother trying to rescue her daughter from these monsters. If you suspect someone is being trafficed for labor or sex, check for state and local resources. The ones I found were though our state's DoT, or local family service office. There is also a national hotline. 
Probably because it’s fucked up. 
There are no limits to human depravity. None. 
I've been studying the Renaissance era and child sex slaves were happening for the rich back then. With the same allegations going on right now I'm guessing this has been a thing throughout human existence. 
If you really want to be nauseous look up Bachi Bazi. Child sexual slavery is repugnant and occurs in first world countries like this  in the US or the grooming gangs in England, so extrapolate that to 3rd world countries and it will ruin your day. In fact, maybe dont look those things up and go hug your kids instead.
https://www.thorn.org/about-our-fight-against-sexual-exploitation-of-children/
It goes to the cost of labor to help people search for children.
He should team up with Keanu and save the world.
Nah, idgaf if someone tells everyone how much good he/she is doing as long as they’re doing it. Doing good and bragging about it is much better than just not doing good. 
There's an interesting tension between using your platform for good and making it about you. I don't really follow celebrity news but I think his testimony to Congress was televised, which probably was a bigger deal because of his fame. I'm not sure what he has or hasn't done in regards to trying to get others on board, but it seems like it's a real, personal project for him, not a media stunt, and I think that's more what people mean.
"I just picture Ashton running up in a trucker hat hugging ""little_kid_lover_69"" you just been Punk'd!"
I just wish I had the time and money to do something like this. Unfortunately I don’t.  But I can help raise awareness, I suppose.
"Well, yeah, that's why I said ""what he's done is awesome""  But we should probably give Demi her credit too and this post excludes her completely.  Just look at the title being used on this thread."
Which would be more reason not to lie to make it sound better. Still wholesome though. 
Mila hasn’t played WoW in years. The last thing she said about was in an interview saying she quit because it’s too addicting
He doesn't just invest and donate. He runs the place. Daily. It's what he *does* now
https://youtu.be/DOc-SjcR6Eo  I apologised it was his statements to the senate not an interview and he makes the statements around 2:20
>plenty of much worse shit  Yeah I dunno about that. Child sex slavery is pretty fucking high on the list of horrible acts
The hell do you think they're doing? 
Kutcher/Reeves 2020.  You heard it here first.
I still remember when Seth Rogen went to Congress for Alzheimer's research and no one listened https://youtu.be/hvdbHSGWAgs
Hyde is a Scientologist, there’s like 5 or 6 women (also Scientologists) saying he pretty much Cosby’d them.  One said she woke up in the middle of it and Hyde choked her til she passed back out and when she woke up again he was gone.  The higher ups in Scientology are supposedly stopping it from really getting out.
Hyde is a Scientologist and aggressive asshole 
... oh you're right, they just wouldn't publicize it.
Is Kutcher even 35??  Wow I just googled it he’s 40, I thought he was still like 30
That is very sad to hear.
I really hope his brother (Chris) isn't the same kind of psycho Danny is, I always loved Francis (Malcolm in the Middle) more than Hyde. 
Yeah that's our job.
Naw dog, he went to high school in the 70s. Must be almost 60 by now!
"Take it with a grain of salt. Seriously. Scientologists are total assholes and aren't above lying about someone if he acted out against the ""religion""."
Well he's a Scientologist too. 
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/danny-masterson-scientology-critics-you-772814  This should be good enough.  He was born into a Scientology family and has told critics to fuck themselves and said criticizing Scientology is akin to criticizing Judaism 
Are we just going to ignore Liam Neeson or what?
But he didn’t. They’re covering it up for him. 
Oh , great.      Check, please! 
He has been filmed running over rooftops to retrieve a girl who had been taken...
I'm just saying I don't trust scientology. That is all. For all I know he could have done something and this was the lesser of two penalties and now he supports the religion again so that they don't put the other penalty on him too.  Either way, unless I have to deal with him directly, then I honestly don't care, but I'm not gonna put any faith in stories that come from scientologists, especially if they make someone look bad, that is what they do.

"I saw Bill Gates Sr. often when I was a student at the University of Washington - yes, he's really that tall.   He was on the board of regents. There are buildings named after him and his wife, Mary, whom he met in 1949. At closing of our student union building in 2010, he talked about hanging out with her there, and she was wearing her cheerleading outfit.  I always wanted to get a picture with him before I graduated. And while waiting for my friends outside Husky Stadiun on Commencement Day, I happened to spot him in the crowd (not that hard).    ""Mr. Gates!""    He stopped in his tracks, turned around and asked ""yes?""    ""Could I get my picture taken with you?""    ""Sure, but make it quick.""  I asked the woman next to me to take our picture. Afterward, he congratulated me and continued on his way. The woman who took our picture asked, ""who was that?""  ""Bill Gates' dad,"" I replied.  *edit*   Here's the pic https://imgur.com/fl0MUdF"

Being very tall or very short both have a lot of down sides. From finding clothes that fit your body, to fitting comfortably in standard sized spaces. There are sometimes a slew of health risks that are either the cause of, or caused by being very tall or very short. Truthfully, for an easy, safe, and happy life it's best to be average. Never take being average for granted.
Every time he jumps a chair, he imagines he's as tall as his dad who would be able to walk over it.
I don’t know about Bill Gates and his personal taxes, but Microsoft—like many companies—is well known to take advantage of legal but arguably ethically questionable means of financial offshoring to avoid paying billions in corporate taxes.  A couple takes on the matter:  https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/how-microsoft-parks-profits-offshore-to-pare-its-tax-bill/  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/06/bill-gates-preaches-fighting-poverty-hypocrite-microsoft-tax

yoda baby is adorable, I must upvote
"This is exactly what my 7 year old does. I work from home for part of the week and she'll just stand in the doorway of my office until I finish, and when I ask what's up, she just says, ""uhhhh, I love you"" and runs off. It's really going to break my heart when she stops doing that."
Love you, I do
For cigarettes he went, come back he will
I legit can’t even focus on the show because of how cute he is.
My 8 month old son finally has mastered this crawling to get specific things. Last night I was working in my study and my wife comes home, she comes and says hi and I give them both a kiss. I'm trying to wrap up work before dinner so I can focus on my family. I hear my son crawling in the the hallway and look up just in time to see his tiny little head poke in my doorway with the biggest smile. He then starts crawling over to me, pulls himself up on my pants legs and then gives me this look. Needless to say I was done with work for the night after that.
I’ve only known Baby Yoda for a week, but if anything happened to him, I would kill everyone in this thread and then myself.
I hope they finally give this species a name it's weird calling him baby yoda
I'm turning 27 so I edited a 2 in front of the 7 and sent it to my dad. He loves star wars.
This is the best one so far
He's basically a Mogwai
So is he actualy yoda and is this a prequel or not? (I dont watch the mandolorian because i dont have dinsney+)
"Start doing it for her, stand in her doorway and say ""uhhh, I love you"" in the same way"
"My 5 year old son interrupts us all the time as if he's got something urgent to say and usually just says ""I love you."" While we want him to learn interrupting is bad. . .we also don't want him to stop the sporadic I love yous.  So, here we are, in a bind."
\*abruptly eats a frog whole\*
Hopefully will not take 15 years, he won't.
It's actually kind of a problem. He's usurped the top spot from the character that the show is named after!
I struggle even watching the show I’m so worried about  baby yoda being okay.  I am already aggressively attached this adorable little one and if anything happens to him in the show I’ll be sick.  He’s just to fucking cute and that galaxy is so dangerous, I get crazy anxiety anytime he’s in danger.  Not sure a show or movie has ever gotten that emotion out of me.  The mandolorin had better be willing to do whatever it takes to make sure no harm befalls that little bundle of overwhelming cuteness.
He’s cuter
SPOILERS:  It's not a prequel, since it takes place after the fall of the Empire. Still inconclusive whether it's a baby of Yoda's race, or a Yoda clone (all we know is that the child is highly sought after, has force sensitivity, and is 50 years old).
And run off quickly
Spit that out
Thems fightin' words!
> is 50 years old  WHAT
The scientist that wanted the baby has a patch on his arm that has the Kamino cloning logo on it. The same division that made the Clone Troopers.
...giggling and then begging to put on Frozen again.
Species age differently. He will live to ~900.
Yoda was 900 when he died, so they age pretty slowly
Well good news is it’ll finally stop being Frozen soon.   The bad news is it’ll be Frozen 2

I'm 23, currently taking care of my 15 year old sister and 5 year old brother. He's in desperate need of new shoes, and I can barely afford food for all of us at the moment. 
What an amazing offer!   Single mother of 2 here. Have been on medical leave since January due to an ankle injury/surgery. Not a whole lot of money coming in. Would love to be able to treat my kids to something special to thank them for all the help they've given me. 
That's a phenomenal offer. You're a gem.  I'm expecting my first baby in a month, and I'm not covered by any kind of paid leave, so this would be an amazing help. 
That's quite impressive ! Good job. Sugar is super addictive, it's not easy to break the cycle, even more when it's a habit to have soda everyday.

I literally just posted about this problem.   Alas I have therapy and so far it's no help.
This page has been more useful to my depression than subbing to r/depression. If you are depressed, dont sub to r/depression - it will only make you feel worse.
I’ve come to realize in my 30s that keeping depression at bay is a constant active effort. My baseline is to go into a depressive “don’t leave the house” mode.   It’s like pushing yourself to go to the gym on a regular basis when you hate going.   In the end you feel better, but you need to keep maintaining. You can’t take a passive role in dealing with depression.   You always have to fight against that instinct to let everything go, and some days are easier than others.
I'll be dead by 35  Smoking a pack a day for 13 years is catching up to me  Hopefully since I quit fentanyl I live longer
I do something similar when I can’t sleep and become frustrated by it. I remind myself that in the morning when it’s time to get up, I’ll be jealous of the current me who still has eight hours of sleep ahead of me. It makes falling asleep a lot more comfy if you pretend you’re sleeping in
Good for you for diverting your energy and focus on yourself. You’re a better woman because of it. So proud and happy for you!
This is the healthiest reaction that I've ever seen on Reddit.  I teared up reading this.  You are doing an amazing job.
You gotta change who you hang out with.. A change of scene is the best move I've seen friends make. Start fitness and set goals. And always associate that drug with feeling like shit. You can do this!!! 
that's honestly how i'm able to say no to it. it DOES make me feel like shit. the scary part about meth is that it slowly robs your soul without you even realizing it.   i also plan to start a fitness series ASAP. tryna get people to hop on the self-care wave 😁
Your willpower is admirable
Where do you work?
For now I'm working at Walmart, but I found the bag in a speedway bathroom(ironic I know).
Bonus reward: There's always the chance that the contents of that bag had adulterants that could fuck you up in a variety of ways (or kill you), and now you don't have that risk :)
Too true! So much of the stuff these days is cut with everything from fentanyl to dangerous(if IVed) numbing agents. You can never be too careful. I feel like I gained my own trust back today.
THIS is exactly what I was searching for! If you don’t mind me asking, what and how brought you this break through?   Really wishing you the best on your new found self xo
Great work and I'm glad that these steps were enough for you to get your life back.    But unfortunately, these steps are impossible undertakings for most people who have major depression (or any other serious mental illness).    Six years ago I stopped brushing my teeth because the thought of getting out of bed to wet my toothbrush *overwhelmed me*. This is not an exaggeration (and I have the seven root canals to prove it). So if someone told me they overcame their depression and then listed the steps above... It would be discouraging to me.    Just reading the first one would have made me feel like a failure. I couldn't even handle basic hygiene let alone apply for a job and hope that it's a good one.    And I certainly didn't do it all on my own, I wound up in a partial hospitalization treatment program for 90 days. And that program taught me two main things: 1. I will have a major mental illness for the rest of my life. That is a fact that will never change.  2. The only thing I can change is how I treat it and live with it day-to-day.    My first treatment goal wasn't to end a long term relationship or find a job or join a gym.   It was to get out of bed and sleep on my couch because at least then I got out of bed.   That's how I rebuilt my life. Small, manageable tasks.    I'm not trying to discount your experience by any means. Anyone who finds a way out of their depression deserves praise and recognition.    I just need people who are overwhelmed by just reading your story to know there's still hope.    I'm a full-time graduate student with a career, a social life, and hobbies. And there are still days when I can't get out of bed—though they are few and far between.  And it's because one day I got out of bed and slept on my couch.  If signing up for a gym membership is too much for you, there's still hope.   Again, not trying to discount your story—just trying to reach more people.
"Hi @iSmokedItAll - Awesome, I'm so glad you found me and my story. I don't mind you asking at all! When I say I ""scratched and clawed,"" I truly mean that. I did not wake up one day and want to change. There was no catalyst that made me suddenly start improving. I didn't drink iowaska and suddenly have all the answers. I scratched and clawed for years. The way I picture it, the best way I can explain it is: the little girl inside of me - that girl I used to be when I was 18 years old, before everything went downhill for me - she was always somewhere hiding under layers and layers of trauma, self-loathing, and sadness. She was constantly being drowned out by a vicious internal monologue. But she was still there, undeniably the smallest of the voices in my head, but she never quite extinguished. And she knew the formula to get out. Because I think we all secretly know it, right? Get a job. End that problematic relationship. Exercise. Find hobbies. Clean your room. We know this is the key, but it's not always easy to do these things when you truly DON'T want happiness for yourself because you hate yourself so fucking much. But I did (begrudgingly) allow my body to go through these robotic motions over time - even though my voices were mocking me while I did these motions. Robotic motions of putting in job applications, typing out the words that would end my relationship, driving to an interview. Going on to Yelp to find a local gym. Putting in my credit card. Voices still mocking me. Packing a gym bag. Going to the gym. Running for 10 minutes. Voices ridiculing me. Calling a local improv class. Going through the items in my room and getting rid of half. Telling friends and family I would be embarking on a month of sobriety, which led to another and another. I could feel the voices telling me I didn't deserve any of it, but I robotically did it for some reason - I think if we let our subconscious self that KNOWS the formula to wellness - to sort of robotically guide us into taking tiny little wellness steps amidst all of our dominating pain and destruction - eventually those little positive steps turns into BIG wins. BIG Fucking wins. Monumental happiness. I'm getting chills thinking about human resiliency.   TLDR: Let the 2% of you that's still positive, still feeding you the formula to happiness, let him/her have small wins. Let him/her guide you into signing up for one painting class. Go to one gym session. Etc. Over time, he'll/she'll absolutely fucking conquer and you won't even know how you got to where you are."
Adulthood occurs when for gifts you begin asking for things you need rather than things that you want.

These are all good points everyone has but adulthood really occurs when it’s dinner time and you’re close to fast food but you think “nah, I’ve got food at home”. 
Proper sleep is so underrated! I can manage to power through my daily tasks after a night or two of poor sleep, but I'm a less sharp and more cranky version of myself. I much prefer being well rested and happy, even if I sometimes have to be the loser who goes to bed at 8:30.

Getting up at 7am instead of 12pm is a fucking game changer.

Best decision of my life (no brainer), you can do this homie, you will thanking yourself in a few months when you actually have money(or more money than u have now) and don't depend on a substance to get you to sleep, eat, or be normal.
And if you get up late thats okay. 7 am, 8am. its all good. the important thing is you went
I like the analogy of sadness, and any other emotion really, being like a wave on the sea. Stand in the sand, let the wave crash, and let it recede. It's only a moment.

Todays date meant absolutely nothing to me until I read this. Thanks, OP!
What if you are someone like that?
I think you should work on trying to become more aware of it as the negative words are passing your lips, so you can stop saying yourself from saying them later. Then start to notice when your thinking those negative thoughts (which I know, is probably all the time... it's not easy to change the way you think) and work on thinking more productively.  Good change starts with awareness!
I really needed this right now. Cannot get motivated:(
Wow, this is badass.

"Hey, this is great! I grew up in a ""complaining-as-communication"" household and it took a while to break off old habits but holy fuck, I was *so* much happier when I wasn't bringing myself down every time I opened my mouth.  And I discovered two great things once I'd really cut down on the complaining. The first was that other people started to want me around more, and were more willing to spend time with me, but the second was that I actually kind of liked myself. When I wasn't being negative all the time, it left space for me to be funny and be kind. The difference was huge and it definitely changed my life for the better. I'm so glad you're on the road to a more positive relationship with the world."
I remember a great story I heard a long time  ago, Julia Roberts was filming Steel Magnolias.  She said it was hot and steamy weather and everyone was sitting around and complaining, the whole cast was miserable.  Then she came across Dolly Parton, who was also in the cast, she was not only not complaining but was down right happy, perky and singing not even showing any discomfort .  Julia asked her how she could look so fresh when everyone else was miserable  and she said I have waited my whole life to be a movie star why would I waste it complaining, I am happy!   For some reason that story always stuck with me,   it is always a choice, how you feel and you act

I’m guessing your dad is the younger brother.

Aww! It looks like they have a great relationship despite the time apart. Many manly tears will be shed over beers tonight!

I made a surprise visit to one of my old Marine buddies about a year ago.  I hadn't seen him in over 12 years.  I quite literally showed up on his doorstep one day and his responses went something like this.   Aww man, what the fuck, fuck you you fucking asshole, dude I missed you so much, you're a dick, awe man this is great, I hate surprises,hugs, fuck all you guys for not telling me, I've thought about you every day, you're a son of a bitch.... this carried on for a solid 10 minutes until he calmed down a bit.    It was honestly the most touching and emotional experience I've ever had.  Dude was literally a brother to me for years.  We did everything together.

When the music kicked in, I really wanted the camera to pan over to a guy playing piano in the middle of the parking lot.
Getting older sucks because in your head you still feel things you felt many years ago but your body limits you from being that way again. That day that guy was 50 years younger. What a priceless gift. 
Um I think you’ve taken enough pictures already sheesh...    but other wise this is lovely (:
His eyes. Holy shit. The way his eyes light up. It’s like he literally got into a time machine and was young again.   This whole thing I beautiful and I am so happy that this video exists. 
I’m imagining a movie scene where as soon as the dad turned that car over and heard that rumble he instantly morphed into his bad and cool, handsome and young self again. 😭😭😭
The way he smiled when he revved it up. 
I hope I’ll be able to do something like this for my dad one day. 
Dang it! Why are my eyes leaking? 😭 Very cool story.
Geez, you can tell right away why everyone loves him so much. I hope he felt like a kid for a while.

"""What is this?... what is this...?"" Silance. Priceless."
Bunch of Owen Wilson’s around when he was telling his stories. “Wow, WOW, wOw, WOw, woW”
This was really cool until the music kicked in. Then it felt artificially sad and ruined the whole thing. 
The sad music ruined it.
Why the fuck are paparazzi there and taking pics of him? 
There was no bad paint on his original car. The dealer fucked up something big and it took them two weeks to replace the vehicle without him knowing 
enough already!! 
>he is not her real dad, >and her raiser like she was his own and he didn’t have to  Sounds like a real dad to me. 
Dude, I was doing very well, keeping it together, and then you sucker-punch me with *this?*
The way he talked about the car before he realized what was up was great. 40 years later, and he still remembered what day of the week he bought it. If that's not love, I don't know what is.
Ladies and gentleman, this specimen here is a real man. A role model for all of us.
As someone who was adopted by my mom's boyfriend at a very young age, this had me crying like a baby. I always wanted to do something like this for him but he died very suddenly my senior year of high school.   Hoo, the feels. 
Just some rando making their way downtown
Yeah, the music was melodramatic. I would prefer it without it.
"""Interesting story.  I used to have a piano that resembled this very one..."""
I hate that they added music to this. It cheapens the moment, like they have to remind you what to feel.   There was this moment when he started the car that you could see the engine noise rejogged some memories of his youth that flooded back.
You know, its weird. Watched the whole thing, started to get really teary eyed. On the edge of crying. But then heard the music and got pissed. Turned it off. It just somehow took a beautiful moment and turned it into a TLC special. It's basically the same music when say a hoarder figures out they need to change their lives. On those TV shows.  Ruined it for me.
And it’s an automatic so it makes it easier for him
Click click
Was he not wondering why so many pics were taken
Photoguy didnt trust the video guy so he was taking a timelapse just in case.
Yes.   It’s weird to say but I feel somehow better after seeing this.   Simple enduring love. Good job reddit. 
And he turns to his daughter who is now 9 years old.   She looks at him and says, “Punch the gas daddy.”  
He instantly became 30 years younger. 
I hope you can too. I had this same wish to find my dad's dream car for him but cancer beat me to it. 
Who knew about this! - I know, he was so cute when he was kinda angry. 
Sí, Lance.
I know, I'm already blubbering like a fool on the toilet. 
*click click click click click click*
I get what you're saying. I was adopted.  I'll most likely never meet my biological father, but that's okay. I know who my dad is. 
Stepdad here.   Fucking warms my heart to see this sentiment expressed.  Thanks pal. 
> If that's not love, I don't know what is.  Selling it to help support your family.
Maybe it's for the family dude, the moment is touching for us to enjoy but don't forget these are real people who are trying to capture a humbling and personal moment. I don't think they really care about your sentiment, it's really none of your business. 
Walking fast
Yeah it’ll make it a lot more drivable for him, he seems to be a little creaky in his old age, not that he’s in bad shape or anything, but I think a manual might have him driving it less, and at his age he should drive it as much as he can while he can. 
Click click click
I'm guessing it was so loud cause the videographer was taking snapshots as they filmed in which case it would sound louder in the camera mic as the shutter clicks but less audible to others in person. Just a guess though since this is what happens with my camera
My heart can’t take this
But he can't. He has to sell it again to help raise his now 9 year old daughter.
I’m not crying my eyeballs are just sweaty
 **He may have been your father, boy. But he wasn't your daddy.** 
"I never met my biological father.  He died in 2013 and I didn't even find out until 2014 or 2015 when I finally decided I was ready to learn more about him.  My Mom married the man I refer to as Dad when I was 4 and he legally adopted me.  When I told him I found out my biological father had died, he said he was sorry if I felt I had missed out on anything.  Without even thinking I said ""Nah, I have a Dad, he's the one who missed out.""     To me, he's never been my stepdad or adopted dad or anything like that.  He's the one who taught me how to fish, ride a bike, use tools, drive stick, change my own oil, etc.  He gave up on his dream career to bust his butt and take care my mom and I.  We may have butted heads like crazy when I was a teenager, but we both learned from it and we're closer now than ever.  He's my Dad.    "
Faces pass
Especially an older manual, those things took a bit of force to shift, at least compared to modern day manuals which shift pretty easily.

I have pink-eye right now and this is really fucking my shit up. 
That line killed me to wee tiny pieces first time I heard it. I don't know my biological dad, but my step-dad was my daddy. It's been six years since he died and our relationship was best described as a revolving door. There was so much we never got to say or do to make up for the time we didn't have, but he was a good man and I think about him often and how he's influenced my adult life. I miss him dearly. 
And I'm home bound

BANANA BANANA BAAAAA
I love how they were all snuggling on the couch, complete with cute dog, prior to this. 
Honestly the dad snuggling up with his kid is just the best part of this. 
I cannot imagine how liberating this would feel. To receive this gift from your child, someone you raised, js ... Unbelievable. 
If you're curious what was inside the envelope here it is [https://i.imgur.com/a/rJxGUxu.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/a/rJxGUxu.gifv)  and the app he developed is called Videoshop
"Here's a quick translation:  Dad ""no son"" Mom ""I love you, thank you thank you.  So much trouble (or fighting) for three months..to pay...  The last part is hard to tell but it's still very touching."
"And now I'm a mess after the uttering of, ""no, hijo."""
Even the camera person was cryin 
It's my dream to one day do the same for my parents..
I can’t wait to do this for my mother.. She’ll be crying, I’ll be crying, it’ll be great 
I love everything about this video, but especially the dad cuddling his adult son at the beginning. Oh man. I have some major feels right now. 
I love how the sister or girlfriend or friend, whoever was filming was also moved and crying.  So sweet.
We need more of this in 2019
100% This is my dad, and now I'm reminded I need to call him.
Y'alll's this dad looks just like my dad, equipped with that white Hanes shirt he probably got from Walmart. Embrace your papas while you still have them ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
First thing I thought of too:) also loved the way they hugged him after. Like he was still their baby even though he was grown up.   
This is the first thing i would do with a surplus of money. The ability to relieve the financial stress of my parents would make me feel just as liberated and proud.  I bet a lot of other ppl would agree 
that app is so user friendly! Would recommend to download
Is this the dude? https://videoshop.net/features
Wow these comments are sus 
I'm sure even his grandma would consider him a 'Good Mijo.'
Is that what that was?? I thought it was me
My mom doesn’t have any bills. I pay all of them, including mortgage.  She lives pretty light so it is not hard.  It feels pretty good.  But she’s still my mom and is hard on me lol
"He says ""No hijo"" literally ""Son, no..."".  Im Mexican and my parents usually mean to say ""no son, you did not have to"" when they use that tone. I might be putting something in there so the literal translation is ""Son, no...""    "
Please god more of this. Im tired of all the hate we get fed on a constant basis.
"Oh yeah well mine sent me a selfie from a cemetary the other day with no context or caption. And then today a picture of a car wash completely boxed with snow followed by ""yummie"".  I just dont even know how to respond to either of those...honestly.  EDIT: For anyone curious about an example [enjoy](https://imgur.com/sYllzYI.jpg) . It's an inside joke that doesn't really need explaining but the comment afterwards though is just gold."
First law of being a parent:  They’ll always be your baby, even when theyre old enough to have their own
I've been using it for years! I love it so much that I paid for pro. I suddenly feel like I had a little tiny part in this!
For real. 10m+ downloads and 4.7 stars though at least on Google Play... No wonder he was able to pay off the mortgage.
Oh wait is “mijo” just a shortening of “mi hijo”

Help! I'm trapped in xvideos comments and I can't get out
Actually it seems the company is under his name still, and someone is putting out updates frequently and recently.   It’s also a pretty expensive app, with a free version that shows small adds while also being quite useful (I downloaded the completely free version only, not the trial only version of all features) It’s possible in the first few months after launching the app, he sold enough lifetime memberships and made a bunch on the people paying monthly (assuming a monthly plan was an option then. It is now.)
“It’s awesome lookin” love it.
He’s actually crying because he just found out he has three soulless  ginger kids. /S
His son in the red shirt who starts crying with him is what gets me even more emotional
Oh my gosh, crying dads always get me. I love these glasses just because of how happy they make people.
I have literally never seen one enChroma video where the guy doesn't cry.
aww, the sons' reactions are so sweet too!
It's so bright you Ginger fucks, even tho no one will love you,I always will.
I found this video on YouTube. I do not own it.
I started to tear up at the video.  I actually cried reading this comment!  Hilarious.
The way his dad hugs him when he realizes he’s crying - I am just sitting in my car bawling. I lost my dad in April and this sub is killing me lately.
r/happycryingdads is one of my favorites!
">*I'd no idea you were all souless gingers! Mary! You lied! I asked you and you said no they were normal! You liar I'm leaving!""*"
You haven’t lost your dad.  He’s in your heart and memories.  Keep his memory alive and cherish your memories by sharing with family and friends.
I’m really sorry for your loss.
that's where we are
It doesn't help that it was a trend on YouTube for youtubers to buy these and act like they were colorblind for views.
"""But, honey... Have you looked in the mirror?"""
I’m an idiot. That is where we are.
right, someone actually explained that even if it does work yhe color blind person won't notice that much change when they first wear it because they're not used to it so it takes time to actually start to notice the color changes
And he divorced her because she's a ginger lover.
no no it was so wholesome  it happens to the best of us
I tried them out and it was pretty meh at first.  Same reds, just rose tinted.   The later I started noticing thingsm. Cars which I previously would have called black were deep red, single dead oak leaves which now appeared a brilliant red.  I got them in July and this fall has been amazing.  My favorite season is even more favoritey now.  But it's definitely something I need to notice as I've always been able to see reds, just muted
I'm so sorry, this is heart-wrenching news. Thoughts, prayers, and as much as I can spare into the GoFundMe.  My husband was dx'd with stage IV, metastasized to his lymph system and lungs, in the late 80s. He was 25. His local oncologist referred him to MD Anderson and after 13 rounds of chemo and radiation, he achieved remission. I pray you are blessed with the same.
Whatever the outcome, make it a good fight man.  I'll pray for strength for you, and peace for whatever comes next. You made a difference, and I thank you.
I am so sorry to hear this. PLEASE, if you haven’t already - make videos for your little girl. Could be videos of you speaking to her, or videos of you both (playing, singing,  literally ANYTHING). My daughters’ dad died very unexpectedly when they were almost 2 and 3.5.   I have ONE video of him dancing with them and they love watching it. My only wish is that we had more video or sound memories. Pictures are great - but nothing compares to them being able to hear his laugh and voice. Positive thoughts and prayers to you and your family.
Reading your gofundme page, and what you wrote above, you sound as though you're not going anywhere without one hell of a fight. That you are thinking of your family's wellbeing in such an intensely difficult personal time shows what an incredible person you are.   Ps. In the gofundme pictures, your daughter radiates happiness. You and your wife created that for her. I hope this makes you feel proud x
I’m a sad crying dad for you. I’m so sorry, friend.
My Dad had stage 4 throat cancer.  That was over 10 years ago and he's still here.  Kept his voice box too.  Surviving happens.  Good luck and best wishes to you and your family.
If you can bring yourself to do it, write to her while you can. I had a friend who lost her mom to breast cancer and her mom wrote to her in a journal and she really cherished it. Tell her all the stories you can think of, stories of when you were a kid or things you did in college and twenties, the things you want to do with her. I’ll be praying for you to achieve those goals. Thanks for sharing the gofundme.
Lets get on this shit Reddit!
Growing up in Houston I saw MD Anderson work some miracles. He's in the best place in the world to receive treatment, if anyone can heal him it's the amazing doctors of MD Anderson
All of this. Videos videos videos. Does it hurt? Might you cry? That’s okay. Make all the videos you can. I wish I had more videos of my mom.   Cancer sucks, and I hope you find as much peace as you can.
 *instantly drops cigarette*   So sweet, he just melts.
I’m sure there is some backstory to this meeting, maybe they were estranged....because It is pretty clear he was nervous. That moment of meeting his family just made all the crap (of traveling, staying alone) worth it.   I do hope they all had a great time and that they are happy together now. 
Girl in the blue jacket. Face of pure innocence.
This guy is like the king of this subreddit.  It's always great too.   
R.I.P angrygrandpa 
I didn't see him do that when I first watched this and was worried he was going to set his daughter's hair on fire.
Unfortunately, the man here passed away a few months ago. He and his son ran a YouTube channel called AngryGrandpa (him playing the angry grandpa) 
Right? Smiling from ear to ear and doesn't seem to give second thoughts about giving him a hug.
So sad that he’s gone now, he’ll always be in our memory
STOP, You’ve committed crimes against Skyrim and her people.
Oh that is too bad, but, I still hope he and his grandkids had an awesome time! He looks like the kind of man who would play the gruff yet lovable grandparent very well! 
Then pay with your blood!
He did.
I can’t believe I fell for that. Well played, I mean you didn’t have to kill the man, but credit where credit’s due. And I’m happy he may be still around for his family.   I still cannot believe I fell for that.   Edit : u/Xogmaster, not cool man not cool
[But seriously, he’s dead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Grandpa)
Ok, now I’m fucking angry. I don’t know what the truth is anymore. 
This was a rollercoaster of emotions LOL
Roller coaster of emotions and steamroller of feelings. 
Somehow the beer is the cherry on top of this wholesome video...
That's what you get if you are a supportive, kind hearted father.
This shit is making me tear up. He must have been an amazing father
"""Yo no quería nada!!!"" Those are the words of a man who knows he has everything by just being with his loving family!!"
I love him and love this family wow I’m not crying you’re crying
That’s the walk of a dad who has done hard labor most of his life. Good on his family. That’s really sweet.
Lol bro the corona 😂😂😂
Every Mexican dude I know loves his Coronas hahaha
Presumably still is?
"""I didn't want anything!"" for the lazy"
I’ve seen some older Mexican dudes drink all fucking day and look and act completely sober. I don’t see how they do it.
He was only in it for the truck. Now that he has it he's a terrible father.  The long con.

When you get older and the kids are grown and gone then they become your children. Hard to not humanize them. Lost my 10yr old Golden 6 months ago and every Golden I see on here tugs the strings pretty hard.
I had to put my childhood dog Rocky down earlier today at the age of 12. This post made me a complete mess. These past few days have been some of the hardest days of my life
I think it's happy. It's love and loss, it's thankfulness, support and gratitude.

“You haven’t changed a bit except for your hair”  So cute 
At the same time these warriors are tough as nails while truly loving each other.  They understand real loss and the brevity of life. 
When I heard, 'I never thought I'd see you again.' That's when I broke down
I have a best friend, a brother, who I served in war with in Afghanistan. We came close to dying multiple times and saved each other's lives multiple times (army infantry).   We still call and text every day despite being states apart. If you've ever read up on trauma bonding it's very real. I would still give my life for him, no questions asked. I know he feels the same.  We joke around still about all the times we've been blown up (7 times for me, about 10 for him), shot at, called in danger close air and indirect because shit was getting too hot, and the lives of our brothers and civilians we've saved. We talk about rejoining together, doing contracting work together, fighting poachers in Africa, you know normal army bro shit.   If I ever lost him I don't know what I would do. He is truly my last bit of sanity and one of the few reasons I haven't suck started a shotgun yet. I can't imagine thinking I'd never see him again. 
IF GOD PROMISED THERE WOULD NEVER BE A FLOOD AGAIN THEN WHY DOES THIS VIDEO EXIST   GAH DAMN MY EYES
Now I gotta watch Band Of Brothers again (not complaining).
True though, that man looks like he has aged super well. They both have.

I wonder if poachers know how many people want to kill them?
I want you to know that this comment of yours saved my day from being a total shitshow. I'm not one for verbal grandiosity that comes from poets and authors, but simple comments like yours remind me what it is like to be human and to be able to feel emotion. Godspeed
Major Winters will forever be my idea of the perfect man. 
Honestly, even if they don't live far into old age, every elderly war vet you see prior to Vietnam looks like the healthiest person on the planet.
Nah, I doubt it's that. I'm assuming they are Korean war vets(?) so at the time, you were kind of just thrown into a unit with guys from all over the United States. They could have been reassigned during the war or just discharged  without getting each other's address. [It would have been pretty easy to look up if he died in the war.](https://www.accessgenealogy.com/military/korean-war-casualty-list.htm)  Even today, soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan lose touch with each other - although social media makes it a lot easier to keep up.
Short answer: lol yeah
You need to take a stroll through the VA and try that statement again. The healthy aging vets that you're seeing are anomalies. 
Survivors bias.

happy crying dad, happy crying siblings, back slaps, multiple lift hugs...  this might be the best one of these I've ever seen on this sub. wow.
Those back slappies. I feel that in my soul.
There is zero doubt in my mind that is their big brother. Just the pure love and clear respect they have for him.   I’d give anything to have mine back.
Thank god they showed it up to the sister getting a hug! I was so worried it would get cut short before he had a chance to hug everyone at the party.
I think it is so amazing how people can relate to one another overcoming things like language barriers. I'm willing to bet that most people that watch this find themselves getting a little teary-eyed and knowing exactly how that moment would feel if they were that father or son or any member of that family. Even if you don't understand the language that they are speaking you know how they feel.
When sis came in i lost it thats Fam yo
That is really interesting! I love unique words. Thank you for sharing.
So, I studied anthropology at uni, with a particular focus on ethnography. And one of the things I find most interesting and beautiful about the internet’s tiny communities is the way so many of you end up doing reasonably good anthropological/ethnographic work sort of spontaneously. The way your comment breaks this down by codifying and indexing the content with references to a single frame—the world of what causes intense paternal happiness, and the peripheral experiences that come with it, like crying siblings for example—is just super interesting.  And watching how communities like this spontaneously emerge and thrive is a second-order kind of fascinating, too.  And I just wanna to say thanks, I guess!
Yeah absolutely amazing video. Seems like a great family!
Younger brother in the back has strong introvert sibling vibes
As a big brother to a baby sister that part got me.

I felt like he was just intensely focused on containing himself so he didn’t miss the exact millisecond that it finally became his turn.
All those early drives to the rink.   All the money on lessons.   All the hockey gear that’s stunk up the garage.   All the knicks, stitches, and doctor visits.    All wrapped up in that embrace.   God damn. Who is cutting onions in here 
Too much emotion! Better slap him around a little! Too hard. We’ll hug again. 
Now that is proud father right there 
Theres nothing better then Dad or your best friend who hit you with excitement. It doesnt even hurt just pure joy and adrenaline 
/r/hawwkey 
SOMEONE PLEASE STOP CUTTING THE ONIONS WE ARE ALL SUFFERING
Honestly reminded me of my dad when I told him I was wearing his dad's wedding band in my wedding.  He teared up, hugged me, gave me a little push, called me an asshole for making him cry, but then hugged me again. Too many feels
That's a hockey hug. 
Aww i wanna give him a hug!
I love the pride in those tears.
Hey I just wanna say something from the bottom of my heart and from my family to yours. I don’t know you but this picture says so many more amazing things than just your brother being the first to receive a masters. Which by the way” Awesome Job” You have enlightened my day, year etc for showing all of us that if you put your heart into anything you can accomplish your goals! This picture also shows unity and support for him and the most inner upmost Love from your father to his son. That emotion shown is real as real gets and makes me want to go and make my father proud in some way. Strength and a strive for excellence is very plain on your family’s faces which obviously the great role models he has are amazing people. I’m sorry to rant about this but the photo is that of love , happiness, strength and also how great America can be for those of us who really really want to be something better. Be a helping hand in our small part to this world how ever that may be! Thanks for your post Good Day

Dads are so stoic sometimes.  You can tell he's so emotional.  But he just sits and appreciates.  What a great gift!
I love the dog trying to comfort him. Their like idk why you’re crying but I’ll lick you till it’s better.
Amazing gift!!!
Step dad here - this is incredible. I’m not crying.
I love this so much!!! 😭
Dads are like that because they are trying to control their emotions and not show them, if he was talking you could here the crying in his voice, so he sits silently.
If only they knew that showing emotions = strength and confidence
"Can confirm. Am a dad, was taught to be ""strong"" and not to cry. Was taught to be strong like the rock you stand on or to be the calming force in a storm. But to always maintain strength, confidence and stability.   When my son was born, I nearly burst into tears how amazing the experience was but I could not. I reverted back and reeled in all those emotions back to maintain my composure.   After everyone has gone to bed, so no one sees me cry/tear up, I'll sit alone in the dark and some times go through videos and pictures of my son growing up and reaching different milestones. I'll tear up and relive those moments."
I love this. I had a strict no family rule just for this reason. My big, bearded husband needed to bond with his baby without others around. I fell more in love with him when I saw him looking down at his daughter, sobbing with happiness!
Man stuff like this makes me emotional. My kid was born premature and had a few health complications at the very beginning. And I remember getting to hold him for the first time after knowing he was gonna be alright and it was really emotional. Now he’s 9 and a big pain in my side but I wouldn’t trade it
I’m too pregnant for this...
Maybe hard and tough man for the world. But soft and caring for his daughter :)
Oh man, that must have been soooooo scary!  My son made no sound for just 10 seconds after he was born (via C section), though those 10 seconds seemed like an eternity - I can't imagine how scared you guys must have been. I really hope that everything keeps getting better for her - she's beautiful!  I was also a proud beard owner before my son was born. After about an hour of fatherhood, my glorious beard was in a hospital bathroom sink - I hacked it off with scissors I bought at the gift shop because it kept getting in the way while I was holding him.
My ovaries just started rattling like all hell is lose, am too male for this again.
Also for new dads, if you don’t ‘feel it’ for a while, that’s ok too.    It took months before I got there, and was feeling like I wasn’t normal because I didn’t get that overwhelming feeling everyone talks about.     Once he evolved past the “sleep, cry, eat, poop” cycle and actually start communicating was when it ‘clicked’ for me.  Don’t feel bad if you’re not infatuated during this time, it comes when it comes.
I’m expecting my first baby come December. I’m not an emotional guy and my girlfriend has been waiting on me to cry throughout the pregnancy. I’ve wanted nothing more than to become a dad and know I’d sob my eyes off in a moment like this. I’m so excited!
Please be a crying dad. My father is from the generation that walked out of the room when any emotion welled up inside.   It was confusing and such a waste of opportunities to fully connect. He remained emotionally distant throughout his life and I’m still healing.   But he did way better than his own dad so I do love him anyway.
Oh, you poor guy. You’re about the experience all the emotions, at least for the next 20-30 years. When you see that baby pop out, your world will change in an instant. No holding back the tears then for me.
Yup, I wasn’t emotional at all prior to my child, I cried when she was born, cried a little at ever subsequent milestone and one night I flat out wept because I realized there’s come a time where I wouldn’t be there to see her grow and protect her.
That’s just so sweet, and so nice to see the dad isn’t ashamed of showing emotion in front of his boy, let alone in front of the world.
When the guy who beat you is crying... you raised a good egg.
Plot twist the it’s the winners son. That’s why he’s crying as his opponent walks away with his son
It's hard losing in front of your children. The thing about real life heroes is sometimes they take a L.  Edit: Thanks for the silver kind stranger:s My first!
Now I’m crying
We really need these images. I wish every man and boy could feel free to express their emotions this way.
I’d be so pissed. Like...”*hey thanks kid, I really wanted to feel good about my victory but now I feel like shit. God what an ass!*”
I’m at work, so I’m just doing that heavy short breathing thing where your chest hurts in the middle and you try not to let anyone see your eyes
The way she tried to jump on him like she’s still little.
r/happycryingeveryone  That’s awesome. And she jumped into his arms in front of her classmates. Never mind she’s a teenager. She’s daddy’s little girl.
Didn't read the title at first. Thought it was a guy coming to his daughters school in a fursuit
Kudos for walking straight after seeing her.
That dude sat right next to them is in the worst possible seat in that room right now.  Every motherfucker looking in his direction, and he even tries to just get on with his work and pretend everyone isn’t staring right at him
Dad shows up as a fucking furry
There was a YouTube channel filled with servicemen and women surprising their loved ones after coming home from overseas. I can’t quite remember the name of it but I think it was like BobJonson1984 or something  EDIT: the channel is called Military Homecomings. Some real sweet videos on it
Yea, but got a little creeped out seconds before she knew it was him. OMG!. GTF away creepy furry gu... oh wait”.
I won’t see my daughter for 10 days (starting today) and it’s breaking my heart...I’m not deployed, just work shit, and I cannot imagine how much our soldiers push down in order to do their job without distraction.  I am in continued awe of their work ethic and dedication to this country (especially in its current state).  Fucking kudos and love and hugs to all of them, their families left behind as well...to have to be the one who waits is just as hard IMHO.  Moments like this should remind us how insanely wonderful it is to see our loved ones at the end of each workday.
It...is?
Same. I’ve seen it done this same way a few times before and it just never seems like the best way to go... at least these teenagers weren’t making fun of wolfie
imagine having your papa away for a long time and finding out he's became a furry, i'd get creeped out as well
Military wife here. Pregnant and preparing for our first deployment and year apart. Thank you for the recognition. It sucks ass and these videos get me crying every time.
It took far too long for anyone to give that guy a goddamn hug.
This is beautiful and man, what a shock to the brain it must’ve been to experience all of that at once. Is there a version of this video with sound?
Version with sound and no text: https://youtu.be/hqHlIRZnF38  Edit: Source, original (for those CTRL+F'ing)
He reminds me of the dad from cloudy with a chance of meatballs
Literally why I came to the comments haha GIVE THE DAMN GUY A HUG
Yea it did but he was enjoying the colors.   My dad was fully colorblind all of his life as well. He could only see black, white, and gray. I didn't not have a good relationship with my dad AT ALL but I did feel really bad that he couldn't see how truly beautiful things were. He never felt sorry for himself and he definitely didn't want others to feel sorry for him so he never told anyone about it. He passed away a couple of years ago and I really wish that he were still alive so I could get him a pair of these glasses.   All my life I never once heard him saying anything about wanting to see the colors except this one day in fall, the leaves we're starting to change colors and fall off the trees and my kids were saying how pretty it was outside and asking pappy if he thought it was beautiful (they were too young to actually understand what it meant to be colorblind) and he started to tear up a little bit and just said yeah it's very beautiful. He turned to me and said how much that broke his heart because his grandkids wanted his opinion on how beautiful it was and he couldn't even say anything like oh look at all the pretty colors (like the reds, yellows, etc.) on the leaves.
Here: https://www.reddit.com/r/happycryingdads/comments/bejmw1/when_her_dad_sees_colors_for_the_first_time/el6ddf6
Also: COLORBLIND PEOPLE DONT SEE IN BLACK AND WHITE
There are many  videos of colour blind people trying the Enchroma glasses for the first time. Its for red-green colour blind people. It's good to be skeptical, but science can do amazing things, and this is not rocket science. They can do them in a prescription version as well. I had a customer who had a pair, says it was the best gift he ever got.
I love how neither of them can hold in their tears after that hug. So sweet. Huge congratulations to the son on his full ride!
Probably worked hard for that too! Gj man
The walk away with the clapping...he is bursting with pride.
Not to sound racist but seeing black people portrayed this was makes me so happy than how the news portrays black people
Dang that's wholesome.
"The fact that the son couldn't even finish saying ""scholarship"" without choking up really got me. So happy for them!"
Son knew it was coming, couldn't finish the news before they welled up. Good on them for their work and humble spirit.
That was my favorite too! So precious. Also the dog getting in there like, “Wut’s goin on?”
Thank you for recognizing this bro. We're out here trying to make it too ✊🏾
Dude, you sound the opposite of racist tbh.
If someone's belief in God makes them a better person, makes them work harder, train harder, do better in life, why should they be vilified for it?  Faith is an extremely powerful motivator. Don't try to steal that motivation from others just because you want to be an edgelord.
Packers organization got in touch with the son. They’re planning something even more special for them  https://twitter.com/brockdickerson0/status/1193237713270583296?s=21
Such a sweet gesture, but man come on, hug your dad! He was even going in for a hug before breaking down :'(
As a bears fan this still made me happy cry
As a Lions fan all I do is cry :(
$32 hot dog no doubt.
Son: I love you dad  Dad: I'm Ok, I'm Ok.   haahhaahahaha I love it.
It’s so heartwarming to see kids have such close relationships with their step parents. Too many people who take on a parent role treat their step kids like garbage.
Man, I'm big time crying. I would give anything to hear this from my dad.
Oh wow I just burst into tears
Managed to survive till the point he said -  *you're my son*  Jesus, this is the wholesome content I'm subbed for
I love that you can’t tell who is more proud. The dad, for raising an awesome son, or the son, for being able to display his last name on the back of his jersey.
My stepmom was the worst, and still is. So things like this are my favorite.
Take my internet point. Pretend it’s a hug. You’re loved and worthy of it.
"The dad was saying ""thank you, thank you very much"" and in the poster was written ""Pepê I want your shirt"""
That dad is so excited and happy for his son’s joy that it’s putting tears in his eyes. Reddit, life is beautiful.
Dang I love witnessing fatherly love  Just warms ya up
Aww. Neither one of them will ever forget this moment. Pretty sweet it was captured on film.   I don’t get sports and don’t enjoy them much personally but I appreciate kindness and humanity.   This was beautiful to watch.
Bold. I like if.
The Dad is saying “smile at the camera so they don’t think you’re abducted. Smile at the camera”.
Honestly, I say this with 0 sarcasm, I do not care how many times this is posted.  Every time I see this... the reaction is so genuine it brightens my day. *every time*
AWWWWW!!!! I love his reaction!
Oh my heck hes like a puppy I can't handle it
That made feel less shitty, thank you!
Omg, he's going to be the best grandpa! You can see it in his face, he's already in love.
This is my feelings exactly. This is the video that made me love this subreddit, it's the epitome of the sub
He reverts straight back to being 6 years old and its adorable. Just pure happiness
When a man can multi task becoming a father on paper AND pet a cat, you know he is a good person.
That second girl is my kids. “I’m going to do it, I just didn’t have time”
Everybody makes jokes that they aren't crying on this sub, when this sub is specifically to celebrate crying men. Let it out guys, its alright.
Damn summer heat got my eyes all sweaty.
His smile when he looks at the camera near the end says it all.
[This is it](https://i.imgur.com/DyPuEGZ.png). That's the face. Look what they did.
AND he got a big ass bag of raisinets?! Dude is living the life!
I thought the SAME THING!! 😍

Love it, that's what life is, watching the ones you love group up and make something of themselves.
Wow, this is so sweet. I can feel his pride for this grandson through the screen... this actually made me cry 🙂
Grandpa is crying because he's a red wings fan.

That Mjolnir throw/catch was incredibly well done.
That may be the gif I had to watch the most to spot all the details 😮😮😮 awesome gif!
The Iron Man guy gets me everytime.
Hey why is Spider-Man there?
Definitely need to watch the loop many times, just because there is so much awesomeness going on.
I almost didnt see Drax in the background
The hammer toss is pretty impressive to me. It's not easy making a throw not look awkward when played backwards.
Who is the second guy on the right supposed to be?
Respect for the dude who jumped into the pool with a full-body Spider-Man suit over and over again.  Look at how wet the deck is, they did *a lot* of takes.   Wet polyester stuck to your face - like waterboarding yourself.

That and the stormbreaker catch too
Also the guy who catches the hammer must’ve been practicing for ages to get it to look right because it looks amazing
Who?
Very good bot  Edit: this shouldn’t have blown up as much as it did. But thanks anyway Reddit<3
This is as fun to watch as the reversed version
he just threw it behind him, but executing it well backwards was sweet
That ~~Black Widow~~Bucky gun spin is top notch forward and reverse.
You might know him by Night Monkey.
UserSimulator is still the best bot
Yes! It just shows how much effort those kids had to put into it, looks like it probably took pretty long to get it just right!
He sold it by keeping his hand extended after throwing it, making it look like he was reaching up to catch it in the reversed version.
I don’t know this one.  Edit: staaaaahp replying directly to me!!  Edit 2: y’all suck
You see who the real superstars are when you see the motions they actually had to make. The Bucky gunspin is currently the most impressive one in my book.

Watching Federer play is amazing but the fact that he is also just such a great guy makes it even more interesting.
Great guy
Doing the Federer Freeze........say cheese!
That’s Phil Dunphy.
Such a nice and wholesome guy. The $128M he's won hasn't gone to his head.  Say what you want about tennis, but the sport doesn't get as much flopping (soccer) or brain injury (football).   Edit: To clarify, I enjoy tennis because there is no flopping like in soccer, nor serious injuries to my favorite players like what we see in football
Not looking forward to him retiring. Such an amazing character and special talent. So blessed to be able to have lived in the era of watching him play.
My dad met Federer! He's apparently a super nice chill dude, they asked him to shoot a bottle off someone's head using his racket and a tennis ball and he did it lol. (My dad used to be an advertiser thing idk and met Federer as part of an advertisement they were doing in his company, a Swiss telephone company called Sunrise)
Federer is such a fucking cool guy
That’s a very good point, giantbucketofass.
Absolutely the best, maybe the most likable athlete of all time in any sport idk
Yeah, in terms of skill required vs. body injuries sustained, tennis is pretty good in terms of big sports. Only problem with tennis is your knees
he really is, probably one of my favorite athletes ever.  Nadal has always been my guy but I secretly like Federer more.  He's just too awesome
Fun fact! I worked at the ATP finals recently, I’m a manager at the o2 arena, part of my areas was the FAB room (backstage players relaxation room) I looked after the food and beverage and staffing in this area.    Generally when the players were in there, my staff didn’t have accreditation to enter so I would go in myself to check snacks/ coffee machine etc. Federer was the only player to thank me personally, and was honestly so polite. (His managers on the other hand...). I’ve never really cared for tennis, but I gained masses or respect for Federer and how he conducted himself towards the arena staffing. Honestly seemed so genuine.  Edit: I still think he looks like the guy from Lazy town tho.
r/rimjob_steve
Oh hey, it’s Wesley!
When Federer plays it looks effortless; when Djokovic plays it looks intense; when Nadal plays it looks like life or death.
When I play, it looks like someone tased a dead horse.
Read this as 'tasted'.
she has the same reaction as my 3yo daughter.
I hope I'm that cute when I'm her age.
I never thought I’d be able to relate so hard to The Queen
Her initial look was... “ what kind of fucking dog is that ?”....  ....COOWS !!!
I love the way she and her husband beam at each other
OMG, she’s so freaking adorable! Double take and COWS! 😂❤️
"The only thing that would make this better is if she said ""MooCows!"" as god intended."
Seems like she gonna out live us all
The explanation is so stupid it makes it even better.
When we’re in the car with my mother and see a cow, every time, she says to my son, “Look, baby! Cow!” My son is 30 years old.
...and my 34 year old wife lol.
You will be
Oh she loves all animals. Turns into an actual goober for horses.
Not a huge fan of the way he beams at other drivers though
33 year old guy here, will never stop saying cows when i see them on the road lol
Thank you. I needed that today.
And dogs.
If possible, I always try to slow down or stop and tell the cows that they are cows. I feel it's very important.
Any time 🥰
I stumbled upon a working English Cocker Spaniel trial video on Youtube and at the end of the video I'm like [who is this little old lady in the do rag and rainco... WTF?!?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvW9zJTXGn0&feature=youtu.be&t=601)
I always moo, unless they're too far from the road. Then I just wave. It's rude to just yell at cows as you go by, there is etiquette to it.
Woah there, buddy. I think the link got a little lost in translation cause that took me to a completely different subreddit.
Grandma send the lotto numbers please.
So this exact same thing happened to me as a kid. My grandmother said she’d send a butterfly when she died. Just a few days later, a butterfly flew by a friend and I while we were playing outside. I told him what my grandmother said and as if on cue the butterfly flew over and landed on me. It stayed on me for a while and then I introduced it to my friend, it flew over and landed on him then came back to me. I’m generally pretty skeptical of that kind of stuff but seeing another story like that makes me really happy. 
It is believed by some that Cardinals symbolize loved ones that pass. There is a saying ‘when Cardinals appear an Angel is near.’ It is so strangely comforting to believe this.
Everyone who eats shit upvote
TL;DR these sorcerers trapped an old ladys soul in a bird. Then stand around and laugh at the torment. 
I’ve always heard that if a cardinal comes to your yard and stays for a bit that it’s a sign from a loved one who passed away. This bird is not afraid of the women and doesn’t try to bite or keep them from petting it. That’s pretty extraordinary behavior for a wild animal, especially a normally skittish bird. That cardinal definitely dropped in on those ladies for a reason.  What a beautiful moment for that woman, and it’s so awesome that she will have a video of it forever. 
i told you when i left that i would send a sign of love -  the prettiest of birds would pay a visit from above!  a gentle friend of brilliant red would fly down from the sky  to show you that i love you, and my love will never die  so watch for it! but children - in your hearts you must believe  it breaks my heart to think if all you're going to do is grieve....  with heavy hearts and sadness it is harder to respond  look forward to tomorrow, and the love that waits   beyond   
Now that’s what I like to see right when waking up. Thank you

My grandmother passed away a few years ago. She absolutely loved the Toronto Blue Jays, and would go to Florida every winter because it was easier on her arthritis. My mother (her daughter) used part of her inheritance for a family trip to Florida after she passed. The day we were set to go there was a blue jay flying around our house. Never was very spiritual until that moment. Could be a dumb coincidence but I like to think she was wishing a safe trip.
What if it just had the bird equivalent of rabies? 
I don't believe it, but I will be happy if I am wrong.
She's dead, not psychic!

My grandfather just passed away and my father played his birthday in lotto and won 15k. Theres an afterlife and I want to understand how it works.
As an atheist, this type of stuff makes me really happy. Yes it's unexplained and not necessarily reasonable but it's that type of stuff that it really doesn't matter if you believe it for the moment you get to remember loved ones. 
I'm going to send a horde of crazed weasels to the last person/people to see me alive. If they survive, I will bestow on them my spiritual protection for the rest of their lives.
My Grandma always said she would come back with a ladybug to me after she passed, which was two months before my son was born. We needed an emergency C-section and right after he was born, in a sterile operating room, a ladybug came and landed on his head while he was in my arms for the first time. The doctors were extremely agitated and confused that a bug somehow got into their operating room, but I knew it was my Grandma Zazzoo and it was a magical experience.
My grandmother loved butterflies and would always get me sweaters or shirts with butterflies on them. A couple years after she died, I had a dream where I was talking to her about certain things going on in my life and she hugged me. She told me she had to go, then she transformed into a butterfly and left. The next morning on my way to class, I called my dad and told him about my dream. A few minutes into our conversation, a butterfly landed on my shoulder and I started tearing up. I’m also skeptical about things like this, but it made me feel she was still watching over me after all. 
this made me happy
No wonder I never see them        
There is this cardinal that comes back every summer and spends the entire day running into my window over and over and it wont stop. IF WHOEVER THAT IS IS WATCHING, STOP!!!
This is the same thing that happened after my grandfather died. There were very rarely cardinals at my grandmothers house. After my grandfather passed, one cardinal would always sit outside of her kitchen windows. Coincidence or not, it was still a great comfort for her to think that the cardinal was indeed her husband making sure she was ok.
Seems like that's what they believe. The description on the Facebook post:   > This is amazing- so as many know my husband’s grandmother Dorthy passed into glory two weeks ago.. (she was 97)   > For the past few years my mother-in-law Debbie and her sister Jeanne have talked to Grandma and on several occasions asked her (when it was her time to leave this world) send them a sign once she was in heaven, and they specifically asked that a cardinal would be involved. Aunt Jeanne also prayed that the Lord would do it in such a way that they would never have thought of. Well, God answered that prayer yesterday, (the day after grandmas memorial service, and hours after they had been talking about that very prayer) while they were playing grandmas favorite card game, “Canasta”!!!  > They heard something at the kitchen window and my father-in-law Brian went out to check. A cardinal was there and he was able to bring it inside. For 10 min they held and pet it, then they decided to go outside to release it. Following is a short video clip of this amazing experience and what happens next! (The bird flew away 10 min later) You must watch!! 😭❤️  Can’t link to the post as per the sub’s rules though and reddit's anti doxx policies.  ----  Shout out to u/vibrex for showing me this video earlier! 
"I know some of y'all are probably joking, but I don't think that's what they're implying. ""Sending a sign"" doesn't generally mean the dead person's spirit possesses a random animal or object, it's that they're using the animal or object as a messenger. The bird is not supposed to be grandma."
“AoOOoo the old git is afraid to fly! Stupid granny!”

I have a bunch of Cardinals in my back yard, but I always assumed it was because I have a bird feeder back there.

My grandpa put on a pig nose and pretended to be a pig in his final hours. We ate bacon the next morning.
"Same here.  I'm a devout atheist (is that a thing?), but soon after my dog died, I had a lucid dream where I was with my dog and my wife.  I looked around and told her, ""this is a dream,"" and she said to me, ""well, you should pet him.""  I did."
It's perfectly fine to be an atheist and still be open to the idea that there are strange, wonderful, and terrifying phenomena in the universe that are as yet unexplained.        It's really only a problem when you look at unexplained events, assign specific meaning to them without any evidence, and start making decisions based on that.     
My mom was a big ladybug fan. She passed when I was 11. This past December as I was setting up for my wedding. My soon to be wife calls out and says, “Adam, look - it’s a ladybug!!”  I came over to take a look and said “That’s an Asian beetle, and they actually have decimated the ladybug population in the region.” It was the least romantic thing I could have ever said.

Gender doesn't mean much when you're ripping through the void trying to find a vessel to send a message to your family with. You know how many crows she had to possess and kill until she lucked into this cardinal?

I told my friend the other day that VR gaming is going to cause some folks to die. Like, you'll find me laying on the living room floor with a pair of VR goggles and a broken neck.
There should be a subreddit about people forgetting they are in VR..
It's almost cartoonish the way he falls, like he hangs in the air for a half-second longer than should be possible.  I'm assuming it happened because he was trying to prop himself up against the fence post with his left hand, only there is no fence post so he just fell
As much as I laugh at this...we have all leaned on that fabled invisible fence haha
VR or not it's always a good idea to test the stability of something before putting your entire body weight into it.  In this case it wasn't strong enough.
"To anyone who has never done VR, the tendency to ""forget"" where you are is real. You think ""I will never be that dumb"" and then you try leaning up against a virtual wall."

This obsession with designing VR with the intent of having games with 1:1 VR to real world freedom of movement is so dumb. You don't need to design new games around it. You just sell people VR headsets instead of flat-screen TVs. No more roommates fighting over sharing the TV. No more finding space for it in your room. No more *having to sit up in bed at all.* Just private viewing of media that takes up your whole FOV.  Edit: Lol who knew so many would get upset over the idea of using VR as a 2D viewing device instead of 3D immersion.

He doesn’t sugarcoat, but he doesn’t excuse either. He says things are absolutely terrible when they are and he gives actual ideas and concrete methods he wants to do to fix them. And best of all, he cuts through the bullshit.
"One of the stupidest things I've heard so far from any of these debates was right after thing moment I think, when Klobuchar dropped what I can only assume she thought was a fucking *bomb*, and goes ""Well Bernie, you might've wrote the bill, but I *read it*"" and she got this little grin on her face. I just remember hearing someone behind me giggling and yelling out ""WHAT?"""
Why isn’t this man already President. I love him.... from the U.K. and I’ll be honest I don’t fully understand your voting system

Not my joke but someone said something like “Tim Ryan isn’t running for President. He’s auditioning to be a distraught cuckold husband in a porno.”

How marijuana ruined my life plans:  I got caught with it.  My roomates called the police because I had weed in my room, they came found it while I wasn't there. Arrest warrant went out, I got arrested, and then I had a record.  My plans were to work in a job that requires security clearance for military engineering jobs (mechanical engineer).    Couldn't get that clearance with a record, even after I got it sealed (gov can still see those, not private companies).  Really sucked that weed wasn't decriminalized in the state I went to school in like it was back in my home state.
For the record, legalization and decriminalization are not synonyms. In theory, both could be in favor of decriminalization but not legalization.

70% of Americans favor public healthcare. It's one of the least controversial issues amount voters.  It's our politicians that won't permit it because their campaigns are paid for by the HC industry.  Even a make-believe leftist like Warren backed off of something 70% of Americans support, offering a transition plan--I guess for those 30% of Americans? It's a clear sign of where loyalties lie.

At first I thought the title referred to the groom, who's obviously wearing his dress suspenders.
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain.
Now hive seen everything.
They have all probably been there for a while waiting for the actually ceremony to begin.
Now I imagine every wedding in the US has everyone with their hands on their chests while the national anthem plays in full
“You have your mother’s eyes”
This one's gonna sting for years
Plus the ceremonial bee guy.
there is a person wearing a bee costume.
Definitely generates a lot of buzz
The bee didn't wear white which was nice of him.
Honey, comb down.
Now your just making everything sticky
Oh bee-have!
Buzz off!
It's cool they laughed at it.
I would have found this hysterical back when I was a waitress. Far better than people shouting across the restaurant to get your attention.
That couldn't have gone any better.

"I used to do this with the computers in high school. The teacher would monitor the screens to make sure we arent just playing games and I would open word and type in big letters ""I NEED HELP"".

That could have gone bad...
Did you expect the Chris Farley Coffee Switch reaction?  edit: [Video](https://dula.tv/videos/chris-farley-coffee-switch/)
Then she showed all her coworkers and then everyone had a laugh and they forgot to actually send up some chili sauce.
This moment is 11/10 working in a restaurant, I feel this so much!
I wish restaurants had a “hey I need help, no rush but I also want you here sooner than in 15 minutes when you’re next likely to check up on us” button
But it could of gone a lot worse
Can this mod regulation end please. So cringey
Why do we need to see OPs explanation on every post? It's always so awkward and unnecessary.
Why... you son of a BITCH!
Man.  That shit woke me up at night in my server years.  4 am eyes wide.  “I forgot that fucking lady’s BBQ sauce.  Fuck.”
"I'm a server and I would love if tables had a little ""I need help"" flag they could just flip up, like a mailbox flag. If I just had one consistent thing to look for if they need something, and they had a for sure way of getting my attention, I think our entire experience overall would be more enjoyable.  It would have to save me the trouble of having to do unnecessary ""are Y'all doing good, do we need anything?"" passes by the table, that's for sure."
I was thinking it was going to fall into the food they were making
It could have fallen into the chili sauce.

Any of my Cats would promptly murder me if I attempt to even put them in that enclosure let alone turn it on, it would be a BAD day for everyone in the vicinity of the dryer.
That's a cat generator
I say it every time I see this gif - the cat is very cute and looks very happy... BUT FLAT FACED BREEDS OF DOGS AND CATS SHOULD NEVER BE PUT IN THIS TYPE OF KENNEL FOR DRYING.   I hate to be that person but as a former groomer this gives me soooo much anxiety. Animals with brachycephalic skulls have extra requirements in order to remain healthy, it is very difficult for them to cool themselves down naturally and being trapped in a hot box where they can’t escape once they’ve had their quota of warmth. They can quickly succumb to overheating and die.

Went to a theatre to watch a play with our theatre director. She's a mom of 4 and was exhausted from wrangling her kids all day. She fell asleep. Partway through the show, there was a scene where the cast started clapping at something and she woke up like in the gif clapping away, joining in. She was so embarrassed.
I love how she just joins in
Looks like TMZ
Unfortunately “collaborative workspaces” are popular now. It’s getting harder and harder to find a workplace with the privacy of cubicles.

Or any tech building constructed in the last 5 years.
I really don’t understand it either because companies claim that the research shows that people like these “collaborative workspaces”, but I kid you not, literally everyone that I have ever asked about them either hate them or were indifferent. Not even one person that I’ve ever asked said that they actually prefer them, and I’ve asked a lot of people. I get that it’s anecdotal but I would expect at least a few to say they liked it. I think some research showed that it actually made people less social/ put in their earphone more often as well.
This is so funny, exhausting apllause.
Good bot
“Open office encourages sharing and forming bonds!!” I miss cubicles
Or a classroom.
That study they all quote is from the 80s. They did another one recently and found people actually get less work done and feel more frustrated in coop work spaces because of the lack of privacy
When they put in “collaborative workspaces” at my office I applied for approval to work 100% from home. That’s how annoying it was to work in them.
where do his wigs go?
Well, that was fabulous.
I think this is the definition of super gay.  EDIT: More a reference to gay superpowers and not degrees of gayness.
Roxxy Andrews? Shook.   Sasha Velour? Brain death.   Phi Phi O'Hara? HILA MONSTER.
This might be the gayest thing I've ever seen.
Oh my god I wish there was audio to this
This man is clearly living his best life.
That was a lot more than I expected and I’m not upset about it. Happy pride month, folks. ‘If it harm none, do as you please’. Strut that shit, bruv!!
What goes up must come dow... where are the wigs?
That's why his hair's so big, it's full of secrets... secret wigs and glitter...
to the shadow realm
Apparently he said Plastique Tiara could have them since they're best friends
I love how this gif kept on getting gayer and gayer with each move.
*big gay
Thought exactly of Sasha Velour when confetti fell off his wig!
Me too, and I've seen gay porn.

I would think so since he also danced for Gaga. You can see him in Telephone, Alejandro, Born this Way, Judas etc. and he’s also in one of Santa Carly Rae Jepsens videos.

It's clearly fake because a real cat wouldn't brake.
Definitely fake. Obviously,  there are two cats. The one you see is steering and calling down to the other cat and telling it which pedal to push.
That skit is over 30 years old now!  r/FuckImOld

"""Hey so, you wanna freind in you?"""
Tom Hanks is such a cool guy
"You gotta love how the groom runs around like ""Mr. Hanks, you ain't gonna steal my girl!"""
I saw an interview one time where Tom Hanks said that he says the same thing to every couple.   To the groom: “Congratulations, you have done really well for yourself”  To the bride: “You could have done better”  Dad phrases at their finest :)
Yesss and Hugh Jackman too!
Oh God do you even realize what you've done?
"""Ryan? James Francis Ryan?"""
"My take was ""wife you're not stealing my photo next to Tom Hanks!"""
She shook his hand twice
Did you know the first private Ryan found which was the wrong Ryan is played by Nathan Fillion?
My thoughts as well!   No way in hell my wife is getting a picture with Tom Hanks but I’m not!
That was really satisfying god damn
Dudes a straight G.
Look at that car past the white line, I’m suprised the truck made the turn   Psa: that’s what the white lines are for, ever see a while line that doesn’t make sense? That’s because they need to make it so a truck driver can make a turn there
I don't want to brag but I've done this in Euro Truck Simulator 2.
Especially impressive since he didn't have the clearance he should have with that guy in the crosswalk!
This must be Boston...
Hell yeah it was.   That dude has got confidence. And rightfully so.
F you bot......  Following in op’s footsteps here
This bot makes me wanna unsub
He just did a G turn
I've had cars pull back, while driving a truck. Always nice, always thoughtful and helpful. Mostly happens in industrial towns where the average person knows the score, but we'd have a lot more courtesy on the road if everyone were so nice.
Because very few trucks are set up this way. His trailer axles are slid all the way up, effectively making it a shorter vehicle. The truck itself is shorter than an over the road truck. Finally, there is only one drive axle.  The truck I drive could not physically take the turn like this one did.  Edit: it's also has no sleeper which also drastically reduces the length of the cab.
It's nice to see a trucker who actually knows how to drive his rig.
I grew up in a heavy Ag town and had a buddy who made it a game to stop past the lines. There are only like 5 lights in the whole town. The one out by the Co-op (grain elevators) had a tight intersection as is since it was an afterthought. Our senior year my friend was at that light in the intersection, most likely bragging about it like he always did (“oh no one is gonna hit me they’ll be at fault”), a full-load semi wasn’t having his shit and took off the entire front end of his Camry. It was a miracle he wasn’t hurt but I literally said to him “now you know the score.” Insurance denied his claim because his agent was at the Co-op when it happened and saw the whole thing. Small towns are funny that way.
"At one of my earlier jobs we needed to ship a piece of an airplane and the only way to do it was with a big rig.  We were on a pretty small GA airport that wasn't really equipped to get this giant trailer to our hangar, but there was a way.  I asked the truck driver if he could back up the trailer through a perilous course of chain link fence and gravel and I'll never forget his response.  He said, ""I can do magical things with this bad boy"", and then he proceeded to back that trailer right up to our hangar no problem.  Fucking balls on that guy"
I want to see a version of Baby Driver with this guy and his truck instead.
This kid looks like a 65yo man who remains unbothered by the ups and downs of life

Yeah I didn’t either lol, I’m almost 32 and this damn kid is already funnier than I am  Edit: a few users have mentioned things about this guy being rly funny (a little older now)and other things about the younger generation and it reminded me of a old video I felt never got enough credit and it comes to mind because it was the first time I ever thought (23 at the time) “wow this kid is like 12 and he’s funnier then I’ll ever be” I believe the original aired on a Tosh but it was only like a 5 second clip iirc, enjoy https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NgCM46CSwd8

I just want to say that every subreddit should have something like this so that the users can say if something fits in the sub. A lot of subs get ruined by people on /r/all upvoting without looking.
I like the redesign. The human teeth make sense now.
I know exactly what you’re saying.  I used to enjoy watching American Ninja Warrior, but then they started doing all the background stories s on the contestants and so many of them had some kind of sob story about how rough their life has been or a tragedy that they’re doing it honor of.  OMG spare us the drama!!!
From what I remember from seeing years ago, they have no advanced access to the course. Some of them build their own training courses though, I'm guessing that's what happened here. Either that or this dude is a freak and there should probably be some scientists looking at him
which is sad, because it's so impressive at regular speed
Redesign is good but where the fuck are the rings?
"American tv will make drama of everything.  *Guy drops hot dog* - 56 shots of the hot dog falling that cuts right before it hits the ground with a overly dramatic music and mixed with another 43 shots of the guy giving an interview of how he felt as the hot dog was falling, 3 comercial intervals later, big reveal 20 seconds before the shows end turns out the guy just dropped 2 inches in a plate. ""OMG I thought it was the end of it, turns out my plate was right below it"" *cue happy music*."

We can already see the effects of restricted content on academia through the paywalled publishing practices of most journals. The high cost of institutional licenses or large-scale purchasing of individual articles can be an overwhelming expense for new companies or smaller universities. Science relies upon the free flow of information and knowledge between persons and institutions around the world. Ending net neutrality puts that at risk.

I tried calling but his mailbox was full. I'm extremely proud of you reddit,I cant believe this many people are telling the FCC Chairman this.
Not sure if this is the right place to ask but here goes.  I'm not American, but how would this impact an internet user of another country?  I know there are localized version of some of the major websites (Google, Amazon, etc), but if there isn't really one for smaller ones, would they be impacted but reversing net neutrality if browsing from outside of the USA?  More generically, how would someone outside the USA be impacted if net neutrality gets killed?  EDIT: [TL;DR Answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7etmk7/help_us_fight_for_net_neutrality/dq7lbky/)
*Hijacking top comment, don't mind me.*  These are the emails of the 5 people on the FCC roster.  **These are the five people deciding the future of the internet.**  The two women have come out as *No* votes.  We need only to convince **ONE** of the other members to flip to a *No* vote to save Net Neutrality.  Blow up their inboxes!  * Ajit Pai - Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov * Mignon Clyburn - Mignon.Clyburn@fcc.gov * Michael O'Reilly - Mike.OReilly@fcc.gov * Brendan Carr - Brendan.Carr@fcc.gov * Jessica Rosenworcel - Jessica.Rosenworcel@fcc.gov  Spread this comment around!  We need to go straight to the source.  Be **civil**, be **concise**, and make sure they understand that what they're about to do is UNAMERICAN.  Godspeed!  Thanks for the gold
"The FCC Chairman probably won't listen to you but your representative might. The trick is to call your representatives **and ask to speak to the person who would deal with Net Neutrality issues in that office.**   You'll be immediately pushed aside, ignored, or sent a form response if you try to go directly to the person in charge (just as you would in any other issue in life). However, if you ask for the person who is actually on the ground doing work on the issue, you'll be speaking directly to the person who has your representative's ear.  **Note:** Do NOT let them brush you off by saying that this is an ""FCC issue."" Ask them if they could call the FCC on your behalf. After all, a call from a congressional representative who is afraid they'll be held accountable goes a lot further than a cold call from a ""concerned citizen"" "
The issue is that the vast majority of places only have a single (or at most two) broadband providers.
How did we as a society allow the internet's fate to be decided by 5 people
In addition, here is a White House petition to [save Net Neutrality.](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality) 
Hijacking for visibility:  **For anyone who is unsure why Title II classification is important and wants some extra firepower when submitting your feedback to the FCC/your senators & representatives/various petitions, please see below.**  From the Communications Act of 1934, Title II:  > **SEC. 202. [47 U.S.C. 202] DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCES.**  >(a) It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.  Link [here](http://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf), page 36  The whole Communications Act is rather long and there may be other pertinent sections, but this is the one that struck me as most relevant when reading through it back when Oliver released his video.  If you know of other relevant/useful information from the Title II classification, please comment below and I'll try to add them to this comment for visibility.  I'll be spamming this comment around, but feel free to copy it into other threads if you don't see it.  Keep calling. Keep fighting.
Anytime someone it is suggested that people leave comments on the FCC site, they generally forget to point out one *HUGE* factor.  **Always leave a UNIQUE comment.**  Do **not** copy and paste a generic statement someone else gave you.    Submitted comments that have the exact same message get lumped together and can often even be ignored entirely, on the justification that they are low-effort, canned and shilled responses.  It extremely easy to dismiss 10,000 comments that are identical as not genuine.  Write your own message with how it will affect you.  A few sentences, maybe.  Not too long, not too short, but **always unique**.    One more time, just to be sure: **Always leave a UNIQUE comment.**
We didn't because the FCC doesn't get the final say. If they approve it it ends up going to congress sometime In December and then they. Vote on it to make it a law.  Really it ends up being decided by how many people comcast Verizon and at&t decided to pay off in congress. 
Do you know if a foreign citizen can sign this? The US is a world leader, and if they kill net neutrality, other countries may look to do the same. So this seems to be a global issue.
This is wrong. The FCC has a final vote in December on whether to repeal the rules or not. However, Congress could choose at any time to put net neutrality rules into law via regular legislation. Many people see congressional action as the ultimate and most likely endgame for this issue. That would be a good thing, though who knows if there will ever get around to doing it given everything else on Capitol Hill.
"So I'm Canadian and feel very strongly about Net Neutrality, however I worry that if we start signing it from outside the country, it would be easy to use our signatures as a way to de-legitimize the petition.  They could always say ""Yes but look at these foreign signatures - they clearly are just fake or meddling in American affairs.""  I want to help in any way I can though, so if there's anyone with ideas please post them."
He reached a status where you'd think he would never die
Do we know what helped Hawking survive the disease for so long? As far as I know, he was given no more than 2-3 years to live when he was first diagnosed.  Is there anything we have learned from his case that could eventually lead to a cure?  &nbsp;  (Rest in peace. A Brief History of Time was the book that first sparked my interest in astronomy and physics.)
As someone without much knowledge in physics, how does Hawking stack up against some of the great famous physicists of all time?  
What one thing should we remember him for in your opinion?
He just left for a party back in 2009 he will be back later.... 
Born on the anniversary of Galileo's death. Died on the anniversary of Einstein's birth.  There's something poetic about that. 
What are some of Hawkins lesser known accomplishments in the science field.
 I read a comment saying that the world is a darker place for losing Hawking today.   I say the world is a brighter place for Hawking choosing to be a part of it.   He could have checked-out long ago. Instead he fought his disease as best as he could, and probably lived a good thirty years longer than anyone might have guessed he would.  So mourn his passing if you must. But if he meant something to you, become a beacon in the darkness---just as he was to so many who might have looked up at the night sky and wondered.  The world can be made better by ordinary deeds by ordinary people. This, I'm sure, is something Hawking would have agreed with.  
Are there an good documentaries out about Hawking's work? In the last decade was he still performing research or was he serving physics in a more ambassadorial role?
Did Hawking have any major unfinished works at the time of his death, or had he already published most of the works relating to his primary fields of research?
Would anyone care to give a brief run down of the significance of Hawking’s major contributions to physics and cosmology? What do we know now about the nature of the universe that was directly demonstrated by his work?  
On behalf of the human race, thank you Mr. Stephen Hawking
How active was Hawking in recent months (or years)? What was he most excited about or interested in these days?
  -  Stephen Hawking’s 3 favorite songs.   “[Symphony Of Psalms](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DqWZGUO_eoc) was in fact the first piece of music Professor Hawking ever purchased. “I first became aware of classical music when I was 15,” he said. “LPs had recently appeared in Britain. I ripped out the mechanism of our old wind-up gramophone and put in a turntable and a three-valve amplifier. I made a speaker cabinet from an old book case, with a sheet of chip-board on the front. The whole system looked pretty crude, but it didn’t sound too bad. At the time LPs were very expensive so I couldn’t afford any of them on a schoolboy budget. But I bought Stravinsky’s Symphony Of Psalms because it was on sale as a 10” LP, which were being phased out. The record was rather scratched, but I fell in love with the third movement, which makes up more than half the symphony.”   [Wieniawski’s Violin Concerto No. 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aNOdaBJbT8A)Professor Hawking was actually inspired to buy a collection of Wieniawski’s music after hearing his second concerto on Radio 3 in the 1990s, but prefers the first in particular for its “haunting phrase in the first movement”.   [Francis Poulenc’s Gloria](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ReqsEqKtyyA) is the final piece in Professor Hawking’s musical trilogy. Part of the work caused a “scandal” – in the French composer’s own words – when it was first performed in 1959 because of its unusual mixture of light-heartedness and spirituality. Poulenc later explained that he had been thinking of frescoes in which angels stick out their tongues and “serious Benedictines whom I saw playing soccer one day” when he wrote it. Professor Hawking first heard the Poulenc Gloria in Aspen, Colorado, during the resort’s 1995 music festival. “You can sit in your office in the physics centre there and hear the music without ever buying a ticket,” he said. “But on this occasion I was actually in the tent to hear the Gloria. It is one of a small number of works I consider great music.” 
"I read ""A Brief History of Time"", and 90% of it was stratospherically over my head...  But the 10% that took was hugely enlightening. An icon and visionary has merged with the infinite, and I'm grateful for my brief contact with him, no matter how removed. "
Michael Crichton, Stephen Hawking, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates are some of my heroes. It is not often that you think deeply about people as heroes, but for me they are. Sadly for me, two of them now are dead.
I like to think that people like him never die. They're just no longer with us. His words and advancements will live on forever as part of humanity's greatness.  He's alive as long as we remember him.
Honestly though, it wasn't all to surprising to hear in hindsight.  At 76 alongside his form of motor neurone disease living past the few years he was expected after being diagnosed?  Little surprising that he lived until his 70's.   I'd be more surprised if he passed in his 80's, given what he had to live through.
I genuinely have never thought of him dying. It was like he transcended into a god level. Im really upset now, Ive never been upset over a famous death before
From what I've read, his condition was a rare type that actually progressed much more slowly than originally predicted. 
I read that doctors actually thought he didn't actually have ALS but a rare, related condition 
He's actually not the only one living for so long with ALS. Jason Becker who used to be an amazing guitarist is close to hitting 50 years and still making music through eye movement. He got diagnosed with ALS around his 20s too.
"If someone more qualified than me comes along, PLEASE correct me. To my understanding, Hawking proposed a lot of theories (both accepted and refuted) that have opened a lot of questions with cosmology and quantum mechanics. He did a lot of 'probing' per say, which inspired a lot of research and further investigation. Additionally (and more famously), he was a HUGE figure in black hole theory, and is comparable to the Issac Newton or James Clerk Maxwell of black holes.  Overall Hawking has been a gift to this world and we should be eternally grateful for his contributions. I don't like to jus go out and say ""X was the best/most influential physicist"" because the quantity and complexity of questions answered fluctuates wildly across the greats, but I would consider Hawking to within the top 50 or 40 physicists in all of history. A more accurate and better description is: he is one of the most, if not the most influential physicist following the modern era. For sure, though, he is a titan in the field of astrophysics and cosmology."
Hawking was an excellent scientist, and just about anyone working in physics today would be happy to have his record of accomplishments. His primary contributions were in the area of black hole mechanics, including the singularity theorems and Hawking radiation. He also did a great deal of interesting  theoretical work in cosmology, but we don't currently have any way of telling whether the models he proposed are correct.  With that said, I don't think we can call Stephen Hawking one of the all-time greats like Einstein, Newton, or Maxwell, who revolutionized multiple unrelated fields of physics. His work was significantly more localized in subject matter and theoretical, and most of it has not been empirically confirmed (although his black hole research is almost certain to be correct).  Of course, his contributions as an explainer of science to the public and as an ambassador for scientists as a group should not be neglected. But they do give some people the impression that he was even greater than he actually was as a physicist.
I'll start with some of his accomplishments: He was one of the first people to propose primordial black holes along with Carr, Zel'dovich and Novikov, which if observed could give us a window into the early universe, and may even be dark matter. Perhaps his most well-known work is the proposition that black holes radiate as black bodies (ie Hawking radiation), generalizing the work of Unruh. This has led to the creation of the lively subfield of black hole thermodynamics and information theory. He is also one of the founders of quantum cosmology (the idea that you can have a wave function representation of expanding spacetime) along with Hartle, Wheeler and DeWitt.  As for how he compares against the greats... this is not to belittle his accomplishments in any way, of which there were obviously many, but none of his predictions have ever been experimentally verified. A lot of people here are comparing Hawking to the likes of Einstein, but honestly, from a working physicist who is familiar with his work, he doesn't even come close. Einstein's ideas represented a fundamental shift in our understanding of the universe, and have been verified over and over again. There are many others who have fundamentally altered our view of the universe (and have been vindicated by experiment) that many laymen have probably never heard of before (Maxwell, Dirac, de Broglie, Bohr, Heisenberg, Friedman/Robertson/Walker, Weinberg/Salam, Yang/Mills, Noether, Gell-Mann, and these are just some prominent theorists of the last century, there are many more great minds behind every groundbreaking experiment, like Wu, Hubble, Ruben, Weiss, Rutherford, Thompson, etc). Until his ideas are verified, they're just untested hypotheses (though nobody in the field seriously doubts Hawking radiation isn't real). Hawking's contributions, while very interesting in their own right, are not the ground-breaking game-changers that revolutionized physics.  That said, I'd say he's probably one of the most influential scientists of the century, not only because of his interesting work, but also because the man is an example of perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds. Not only did he manage to survive, but he pushed the boundaries of human knowledge. That's something we can all aspire to.
Physicist: This man wrote the book on black holes.  Human: This man showed everyone that nothing can stop you from being who you want to be.  EDIT: Thank you for the gold kind stranger!
Putting extremely complex ideas and theories into simple terms for the average person to understand in his books, such as universe in a nutshell.  You will be missed, you were such an inspiration to many minds, young and old.
"one thing he wanted everyone to understand was the concept of imaginary time. i tried to learn it but it made no sense to me.  ""One might think this means that imaginary numbers are just a mathematical game having nothing to do with the real world. From the viewpoint of positivist philosophy, however, one cannot determine what is real. All one can do is find which mathematical models describe the universe we live in. It turns out that a mathematical model involving imaginary time predicts not only effects we have already observed but also effects we have not been able to measure yet nevertheless believe in for other reasons. So what is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds?"" - Hawking   yeah still makes no sense to me, i get that we see only a fraction of the spectrum of light, but i got nothing tangible out of the wiki page."
This brought more of a tear to my eyes than anything else in this thread
Oh wow, really?? I was happy enough that it was on pi day 3/14. That was poetic enough for me, but wow, the stars truly aligned.
"Didn't he also posit the time travel restrictions? ... found it:  it is Chronology protection conjecture,  "" In a 1992 paper, Hawking uses the metaphorical device of a ""Chronology Protection Agency"" as a personification of the aspects of physics that make time travel impossible at macroscopic scales, thus apparently preventing time paradoxes. He says:  It seems that there is a Chronology Protection Agency which prevents the appearance of closed timelike curves and so makes the universe safe for historians"""
I recommend A Brief History of Time (there is a documentary as well as the book). It goes over alot of what his book by the same title covers. Although I'm not certain of his work in his later life, as far as I'm concerned he still spent time research at Cambridge up until recently. However I don't know that for certain.
[Here are the most recent papers he contributed to](https://arxiv.org/find/hep-th/1/au:+Hawking_S/0/1/0/all/0/1)
Brief run down is a bit much. For one, a very important thing he showed us that we know now is hawking radiation. Essentially, black holes don’t exist forever, but they do last for a very very long time.
A couple of months ago Hawking and Kip Thorne completed their work as technical consultants for an upcoming Hollywood movie, expected to be released in 2020-21. Source: Heard from Kip Thorne
"""I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road."""
"This one has become my mantra:   ""One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember is it rare and don't throw it away."""
Crichton went waaaaay before his time to. Such a shame.  People don't realize how influential he was. In 1993 he had the #1 book (the lost world) the #1 movie (Jurassic Park) AND the #1 TV series. (ER).  I don't think that will ever happen again.
He’ll be remembered along the likes of Einstein as one of the great geniuses of our time, without a doubt.   The question now is who is going to take up the mantle of the smartest motherfucker on the planet. I can’t think of anyone else on his level.
I think at this point we all just assumed he was immortal and would live forever. Like Stan Lee, or Betty White.
It was both early onset and slow progressing. Atypical of ALS in many ways.
There isn't really consensus on such, but it is considered plausible by many.
You can't image and autopsy a mind, though. You can get rather crude information about general brain structure from an autopsy (such as gross abnormalities), but it won't get at anything specific about the mind. 
More than likely the most influential since Einstein. Between his work in physics, the success of his book, and his battle with his disease his stardom in physics is something we will likely not see for some time.  Not to mention his public persona, his many appearances in pop-culture and the recent feature length film on his life which helped define him as a cultural icon.  Edit: I was referring to his ability to inspire the general public, not necessarily his work in physics alone. Which is why I included other aspects of his life. The success of his book alone has inspired a generation, and he was likely the most prominent public figure in Physics at the time of his death.
He had a wicked sense of humour for someone with such a debilitating disease
Didnt he also throw a party for time travellers just for giggles? No one showed up since he announced the party after it was done.
Stephen's last academic publication was in June of last year to my knowledge.
"> they do last for a very very long time  Well, how long they last depends very much on their size.  But generally, you are right, even a black hole with ""only"" the mass of the Earth would take > 10^(50) years to evaporate via Hawking radiation."
I remember hearing that a while back he had the option to upgrade his computer's voice to one that's more human sounding.  He refused because by then he considered the iconic robotic voice to be his voice.  He identified too strongly with it to change. 
I didn't know he did ER or was an MD.  I really need to read his novels. More to add to the list.
Maybe Tim Allen?  [In November 1994, he simultaneously starred in the highest-grossing film (Disney's The Santa Clause), topped the New York Times best-seller list with his book Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man, and appeared in the top rated television series (Home Improvement) within the span of one week.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Allen#Career)
Edward Witten is a special mind as well.  I would be cautious about characterizing people as transcendent geniuses, however, without also observing that there are so many people out there with tremendous mental capabilities who don’t have the ability to exercise it due to poverty and lack of educational opportunities.
Science has reached the point where it is too complex for there to be an individual carrying out exciting discoveries. It'll be teams of minds working together around the world (along with computers) that make the next significant advances.
I'm a bit stumped that he made it through when science and medicine wasn't as capable as today yet apparently nothing of the 2010s was enough to help him more. Alas, he probably made 200% of his existence.
With all due respect to Hawking, there have definitely been more influential physicists since Einstein. If you are talking about the quality of physics, he isn't really on par with the likes of Dirac, Feynman, or even Oppenheimer. If we are talking about public influence, then you are speaking with an insane amount of recent bias I am guessing, and not fully familiar with what Feynman and Sagan were doing before years ago. 
 > More than likely the most influential since Einstein  Personally I would say this would be Feynman, but Hawking was certainly up there. I would say most of Hawking's works were not very progressive or influential in the field of physics -- rather interesting or thought-provoking.  Mostly he was lauded for his tenacious dedication to his work despite his disability.  
Does he fall in with Niels Bohr and Paul Dirac, or was he more or less influential than them?
I loved his humor! For someone who’s not into science as a profession, I was more astounded by how funny and biting his humor was despite his condition. He was a paragon of how humor makes things bearable, and how indomitable the human spirit is if we choose it to be.
Yup. And he used it to remind late night hosts that they were never funny.  Truly a great man. 
Back in 2009 he threw a party for time travelers but only announced it afterwards to see if anyone from the future would take the bait and show up. *supposedly* no one did, but that was just the official statement.  *sniff*
"Imagine if someone had just come by by chance, and Hawking would act really suspicious like ""Suuure... you just came by for 'milk and flour'."""
Or maybe the party was full of time travellers that made him promise to play it cool.
That hurts, it means he was probably into the start of another project, a project he will never see the end of. It reminds me of the picture of Einstines messy desk after he died, what could have been if all those projects had come to fruition. What was lost as those projects ended, or were unable to be completed by others.
You’d be hard pressed to find an author with a wider range of content covered in their novels.  10th century Vikings, a diamond expedition in the Congo, reproducing dinosaurs from fossilised DNA, sexual harassment in the workplace, time travel, corporatisation of medical research, to describe but a few... just an amazing body of work.  One of my favourite experiences of his was reading The Andromeda Strain, where scientists find an extraterrestrial microbe in the desert. I read it in the early 2000s and thought it felt pretty modern. Was so shocked to read that he published it in 1969.  
It didn’t help that he was 76 years old.  Age complicates things quite a bit.
His survival is more likely down to the specific nature of his illness than the treatment he got. Although he always had great conditions. Another famous person who has similar ALS to Stephen Hawking is Jason Becker, he got it in his early 20s in the late 80s just as he was about to reach his peak as a guitar player, he's still around and he still writes music using only his eyes.
I have a sister that was given less than a month to live since her birth and spend the entire time drooling in a wheelchair. Shes currently approaching twenty and has a job in tech security. The biggest factors were a lot more care and focus and the constant patience to keep doing enough patience, but another thing was to keep her brain constantly functioning, like moving/massaging her legs and fingers as an infant and young child. Personally, I think that Hawking did something similar by constantly keeping his brain active instead of turning into a bored slump and eventual husk of a man. I have no idea if keeping the brain busy could be a factor, but it does seem to be a common thing I see for people who shouldn't be alive or are very, very old. 
With all due respect, as a Layman I recognized the name Hawking immediately but not the other two. 
It depends on what you mean by influential. If you just mean physics, he isn't really that close to them. I can name 10 others that are more influential to physics as a whole than Hawking.   That being said, I would say Hawking was equally as impressive as those names considering what he had to deal with regard to ALS. So for inspiring the next generation, he certainly has them beat. 
I think his humour is what reminded us that he was human. When he made a joke, you would always see a smirk on his face.  Without his humour it would be easy to forget he was human 1. To stereotype a genius mind that they must be on the spectrum and that if you’re on the spectrum you don’t ‘get’ humour. 2. Speaking through a computer and having very little mobility, you could easily forget that he wasn’t just an AI.
There even are pictures (iirc) of Einstein laying on a hospital bed during the last hours of his life with a notebook and a pen, trying to fulfill his dream of discovering a single, unifying equation that could describe the whole universe. Sadly, he didn't have enough time.
I didn't realize he was already 76, his condition made him look ageless in a way. I'm a little less sad, 76 is ok to go IMO.
I hope I make it to age 76.  Even without ALS living to your seventies isn’t a guarantee.  
ALS has to one of the most bastardly diseases known...  Good on him for battling and continuing to write. I have to be honest if I got this diagnosis, I'd probably hike into the woods, get ragingly drunk one last time, and eat my pistol.   These guys are a different kind of strong, stronger than me. 
And you also recognize deGrasse Tyson, who has done nothing to advance the field of physics other than call attention to it. Name recognition does not equal accolades. 
Hawking also gets a bunch of bonus points for his reach - so many more know of him than many other physicists, so he did great advertising for physics.   What I mean is, even if he's not in the top 10 physicists in strictly doing physics, he's certainly in the top 10 when you combine the physics work with getting his own and others work known to the general population. He seemed very accessible to me.
Like frantically trying to fill in the last questions to an exam... That must have been frustrating.
I wanted to stand on the same stage as him, as one of the scientists   i respect.... maybe if I succeed in this life, I'll be able to stand next to him in history books... 
ALS is still a debilitating disease with no known cure. Though there are drugs which can slow down progression of the illness, we can't reverse the symptoms. Most people diagnosed with ALS die within a few years. Most likely if Stephen Hawking were 20 years younger he would have been treated the same (can't say for sure as I don't know the details of his treatment).
Follow your dreams. He edited and added commentary to the writings of the greats who came before him in his book On the Shoulders of Giants, maybe you can be the next rung on that ladder.
I know plenty of students still in university who have published papers.
Yes, follow your dreams, but don't think you have failed in life if you don't accomplish them.   > maybe if I succeeded in this life     You can have a wonderful live without being remembered in history books. Success is not only being a genius or very rich. There are many other important things in life that you may be missing while following a dream of grandeur that is not even realistic.
If they publish papers in reputable venues then they do advance science. The fact that they are university students isn’t a factor (I’m also in research/academia and that’s my take).
Yes you could truthfully say that both Neil Degrasse Tyson and countless uni students have advanced our understanding of science, but it's to a different level of degree than Stephen Hawking which I feel was the original point the guy was making. Possibly agree to disagree though.
For those that are out of the loop, here's what going on:   https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/   Edit: To keep a little bit of science in every AskScience post, here's a neat color photograph of Pluto and Charon taken by the New Horizons spacecraft:   http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Science-Photos/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=191
Here's to hoping r/funny joins in the solidarity. 
You could always do what /r/listentothis did and disable posting for the time being.
I'd go private, the admins won't read this post, and going private will prove a point to the admins (hopefully) that revenue is not the heart of this site.
for a good idea of who is shutting down: https://np.reddit.com/live/v6d0vi6c8veb its not just major subs
As a mod of /r/shittyaskscience, I'm in a bit of a pickle. We expected /r/askscience to go dark. With that being the case, we'd of course stay open. But now this subreddit has chosen to stay open. Naturally, I have to shut down /r/shittyaskscience. I don't even know how to make a subreddit private, though. Do I like, just delete the entire thing?
This is not normal reddit drama. Hundreds of subs are going dark. The problems they perceive have reached a boiling point and they have said enough, time for something to give. If you, as a whole, honestly agree with the reasons they are going private then you should either go private as well or just stay out of it completely. This is a movement based on action, they aren't looking for cheerleaders.
I just wantted to say, I laughed at your extra science link and actually looked at the picture. Well done :) 
You did a really good job. You should get fired for it 
Yeah, should really just go private.
And then never goes un-private again
"I think this is a good way to go for subs not wanting to go dark/private. By disallowing submissions, and keeping a stickied announcement post, the subs can become effectively ""private read-only"" without disrupting what's already occurred or concealing any information about what's actively going on. I've noticed a lot of the ""rising"" posts in /r/all have people completely confused because their defaults are now private (which I personally think is the way to go for *some defaults* to make a statement) but if the more popular subs, that aren't directly tied in with the issue, decide nuke the ability to submit, it seems just as effective."
As a mod of /r/science, and arguably one of the instigators of all of this, I'm ok with AskScience staying up, it's the tradition of AskScience not to get involved in the politics of reddit.
I really hope to see Victoria back, don't know how, don't know when. It's kinda incredible that LORRI field of view is 0.29 degrees wide.
If you really want to hurt the Admins, withhold the Au. FTFY (and thank you for the links)
/r/funny going private would be pretty funny.  So of course, it will never go private.
Ironic that the best use of reddit live is to watch reddit die.
"She's posted a few times in other subs, I'm sure she will be around but not in her same capacity. Did you know that Saturn's Rings are some of the ""flattest"" structures known to mankind? They are over 300,000km long but only have a ""thickness"" of around 10meters! "
Victoria won't come back. She'd be a fool to go back to a job where they didn't respect or appreciate her in the first place.
I want to see every single default closed. The admins have gone too far.
/r/pics just did
"Reddit admins dun goofed, unlike the [Ralph instrument on New Horizons](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft/Payload.php), which is operating at nominal capacity and will soon send us a dazzling night-side view of Pluto illuminated by ""Charon-light"", which is what they call moonlight on the dwarf planet."
Much the way Female Angler fish don't acknowledge their former mates which shrivel up and remain with their former partners as parasites.
Apparently those looking for alternatives to reddit have been directed to check out voat.co, which is funny because goats (along with sheep, toads and octopuses) have evolved [rectangular pupils](http://i.imgur.com/XyKyo0K.jpg) as a survival trait  to survey their surroundings more accurately, as the narrower the pupil in relation to the horizon, the greater the depth perception is in the peripheral vision of the animal.
This thread is killing me, unlike the lobster which many claim is effectively immortal.
While users look for alternatives to the site and have offered best wishes to Victoria, it's ironic that one way they have shown their support for her is through purchasing gold, with proceeds going directly to Reddit.  Gold is more than just a material for jewelry and a medium of exchange.  A radioactive isotope of the metal [has even been studied for use in cancer treatment by targeting prostate tumors](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120716152300.htm).  But buying gold for Victoria just sends a conflicted message.
What does its immortality have to do with the lobster not killing you?
We all need to come together and set up a No Reddit day.  This place relies on Web traffic.  One day where you don't come to reddit.  You don't post, you don't comment, you don't lurk.  Show the admins this place can go down like MySpace.   /r/JustsayNope
Sure. Sociologically speaking, pupils from more economically affluent areas tend to have an advantage over those from less affluent schools. From an evolutionary standpoint, it is likely they will pass that advantage onto their offspring.
No he means it isn't killing the lobsters. Cuz they are immortal.   Which, by the way, is a super interesting thing that I'd like to hear more about because I had no idea.
This is my favorite protest I've ever seen on reddit.  Though the lobster isn't my favorite long-lived animal.  And I say long-lived because we don't know for sure that the lobster is immortal, we just don't know for sure that they die of old age ever.  It's an exciting field!  On the other hand some species of jellyfish *are* effectively immortal, able to revert back to an early phase and start their life cycle over!  Hopefully reddit can do that too and go back to its old ideals!
Negligible senescence. Basically no measurable degeneration while aging, unlike reddit.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible_senescence 
"Hmm, lots of incomplete answers here.  Take a look at [this graph](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth103/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.earth103/files/module03/fig8sol.png) of solar intensity vs latitude.  As you can see, the summer pole receives about as much sunlight as the equator (actually, slightly more because of the 24-hour days in the arctic circle!).  On the other hand, there's a huge difference in energy provided to the equator vs the completely dark winter pole.   As a result, there's a huge difference in temperature between the winter pole and the equator, and not so much between the summer pole and equator.  But that just explains changes in temperature vs *latitude*, not changes over time, so let's think about weather systems.  Storms are created by the north-south temperature gradient: as heat moves from equator to pole, a small amount of it is converted into kinetic energy.  Heat flow causes motion, just like a very inefficient steam or gasoline engine.  When the temperature difference is large, the ""engine"" runs faster and more efficiently, creating more kinetic energy -- which is to say the storm winds blow stronger when the pole-equator temperature difference is large.  So.  In the wintertime, the difference in solar heating creates a much larger equator-pole temperature difference than in the summer.  This creates much stronger wind patterns.  So you've got stronger winds, blowing a bigger temperature gradient around across the surface of the Earth ... so you see much bigger temperature shifts from day to day.  Edited to add some examples.  Here are views of temperatures and winds at the 500 mbar level [in northern hemisphere summer](https://earth.nullschool.net/#2017/08/19/1800Z/wind/isobaric/500hPa/overlay=temp/orthographic=-66.65,42.29,316) (last August 19) and [northern hemisphere winter](https://earth.nullschool.net/#2018/02/19/1800Z/wind/isobaric/500hPa/overlay=temp/orthographic=-66.65,42.29,316) (yesterday).  Colors indicate temperature contrast (purple is colder), streaks indicate wind direction and speed."
The summer equivalent to a warm winter day would be a cold night.  Summer in many climates is quite humid.  On a cool night, the temperature will often drop to the dew point or a little below, and dew will drop out of the air.  A phase change from water vapor to liquid water entails removing a larger amount of energy than just changing the temperature, and so the temperature tends to stop dropping fast when it hits the dew point.    If the temperature had been able to drop lower overnight, the next day wouldn't get nearly as warm and could be like a winter day.  Deserts typically get colder at night than similarly warm humid places.  Part of that is the lack of cloud cover but part of of it also the lack of this dew point clamping effect.
In Australia - where there's ocean to the south of us all the way to Antarctica - we can get cold fronts during the middle of summer that can bring freezing conditions at altitude, e.g. [like this event in 2006.](https://www.theage.com.au/news/national/victorias-white-christmas/2006/12/25/1166895228377.html) Like /u/TheRealNooth and /u/seasaltandpepper explained, to the north of the US is a landmass which transfers heat more quickly than water, thus it doesn't have the chance to remain cool in summer or warm in winter like the Southern Ocean does.
It actually does happen. Ok, the first one that came in my mind wasn’t in summer, it was in May. But same idea.   “Temperatures have plummeted in the past two days from 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday to 0.3 degrees Celsius on Monday.  (.....) However forecasts for the next few days predict temperatures soaring back above 20 degrees Celsius. “   https://www.sott.net/article/245456-First-Time-in-50-Years-Snow-Hits-Bosnian-Capital
In the U.S. Midwest you have the cold Arctic to the North of you and the warm Tropics to the South of you. In the higher latitudes (north), you have a winter where it is pretty much always cold. Arctic winters don't have warm winter days like in the Midwest. In the tropics it is pretty much always summer. It is hot year-round.  During a Midwest winter sometimes the air will blow down from the north and be very cold, but sometimes it will blow from the south and be warmer. There might be a 100F difference or more between northern Canada and the equator. Cold northern winter air and warm tropical air meet in the middle and we experience some of that large temperature difference.  During a Midwest summer, the same thing happens except that the arctic is now also experiencing summer. Northern Canada is now warmer so there might only be a 40F difference between northern Canada and the equator. The midwest still experiences some cooler air traveling down from the north, but it isn't nearly as cool, so we don't experience nearly as large a difference in temperature.  The other factor involved is exactly where the cold arctic air and the warm tropical air meet. In the winter, they meet much further south while in the summer they meet farther north. This boundary is basically the polar front jet stream, which you can see from this [diagram](https://climate.ncsu.edu/images/edu/polar_front_summer_winter.jpg) is located further south in the winter. You can view the current jet stream maps [here](http://squall.sfsu.edu/gif/jetstream_init_00.gif). You can compare that to this [map](http://www.intellicast.com/National/Temperature/Current.aspx) which shows generally warmer temperatures south of the jet stream and colder temperatures north of the jet stream. 
That website is awesome. Somehow made it all through University geography without knowing that exists.
I've been looking at your graph for ten minutes and I still have no idea what's going on. What is the blue line? What is the red line? Where are these poles you're talking about? What portions of this graph are the temperature differences you're talking about? 
"Back when I was studying meteorology in the early 90s, there were no web sites. Instead, national and world weather maps were faxed every 4 hours to thousands of sites around the US by the National Weather Service. Receiving sites had to have a fax machine printing operating 24/7.  A guy in our department had the primary job of pulling the faxes out -- 30 or 40 with each cycle -- and mounting them up on a big board in our main lobby. He even had to mount the ones received overnight, because in order to see weather trends you had to flip through the last 24 or 48 hours of maps. That's how we produced an ""animated"" weather map."
[Windy.com](https://www.windy.com/) will blow your mind. Wind, waves, gusts, weather forecasting, and so much more. Pretty damn accurate (as weather forecasting can be) too.
You can still receive weather fax via shortwave radio: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/software/multimode/fax.html
Nope, time dilation is a cool part of special relativity. At 99.9% the speed of light the trip would be 0.17 ish years to the occupants of the spaceship. The closer you get to 100%, ie. add more 9’s to the end of your percentage, the faster the trip would feel to the occupants. Here’s a cool calculator site you can play with to see these effects. http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/#.XESiMRZlCEc  -edit This seems to be a frequent question and it’s a good one. How would you age? The traveler would age relative to the time they experience. So on this trip while everyone on earth experienced 4 years, you’d only age a few months! Take a long enough trip and you might just outlive your own grandchildren!   -edit2 Time dilation has been proven experimentally using very precise measurements. Here's a link to an article for some further reading. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einsteins-time-dilation-prediction-verified/  Also, as some have pointed out, it would take a long time to accelerate to these speeds at 1g and would require a HUGE amount of energy to do so. Definitely not practical with current propulsion technologies. I have heard that large solar sails might be able to accelerate small probes to high speeds 20-30% c which would be a cool thing to see.   -edit3 For those curious about the solar sail probe, if you google StarShot you’ll find a lot of info about it. https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/3  -edit4 As many have pointed out, time dilation is a direct result of the length contraction observed by the traveling body. Also, thanks for for the gifts kind strangers.  -edit5 Another fun link thanks to /u/konstantinua00 talking about relativistic effects on mission duration http://convertalot.com/relativistic_star_ship_calculator.html
The [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) factor is (1 - f^2 )^0.5 , where f is the fraction of light speed.  (This means that the ~~experienced travel time~~ **time that passes inside the ship** approaches 0 as f approaches 1. If you could travel arbitrarily close to light speed, you would experience the journey as effectively instantaneous.)  Here's a calculator for it: http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/  At .999c (99.9% light speed) it calculates that time is slowed down to 4.47% of the outside value. That means four years are experienced as approximately 65 days.  Edit: fixed the wording. This is literally the time that passes for the ship. It affects everything, from atomic clocks to metabolisms to brain activity.
"Yes, time would pass slower aboard the ship than it would appear to from our perspective.  For a fixed duration 4 year journey at a constant speed (no acceleration or deceleration)  At 99.9% C only 65 days would pass from the perspective of the crew  At 99.9999999999% of C only 3 minutes would pass from the perspective of the crew  A 4ly distance traveling at 100%, 99.9999999999% and 99.9% C from earths perspective would take 4 years, 4 years ~1 day, 4years ~2 days respectively.  Edit: It doesn't *just* ""feel"" like 65 days / 3 minutes passes. That's how much time actually passes from that frame of reference. Time (and space) is literally dilated. You would only age by that amount, you would only need to eat that amount of food, because that is the amount of time that has elapsed."
Another good fictional example of time dilation can be found in the Ender Quintet (the first five books of the [series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(series))  that began with Ender's Game). Basically, boy wins war and leaves on a colony ship to meet the descendents of the soldiers he commanded to win the war, with only like two years having passed for him.
Interesting fact I read somewhere, astronauts who have spent any substantial time on the ISS are actually a few seconds? (Can't remember exactly how much) younger than if they had stayed on earth. All relative of course.
Every few months I read something about time dilation then end up going down a rabbit hole until I finally have a very basic understanding of how it works. Then I spend a few days contemplating existence. Then, because I'm not very smart, I forget exactly how it all works, and forget about it at all. Then, a few months later, I read something about time dilation.  Thanks, Reddit. I was looking forward to the next week of my life.
The time dilation factor (Lorentz Factor) can be calculated by the equation: 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 ).  Note that v/c is your speed relative to the speed of light (.999 in this case).  For a speed of .999c, we get a Lorentz factor of 22.37    This means that for every 22.37 years in the reference frame of Earth, one year occurs in the reference frame of the spaceship.    This is not a mere illusion or change in how time is experienced, but an actual dilation of space-time.  Relative velocity causes dilation in spacetime, leading to many counter intuitive phenomena.  One of my favourites is that events that are simultaneous in one reference frame are not necessarily simultaneous in another.
Your wording is confusing. It wouldn't just feel like .17 years for the traveller. It would actually be .17 years.  People below are asking if they would need to eat 4 years of food during this time. No, only .17 years would pass in the space ship.  
>Also, as some have pointed out, it would take a long time to accelerate to these speeds at 1g and would require a HUGE amount of energy to do so.  What a lot of people don't realize is that it would also take an equal amount of time to **decelerate** from 99.9% of the speed of light. Most likely, you would spend half the trip accelerating and the next half decelerating.  
"If the speed of light is an absolute in any frame of reference, how is this possible? From the perspective of passengers on that ship, crossing four light years in 65 days significantly surpasses the speed of light (yes, I understand that from a ""neutral"" vantage point the trip still takes four years). Does that mean that, for those on the ship, since their maximum velocity is still *c*, the distance traveled is compressed? "
If a radio message was sent from earth at lightspeed to the spaceship, when would the crew receive it?
Also a fun time dilation book - The Forever War, by Joe Haldeman https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forever_War
Yeah, although they should be a few seconds older because of time passing faster higher up the gravity well, the speed of the ISS slows down time slightly more.
So you’d spend half the trip accelerating and the other half decelerating then? And that’s with a fairly aggressive 10g. That’s wild. 
Good point! I’ll replace the the “feels like” with a better descriptive 
The latter. It's not some psychological effect, time actually goes relatively slower for them.
You're forgetting that speed is a function of distance over time. Distance is relative between two time frames. Light works normally for those aboard the ship, the universe just squeezes together so that they can pass that distance without violating the speed of light relative to their own time frame.
People on the ship will have aged by 65 days, but everyone on Earth would have aged 4 years.  
Nope. There is no fixed clock in the Universe. Only 3 minutes of time (each way) will pass for those at speed. 4 years (each way) will pass on Earth.
Can you help me understand the definition of 4 light years?  My understanding is that it means it takes light 4 years to travel that distance.  Help me understand how another object that needs 4 years to travel said distance at light speed would have occupants in it that beleive it is only .17 years, when in fact the object took 4 earth years to get to its destination.
"With interstellar travel, if you put people on the spaceship your thrust should be about 1g. This will provide artificial gravity, incidentally. To reach 0.97c @ 1g acceleration would take the *ship* two years, and it would have gone 2.9 light years. Remember that Alpha Centauri is 4ly away, so you would actually want to start decelerating when you have traveled 2ly. You could either have a set of engines opposing the acceleration engines or you could make the spacecraft tumble 180° and begin boosting in the opposite direction.   1g is the most desirable acceleration for *human* spacecraft because the journey will take a long time, and people are acclimated to 1g. You could boost more - 1.5g shouldn't be too much for people who are in good physical condition. Your average 150lb adult would ""weigh* 225lbs, which isn't overly stressful on their body. And, if your destination planet has a gravity field greater than Earth's, you could spend the voyage acclimating the passengers to the gravity of the planet they'll be settling.  For a *robotic* spaceship, the acceleration limits are loads greater. A robot can be built to withstand thousands of g forces. The biggest issue is fuel. You need so much fuel to be constantly boosting during your journey that it becomes exceptionally impractical to build such a device."
does the universe *actually* squeeze together or are you using that as an illustration?
This hurts my brain for some reason. How fast do radio transmissions go? Isn’t it slower than light speed?
4 light years is the distance light travels in 4 years from our point of view. From the point of view of the light, its arriving instantaneously. Same goes for the craft, its traveling and only requires .17 years, but from our static view on earth it would appear the craft traveled for a little over 4 years.
Just like how time is relative, distance (and mass) are also relative.  So for those people on the ship, the distance is actually shorter.  Neither the people on the ship nor the stationary observers are the “correct” ones.  They just have different frames of reference, and according to relativity, there are no privileged frames of reference.
People on Earth would be 4 years older by the time your first 65 days were up - when you came back to earth (another 65 days for you) the people on Earth would be 4 years older still (8 years older in total)  [Relevant song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud6LiVJkwyA&t=0s&list=FL80HwL7XdLXfIe0B9nvVzqw&index=25)
No, radio waves are the same as visible light, gamma rays, microwaves and others simply differing in frequenzy. They all travel at the speed of light (through a vacuum)
Hold on, hold on, this is frying my brain a bit. So are you saying that if the craft were traveling at the speed of light then it would arrive, as far as the occupants are concerned, instantaneously? But for us it would appear to take them 4 years?  Would that not mean then that we could travel anywhere instantaneously if we could reach the speed of light from the perspective of the occupants of a craft?  Or are you defining this from the perspective of an observer on Earth?  I'm thinking about the whole Einstein clock scenario, whereby a traveler leaves earth at 12:00:00, travels at the speed of light for 1 second away from earth and then looks at the clock. It will still say 12:00:00 but in actual fact the travelers have traveled for 1 second in my head and to an observer on Earth the clock will say 12:00:01.  So I get that if they were to travel 4 years away instead of 1 second that, looking back at the clock it will still say 12:00:00 on the date 4 years earlier, but the occupants have still been traveling for 4 years haven't they despite the clock saying this? It's only people on Earth who would see the clock as 12:00:00 but on a date 4 years after the launch. 
Yes, if we could reach the speed of light we could instantaneously arrive anywhere in the universe from the point of view of the person travelling at light speed.  However, objects with mass cannot travel at light speed (light itself has no mass because it's made of photons which don't). The gist of it is that as objects with mass travel faster, they get heavier. At light speed, they would have an infinite amount of mass, which would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate. 
The clock on the ship would record 130 days elapsed time, while an identical clock on Earth would record 8 years. Both clocks would be correct.  Special Relativity is mind blowing.
"So this is not my area of expertise and I hope other more qualified people chime in but I have found some informations (some of it even peer reviewed!).   [This article [1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-011-0515-5) talks about how four legged animals are more vulnerable to lightning strikes because ground current has high chances to go through vital organs. It also describes how large animals such as giraffes and elephants have higher chances of deadly strikes. There is the obvious thing about the fact that they are tall so even under a tree there is a non-negligeable chance that lighting could [jump directly to their head](http://i.imgur.com/iYzL85H.png). The other less obvious one is that even if they are not directly hit, the large distance their legs span increased the voltage (and potentially the current) going though them (as described in[ this figure](http://i.imgur.com/JkPWM1K.png)). Sadly the article lacks hard numbers on strike frequency depending on the species.   This [blog post](http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/07/15/mammal-deaths-by-lightning/) seems to suggest that giraffes getting killed by lightning is not that uncommon.   > Between 1996 and 1999 the Rhino and Lion Reserve near Krugersdorp, South Africa, had two of its three giraffes killed by lightning – the third animal (a juvenile) was also struck but survived. Betsy the giraffe was killed by lightning at Walt Disney World in Florida in 2003 (in front of lots of witnesses).  ...  >  A juvenile giraffe at Louisiana’s Global Wildlife Center, named Dusty, was killed after lightning struck a nearby tree.   [1] Gomes, Chandima. ""Lightning safety of animals."" International journal of biometeorology 56.6 (2012): 1011-1023."
Thanks for all of the info, guys. I posted this after waking up from a dream in which giraffes were being struck by lightning, of all things.
There was a study done at one of the game parks here in South Africa regarding the susceptibility of giraffes to lightning. It was found that a lot of the deaths attributed to lightning were actually caused by snake bites , Black Mamba's hunt birds in tree tops and the giraffes get fatal bites because they browse in the same  area. I live a few kilometers from the lion park mentioned and it has a very high strike rate because of the terrain layout and elevation. Johannesburg has one of the highest lightning strike rates in the world generally.
Giraffes get struck by lightning more often because they are the tallest standing object in an open area...  People will talk all day about biochemistry and whatnot, but I'm an electrical engineer and I can tell you that they are struck by lightning more solely because they are the shortest path to ground.    
It's also important to remember many of these (with the african elephant anyways, not sure about indian) are Savannah animals where there are rarely trees which come close to their height. I would imagine they would be like giant lightning rods  
I'm really sad for Brachiosaurus now. 
I'm glad you asked it, it's never occurred to me but some very interesting answers.
Will one snake bite kill a fully grown giraffe?
I remember a few years ago a giraffe was killed by lightning at the Fort Worth Zoo
But this makes me wonder, is being struck by lightning not an evolutionary pressure? Are there few enough lightning strikes on giant lightning rods on the flat Savannah that it doesn't matter that they're tall?
Brachiosaurus was much taller than a giraffe. At least nowadays, trees as tall as Brachiosaurus' head tend to grow in dense forests where there would be more shelter from lightning.
"What a magnificently ridiculous world we live in. ""The sky's shooting electricity at the 20 foot tall animals - that we brought half way around the world to look at - again, time to put them in large boxes for the night."""
A black mamba isn't just any snake. It's highly venomous and so fast that it can deliver multiple bites in one attack.
From my rough numbers (and I could totally be doing this wrong), I don't think so. The LD50 for a subcutaneous bite, which is the most applicable in this situation, is 0.32 mg/kg. An adult male giraffe weighs around 1360 kilograms. My number came out to be 435mg of venom needed. A Black Mamba bite tends to be 100 to 120 mg. So maybe if it got multiple bites? Not an expert, just bored at work. 
"This is very much a generalized, self-referential answer, but:   The evolution benefit of being as tall as they are (access to food sources unreachable by others, farther vision, etc.) may outweigh the detriment (in this case, being killed by lightening), if giraffe population height isn't changing due to lightening strikes over time.      ------  We have to keep in mind that ""reproductive fitness"" does not optimize for a single variable, characteristic, part of anatomy, or behavior, other than overall successful reproduction itself, which is a multi-component thing.    In almost all cases, multiple evolutionary pressures are happening simultaneously, and sometimes these pressures even conflict with each other (higher height = more access to food, but higher height also = possibly more chance of being killed by lightening, more energy expended to grow to that height, etc.).    To see whether the benefit is outweighing the detriment, or whether lightening strike deaths are a limiting factor on giraffe height, or other conclusions, we would need some hard statistical data on the subject, something like: how often giraffes of different heights, at what age and with how many offspring, etc., are dying from it.    Keep in mind that given how uncommon and difficult to observe the event is (a migratory animal that exists in relatively low numbers, interacting with lightening), no one may have collected this type of data yet.  "
Maybe being struck by lightning *is* an evolutionary pressure and without it giraffes would be hundreds of feet tall.
Not only that, they are know as the deadliest snakes on earth, they *will* chase you if you piss them off.
LD50 will be species specific and for a large animal, the proximity to target organs will be very important. 
"Thinking about it there comes the issue to mind that we tend to ""hide"" during storms and even if we do not we are seldom the tallest thing.  Can these big animals ""hide"" themselves from lighting in the Savannah? Is there anything taller than them acting as a lighting rod?  As far as i can think about it it seems like they should be way more likely to be hit in a storm than a human. But i might overlook something."
Yeah, but North Americans usually stay inside a building, a car or other safe locations during thunderstorms.
Every time a Redditor *actually* understands evolution an angel gets it's wings.
There is a thing about cows sitting down in the rain, I wonder if this is to do with lightning, the lower to the ground you are the less likely you are to be hit.
Also, selective pressure is further reduced if the animal has already at reproduction age.  If the selective pressure is a function of height, and height is a function of age, and reproduction is a function of age then in theory animals struck by lightning are more likely to have already reproduced at least once.
Every time a Redditor misuses an apostrophe, an angel's wings are brutally torn from their back.
I can testify to this, all the cattle I have worked with do have a tendency to find the lee/shelter of a hillside and lay down. I have only seen this while it's raining or snow, never when its storming overhead with out rain and heavy winds.  I'm interested in knowing if this was isolated to the ranch I worked or is it common. 
"It's pretty common. Here in Texas cows *will not* move during storms unless they* absolutely have to. This has led to quite a few cows in my area getting stuck on ""islands"" of higher ground during flash floods because they refused to do the smart thing and move"
Cows are indeed problematic in this regard. I have read that during the floods in The Netherlands in 1953, most of the cows in flooded areas died but many horses survived because they left their shelter to climb onto nearby dikes.
If you sit down before it rains, you'll be sitting on a dry patch.  Sitting on a dry patch of ground rather than a wet one probably prevents thermal losses.
"Your question made me curious and a quick search yielded the study linked below, which looked at exactly this question.^1 The researchers found that the answer depends both on the variant of the exercise as well as the stage of the exercise. For example, in a traditional push-up the number is about 69% in the up position (at the top of the movement) and 75% in the down position (bottom of the movement).  It's also worth mentioning that the study also looked at a ""modified push-up."" This modification [as shown here](https://i.imgur.com/2PagQIv.png) is essentially just an ~~lazier~~ easier version of the exercise where the knees stay on the floor.  Surprisingly (to me at least), even in this simpler version you still lift quite a bit of your body mass (54% in the up position and 62% in the down position).  edit: I corrected ""going up/down"" to ""up/down position"" to reflect the fact the body was kept stationary when the force was recorded in this study.  ^(**1**) Suprak, et al. **The effect of position on the percentage of body mass supported during traditional and modified push-up variants.** 2011: 25 (2) pp 497-503 *J. Strength Cond. Res.* [Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20179649)"
To measure yourself: Put a bathroom scale under one of your hands while doing a push up. Double the maximum value the scale lists and divide that by your total weight (and multiple by 100) to calculate the percentage.
So I wonder if it works in reverse? If you want to improve push ups by bench pressing. Say you are 250 lb at 75% that's 187.5 lb. Could you then work on a set with say 190 lb over period Of time and increase your stamina for push ups push up effectively
Just for fun to check the people giving you numbers, you can put your feet on a scale (easier since they're less wide apart) and ask a buddy to read off the number at the top and the bottom. Hold still at the top, get the number, then hold still at the bottom and get the number. The difference between your weight and the weight on your feet is the weight on your hands. 
You can also modify pushups in the other direction, making them significantly harder (mostly through increased leverage):    * hands together pushups   * forward lean pushups (putting your center of gravity forward, increasing both leverage on shoulders and total body mass lifted)   * decline pushups (mentioned by others) * handstand pushups   * planche    Note: at no point do you lift 100% of your own body mass, since your hands and forearms are always at rest and all of the motion is above the elbow.   Edit: body segment weight data as measured by Paolo de Leva says that hands and forearms average [4.46% of body weight for men, and 3.88% for women](http://www.exrx.net/Kinesiology/Segments.html).

Thanks! I appreciate you. 
"""70% going up and 75% going down"" Odd I never seem to have a problem going down, but up again is  a diffrent case.  Edit: Maybe i Should have made it clearer that it was a joke. Obviously the descent is easier with the help of gravity, I understand that resisting it and slowly lowering yourself is harder."
I weigh 220. How come it's pretty easy to do push-ups, but benching 160+ is a struggle?
Hold yourself up in a push up position with your hands on the scales to measure.
Important to put a book or something that is equal in height as the scale under the other hand
Bench press will definitely make you better at push-ups, but as with most exercises, the best way to get better at it is to just do more of it. Bench press works slightly different muscles than push ups do, so you'd probably be better off just doing push up variations if your goal is to simply improve push up stamina. 
Someone doing handstand pushups is probably lifting over 90% body mass though, right?
That's not odd. You're applying less force when you go down. Which is why you go down.
Could be partly form (wider grip = uses more of your chest, narrower grip = uses more of your triceps) and the fact that the ground is locked firmly into place, you don't need to use your stabilizer muscles as much. Similar to how you can leg press way more than you can squat.
1. You're doing less range of motion with pushups. 2. You don't need to balance anything. Pushups are a closed-chain exercise. 3. Pushups are more similar to a decline bench press, in which people usually lift more
You can just put both hands on the scale. The pushups are harder with your hands together, but the weight would be about the same.
And in a more mechanically disadvantageous position. That's more of the difficulty than the added 15-20% bodyweight(which really won't be a significant weight difference unless you are quite heavy).
It would have taken me longer than I'd like to admit to have considered that aspect of it.  Gravity makes it easier...
That's what I thought at first, but then you'd have your hands closer together, therefore increasing your angle and shifting your weight in an other way when compared to a normal wide stance         Ninja edit: just tested this out and the difference is either unexisting or negligible. Go for both hands on scale!
It's also different muscle groups used.  A traditional pushup is mostly your pectorals and triceps where as a handstand pushup moves the stress to your deltoid and triceps.  Your deltoids are traditionally much weaker muscles than your pectorals.
Muscles are the strongest at eccentric motions, then isometric and lastly concentric. The going down part is eccentric, holding a position would be isometric and going back up is concentric.
In a roundabout way you could put your feet on the scale then subtract that amount from your body weight.
Would a handstand pushup be the equivalent of a bodyweight shoulder press?
When you do a shoulder press, your muscles are actually displacing the weights, your arms, and your hands, so you're actually lifting more than your body weight.  On the other hand, when you do a handstand pushup, you're not displacing all of your body (your hands don't move), so you're not really lifting your entire body weight.
> more than your body weight  Sorry, but how exactly? Surely a good 75-80% of your body is below you arms and not being lifted.
I think ZaberTooth means that in the situation you are shoulder pressing your own body weight (say you weigh 200lbs, so you're shoulder pressing 200lbs in weights) you are also lifting the weight of your arms, so it is actually above 200lbs.   Another way to look at it: 200lbs in Barbell/dumbells weight + arms > 200lbs.
The reason for the different styles is cost and torque. The slotted head screws are cheap and easy to make. But they're completely useless for powered screwdrivers and you can't put much torque on the screw without it either slipping out or stripping the head (and maring the surface of whatever you're screwing). Phillips screws are self-centering, making powered screwdrivers possible. They're somewhat more expensive to produce than slotted-head. They tend to 'cam-out' easily under torque, making it hard to apply much torque. I've heard they were designed that way to prevent overtightning. However, it's not good for exposed fasteners to look stripped. Robertson-head and allen-head fasteners can handle more torque than phillips-head fasteners, but are more expensive. Because the bottom of the hole is flat (unlike the pointed end of the phillips), there's more contact area and so it's less likely to cam-out. The robertson-head is cheaper than the allen-head, but the allen-head has six points of contact rather than 4, making it less prone to rounding out the hole. The Torx-head fasteners solve the problem of rounding/stripping by having the flat bottom of the robertson/allen that reduces cam-out, but it has much better contact with the driving bit to prevent stripping the head. The points of the 'star' on the driving bit engage the recesses on the screw at nearly right angles, so it has a very positive contact. Torx is becoming more and more popular because of that, particularly in assembly-line work. Because they're less likely than a phillips to be damaged when tightening, the allen (internal hex) heads are often used for exposed ('decorative') fasteners on 'some assembly required' furniture. It's also very cheap to make the allen keys, so they usually include one with the fasteners. 
You've got some good answers here already, but they're all leaving out an important aspect, which is how the screw and screwdriver deal with fouling. Dirt, oil, weld slag, multiple layers of paint, whatever. If you're in an environment where you don't have to worry about that, a complex geometry is fine. But on a factory floor, Phillips or torx can get irreversibly fouled. Allen head screws can be relatively easily cleaned, but the master of this is the shittiest of all screw heads, the flat head. The *only* tool you need to clear the slot of a flat head screw is the screwdriver you're going to use to unscrew it. No other screw type has that ability.
I think the core of your question has been answered, but I wanted to add one point.  Sometimes various screws are used for security reasons.  For instance on the products my company sells there are some screws we intend for the customer to undo, and we will use hex, slotted, or Phillips for these.  Other screws we don't want them messing with and may use Torx or something more rare.  In fact some companies specialize in making strange screw head shapes purely for security reasons, [as seen in this chart.](http://cdn.clm02.com/ezvivi.com/204050/6359362590222142198612765.jpg)
To add, universal standards are a hard thing to decide upon. Just look at how imperial units remain, despite the existence of SI units. People will have differing opinions on which type is the best, especially as the different head types have different mechanical and operating properties.      XKCD has relevant comic (as always)   [Standards](https://xkcd.com/927/)
One thing not mentioned is that some screws (e.g. Robertson) are better for automatic machine use than others.   For machines, it's best if you can load the screw onto the driver, then move the driver into position. But you need a screw that will hold onto the bit well enough to not fall off.  Others have mentioned Phillips bits and cam-out. This is desirable. For example: Drywall installers use special screw guns (and you can get drywall bits for regular drills) that will detatch from the screw at the right install depth. Handy for that application.  By the way, Robertson screws are really friggin awesome. They are just so great to work with in most applications. It's a global tragedy that they never became more widespread.
When I was a volunteer at the Buffalo Museum of Science, I worked in the carpentry shop helping to build displays as well as building repairs. The guy who ran the shop was a 40 year tradesman and the best finishing carpenter I have ever met. When he came on board the first thing he did was replace all our variety of screws for Robertsons. He claimed they were the best screws in the world. I now use nothing else.
> Robertson-head and allen-head fasteners can handle more torque than phillips-head fasteners, but are more expensive. Because the bottom of the hole is flat (unlike the pointed end of the phillips), there's more contact area and so it's less likely to cam-out.  While I thank you for bringing up Canada's contribution to the fastener world, a couple of things... Robertsons aren't Square-Drive.  While they're square in cross-section, the driver and the hole in the screw are slightly tapered, and the bottom rounded. This makes it much harder to strip a Robertson.   It also means that the screw can stick to the driver even when both are non-magnetic, which is really handy.

They tend to 'cam-out' easily under torque, making it hard to apply much torque. I've heard they were designed that way to prevent overtightning.  If you look up the patent for the phillips head you will find that the inventor did talk about ""cam-out"" as a benefit, but he was talking about the ability of the drive bit to force debris out of the screw head. It had nothing to do with ""cam-out"" as currently understood. It's a very common misconception.  See Chapter 2:  https://theses.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-42698-205111/  "
Naw, it's easier to strip allen head than Robertson, cause of corner angles being around 120-130 degrees or so, instead of ninety (and then the Robertson taper)
Didn't see any pictures so. Thought I would link this:  http://i.imgur.com/4nqvdrX.jpg   It has most the ones he was talking about.   Edit - wow, thanks for the gold, kind person!
> the master of this is the shittiest of all screw heads, the flat head. The only tool you need to clear the slot of a flat head screw is the screwdriver you're going to use to unscrew it. No other screw type has that ability.  Additionally you don't even need a screwdriver, just a flat tool sufficiently hard and of proper size.  This is why you see flathead on a lot of military firearms. You can take it apart & put it together with anything that will fit and be strong enough to not bend or break.  * Screwdriver * Knife * Medal * Metal button * Coin * another screw * etc. 
Amusingly a decent number of unconventional screws can be undone with a flathead of the right size.
"> If you look up the patent for the phillips head you will find that the inventor did talk about ""cam-out"" as a benefit  The original concept was invented by a John P Thompson. He couldn't gain any traction though, so sold it to Henry Phillips (Phillips Screw Company), at which point it was improved (somehow?) and then patented  We coulda been all been calling it a Thompson screw if he'd had a bit more acumen"
> Bonus points: IKEA includes a Phillips screwdriver with Pozidriv screws. Idiots.  Maybe a regional thing or something? I've bought plenty of IKEA furniture and never had *any* screwdriver included. Allen keys with everything but no screwdrivers. The pack of basic tools I got from there includes both Phillips and Pozidriv heads, though.
That's not a great example of standards being difficult. That's a great example of Ryobi being dicks. 
Only place I've ever seen them is electrical panels, where they are quite common
The hex has more points of contact, but the points of contact are being driven at a shallower angle. The strength of torx is that the points of cantact are being driven nearly parallel (0 degrees), whereas a Robertsons drives at 45 degrees and a hex drives at 60 degrees.
Security torx have a pretty serious weakness, though - The post actually *helps* you use a flathead between it and two of the sides, and still get plenty of torque (though directed slightly off-center) to turn the screw. 
I am an aircraft mechanic and my air frame uses Torx exlusively. The T20 bits strip out evveerrryy day. They are the bane of my existence. T30+ though and i'm in love.
"In Canada they're used all over the place.  If you go to Home Depot and pick up a tub of general ""construction screws"" they're going to be Robertson."
Did you use an impact driver? I've never even stripped a Phillips head holding brake rotors on with one of those.
I'm curious since you clearly have way more experience with torx, is it the bits that strip, or the screw heads? In addition to all the other benefits of torx, if the tendency is for bits to strip before the screws then that's even more of a benefit over Phillips or Allen. I'd much rather need to replace bits and have extras around than have stripped screws stuck in things that need to be drilled out...
It blows my mind that Philips would be used in the US in applications that are almost always Robertson in Canada
They call.them crow bar screws in the States. Because they don't have Robertsons, they use a crow bar to openthe  crates fastened with them. 
Nope. That thing was so freaking soft that if I had brought my impact driver out it would have stripped out of fear. 😆 
Most hand sanitizers use alcohol, which kills indiscriminately.  It would kill us if we didn't have livers to filter it, and in high enough doses will kill anyway.  Some germs survive due to randomly being out of contact, in nooks and crannies and such, not due to any mechanism that might be selected for.
Sanitizers almost always use alcohol, which bacterial cells don’t really have any cellular means of developing resistance against.  You may as well worry about developing resistance to having a nuke dropped directly on your face.  Alcohol essentially saps bacterial cells of all moisture instantaneously, and to combat that they would need to develop characteristics which would essentially make them not even bacteria anymore (like a plant-like cell wall or a eukaryote-like complex cell membrane)  EDIT:  I got a few things wrong, thanks for pointing them out everyone! (no sarcasm intended).  -  Alcohol doesn’t work mainly by sapping moisture, it actually causes the bacterial cell membrane (and eukaryotic cell membranes also) to basically dissolve.  We can put it on our hands because of our epidermal outer layer of already-dead cells which basically doesn’t give a fuck about alcohol.  - Some bacteria actually can develop resistance to low to moderate concentrations of alcohol, by devoting more resources to a thickened cell membrane.  - Look up bacterial endospores.  These can survive highly concentrated alcohol solutions and cause surfaces to be re-colonized under the right conditions.
It depends on what’s in the hand sanitizer.   The triple antibiotic soaps and hand sanitizers will absolutely cause resistance to develop. This has already been documented and it is discouraged to use those types of soaps and sanitizers.   For alcohol based sanitizers, the mechanism of killing bacteria is much more intense, for lack of a better word. Antibiotic resistance can be through random mutations of the targeted protein or an enzyme that sequesters or degraded the antibiotic; antibiotics act in a very specific way, so resistance is just a change in the very specific mechanism. Alcohol’s effect is far-reaching and affects nearly all aspects of bacteria. It is very unlikely that all the proper mutations will be present to resist the alcohol’s effect. In fact it’s so unlikely that it hasn’t been documented to any reasonable degree that I know of.   The 0.01% is most likely due to bacteria forming spores or improper technique over a tiny portion of the skin.   Please correct me if I’m wrong or have any assumptions I should state.   Edit: felt that further clarification of why spores don’t develop resistance was necessary. You can think of spores as dehydrated cells. They have a thick cell wall that resists most extreme environments, e.g. low nutrients, low and high temperatures, low moisture, radiation, etc. so they won’t react to any stimulus at ergo they won’t acquire resistance since they aren’t really living (so to speak) They are actually a worry when sending space equipment to other planets. How do we know if life found there is native or just a spore that decided to start populating the planet when it fell off the space equipment?
"There are two parts to this question.  First, sanitizer probably will kill all germs; the 99.99% is given to err on the side of caution, to prevent people from suing ""hey, I found 2 still living germs out of the billions I started with, you are making false promises"" (and proving that those 2 germs were due to contaminated sample or the sanitizer was not used properly is difficult).  Second, AFAIK it's impossible to be immune against the alcohols used in sanitizers; there's too much of it so that even a slight immunity would not be enough; all biological processes would probably have to change to be immune.  The same way biological systems cannot develop immunity against fire or strong acids/bases, they cannot develop immunity against sanitizers."
So it’s kinda like this: there’s a difference between antibiotics and sanitizer.  Let’s think about if you wanted to wreck someone’s car: you could do a small targeted attack (cut a brake line, drain the fuel, ruin the steering). For every strategy you choose, they can improve it (locked fuel door, etc). You could also take the less glamorous approach and just completely destroy the car baseball bat at midnight style.   That’s what alcohol does, it’s the crude style, it’ll always work, and you can’t really stop it.
"""99.99%"" is more or less a marketing safety net, as they can't just say 100%. The alcohol in virtually all hands sanitizers will kill any bacteria it comes in contact with, for reasons explained in other comments, but in the case of bacteria lucky enough to be missed when applying the sanitizer, it's just safer to say ""99.99%"".  Similar with the ""99.9%"" chance of preventing pregnancy with condoms. Sometimes pregnancy does occur due to user error or manufacturing defect. "
Let's say you throw 1000 humans into a volcano. One of them happens to land on a ledge inside the volcano and escapes. If he has kids, they will not be volcano resistant.
Is there any theoretically life form that would be alcohol resistant? 
The real reason hand sanitizer says 99.X% percent is they can't make the claim of 100% and be safe from legal liability, even though 100% is largely accurate. Even bleach cleaner can't make the 100% claim for that reason, even though bleach *definitely* kills 100% of things. 
It’ll kill some of the bacteria it comes in contact with, but no it won’t sanitize your mouth unless you intentionally swish it around for an extended period (like Listerine). Even then, it won’t kill all the bacteria in your mouth because there are so many nooks and crannies that will protect whatever bacteria are lodged there.
Interestingly enough, John Snow (not the same) mapped out cases of Cholera in the late 19th Century to find where the outbreaks were occurring to prove that they were water-related.   https://www1.udel.edu/johnmack/frec682/cholera/  > The workers at the brewery one block east of the Broad Street pump could drink all the beer they wanted; the fermentation killed the cholera bacteria, and none of the brewery workers contracted cholera.

Dentist here. Just to clear up the misconception that the alcohol on listerine is the antiseptic. It's used at low ~20% to dissolve the essential oils. Listerine is an essential oil mouthrinse. It's those that give the burning sensation. Just like menthol gives you a cooling sensation. You need a way higher alcohol percent to act as disinfectant, much higher than listerine has. 
Cholera isn't killed by fermentation. Beer is boiled before it's fermented; there were no live cholera left to go into the fermenter.
Same with other spores and some bacteria. This is usually why Isopropyl and Ethyl alcohol based sanitizers are diluted to 70%. Some bacteria can survive in near 100% alcohols but not in 70%.

Alcohol-resistant bacteria are evolving, exactly as you described:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC140401/  It seems a lack of thoroughness in cleaning acupuncture needles leads some bacteria to survive and proliferate between cleanings. These then go on to infect the patient.
The real kicker is how long it took people to link boiling water to preventing illness.  It's a bit of a mind bender to think that Pasteur was amongst the first to actually take it seriously enough to bet big on it, in not just one or two fields but three.
An example of this is C. Diff spores are not killed by hand sanitizer. This is why you have to wash your hands with soap and water when working in a hospital
Formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, Ortho-phthalaldehyde, and peracetic acid.
"Quick Google of FDA sterilants suggests the main sterilants are:  - Peracetic acid  - Glutaraldehyde  - Hypochlorite  - Hydrogen peroxide  - Ortho-Phthaldehyde  These would be liquid sterilant/high level disinfectants that you can apply with gloves.   For the real killer stuff used to sterilise equipment e.g. vaccine/medicines manufacturing, they use gases which can get into every nook and cranny.   The main one is steam sterilisation at elevated pressures, and for temperature sensitive applications, they use ethylene oxide (EtO), vapourised hydrogen peroxide, and EtO/CFC mixes. Naturally these are somewhat hazardous to human health, so the conditions for sterilisation have to be VERY tightly controlled - a level as low as 75ppm of hydrogen peroxide is ""immediately dangerous to life or human health"" for example, and that is one of the least toxic gaseous sterilants.      "
Dental student so different poster, but yes. We are being to recommend the alcohol free ones because the lack of alcohol is better for you in the long run.   The active ingredient in effective mouth rinses is fluoride. 
The ethanol rewuires water to properly attack the cell walls of the bacteria. Think of using soap only versus soap and water. 
Hand sanitizer can't kill everything, so instead, you just use soap and water to get them off. Soap acts as a surfactant, allowing more things to be washed out and carried away from your hands with water.
The soap doesn't actually kill anything.  Most of the bacteria and other organisms that are on your hands are sitting in the nature oil your body will produce on it's skin surface. Most soaps are made up of two layers, one of which attaches to any and all oil on your hands, and one which wants to attach to water. It causes all the oil, dirt, etc on your hands to be suspended within the water, which will wash away when you wash your hands off.
"The main one in the front on my mind right now is that it makes the negative effects of smoking worse by making it easier for all those chemicals to get into your blood system.   Even if you don't smoke, the alcohol isn't selecting what its killing. It will kill pretty much every cell it comes in contact with, including yours. In the short term, its not a lot of damage, and the tissue in the mouth regenerate really fast, but it can make healing from something else slower.   According to this the following study, long term use of mouthwashes containing alcohol increases the risk of getting oral cancer. ""the use of an alcoholic mouthwash twice daily increased the chance of acquiring cancer by over nine times (OR 9.15) for current smokers, over five times for those who also drank alcohol (OR 5.12) and almost five times for those who never drank alcohol (OR 4.96).27""  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00070.x/full  The role of alcohol in oral carcinogenesis with particular reference to alcohol-containing mouthwashes Authors MJ McCullough, CS Farah"
Yes.  [Here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04) is an excellent map showing accurately modeled atmospheric levels of CO2 from satellite and ground measurements taken during a year, for example.  You can easily see humans emitting it, and then forested regions sucking it up.  Unless it’s winter in that hemisphere, in which case it just swirls around until spring.  Other gas levels show similar seasonal patterns.  (Edit: changed to specify that it is a model based on continuous samples.  They obviously can’t sample the entire atmosphere at once every day.  And CO2 isn’t bright red.  Among other points people apparently felt necessary to clarify.)  (Edit again:  wow, I was not really expecting so much karma and a double-gold for this.  The question just reminded me of this cool map I once saw.  I bet it's even a repost!)
No, oxygen levels do not noticeably change. The CO2 video, while interesting, shows changes in levels measures in parts per million - like 10 PPM between summer and winter - so no where near noticeable for human.  As an example, air we inhale has about 21% oxygen and we exhale about 16% oxygen (and 5% CO2). So that change is ~50,000 PPM.  Likewise with air quality - there are differences but nothing humans could detect. And even then human factors (like proximity to vehicle exhaust) outweigh anything natural (except fires).
According to *Measuring Metabolic Rates* by Dr. John RB Lighton, atmospheric levels of oxygen are incredibly stable worldwide at 20.94%. That is all locations, all altitudes and all year.  Of course barometric pressure will play a role due to Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures, but when compensated for you’ll get such a stable reading that you can calibrate a sensor against it.  The only time oxygen is much different is when measuring essentially exhaled breath. But if you get outside a confined space and away from creatures, you’re at 20.94%. 
While there may be a slight difference in air quality, the vast majority of Earth’s O2 supply comes from waterborne algae. So theoretically, all the trees could be cut down and we would still survive. However, trees are pretty and is like them to stay a while.
This was the coolest thing I saw today. Thank you.
What's going on in the southern hemisphere? Low population? Seems strange that there is no mix between the hemispheres.
Doesn’t this completely contradict the top answer?   EDIT Nevermind I can't read. This is about O2, not CO2. Carry on.
Also spring runoff tapers off. Lightly packed snow melts very quickly when the temperature warms up, causing large runoff. Then dense, icier layers melt more slowly throughout the year, giving us more stable stream flows. It's actually a pretty big problem right now: heavy snow falls in the American Rockies have been shifting later in the year, meaning that they have less time to compress into dense layers that melt slowly. This means that a lot of the snow pack melts quickly in the spring, leaving less to full the rivers in mid to late summer. Just these last two weeks the Rockies got their first heavy snow of the season, and winter is almost over.
"it's awfully striking, but look at the scales. The big change in summer to winter in the northern hemisphere looks to me to be a change from a high of 386 ppm to a low of 377 ppm, or a difference of 9 ppm (2.4%).  That's not insignificant, but the imagery looks like ""there's no CO2 here, wait, oh the HUMANITY"" "
Low land area. The ocean emits and absorbs carbon at a more constant rate than land that sometimes has plants growing and sometimes has them frozen.  The northern hemisphere has huge forests (Russia, Canada, the biggest countries in the world) that are frozen and not doing anything for half the year, and then for the other half of the year absorbs huge amounts of carbon.
It's not designed to make you panic about climate change it's an educational video about the distribution of CO2 and CO in the atmosphere during the year. If the difference is between 377ppm and 395ppm then that's what you base your scale on to make it clear.
Totally agree that the scale is very tight for CO2, but there could be something statistically significant about that range. There's also no reason to think that the ppm doesn't fall well below that when an area is devoid of any color for the scale.  The CO level scale is also much more open, and shows the significance of those fires the narrator mentions.  Good spot though.
It has less than one third of the land area and less than one eighth of the population compared to the North.
That plus only 12% of the population lives south of the equator. Plus weather patterns tend to trap the gasses on the side of the equator where they’re generated, so the CO2 generated by the 88% of population in the north during winter can’t get across the equator to the south to spread out and/or be absorbed. Those factors together with what you said definitely do it. 
Exactly. What are they suggesting, that it starts at 0? The boundaries of the scale are chosen because that's the real world change in CO2 levels. If you made it 0-400 the whole map would be red because all the data would be in the last 2% of the scale.
Only 12%?? Wow. That just seems crazy low to me.
This is feeling a bit confrontational for three people saying the same thing. 
If you look at a map you will be surprised to realize that most of the earth's land mass is north of the equator. It's not evenly distributed.
This also really tripped up early explorers, they thought that the earth had to be balanced in terms of land masses between the north and south and so they fantasised this huge landmass in the south and called it Terra Australis. This land would have to be roughly the size of Eurasia. For this reason when people started exploring the last  bits of explorable southern hemisphere they were expecting to quickly run into land, instead they nearly ran out of resources before finding Australia and New Zeeland.   This also caused them to discover New Zeeland when Abel Tasman and his crew were trying to explore the southern parts of Australia, because they thought it would be massive they explored way down south (against struggling with supplies) and completely missing it before hitting new Zeeland. 
"in terms of optics and photoreceptor density, which are the principal factors in a creature's visual resolution (""details per degree of visual angle""), there probably isn't much real difference between the *angular* visual resolution of e.g. a jumping spider and a house cat - both can see, at best, about ~10 details per degree. so if you shrank a cat down to spider size (or vice versa), they'd both have similar limits to the smallest things they could see.  but since they're different sizes, the sizes of the things they can see will also scale; since the eye is getting smaller, its ~~*near point*~~ (i think i meant 'depth of field' here) is getting proportionally shorter. so if a jumping spider's eye is a thousand times smaller than a cat's eye, it can potentially resolve details that are a thousand times smaller than what a cat's can resolve. a cat can never get optically close enough to a grain of sand to make it a degree wide, so that it could see 'ten details' on its surface, while this optical distance is easily available to the spider.  the caveat to this general scalability of vision is in the ""noisiness"" of light, i.e. factors like diffraction (limitation in how small of a point can be focused) or chromatic aberration (the difference in focal distance for different light wavelengths) - for a big eye with a big pupil, this noisiness is insignificant, but for a spider's eye it is getting significant, since all of us are looking at more-or-less the same light bandwidth. jumping spiders, for example, deal with this by having retinas at different focal depths to try to account for chromatic aberration.  but this stuff gets complicated, especially considering that the range in optical quality and photoreceptor density across species washes out most of these limitations. i think you could safely suppose that, in the range of terrestrial creature sizes, vision basically scales with size.  *edit* the important thing is that things scale, but my concepts are confused re ""near point"" etc, see /u/craigdubyah for better/more detailed info---  *edit edit* sorry i didn't keep up with this, was busy all day; but let me excuse the rough edges of my answer by saying it was a lot of well-informed hand waving and of course i didn't try to go into detail about diffraction and lens power and etc etc; i just wanted to get the basic gist across that vision should more-or-less scale with the size of the eye, receptor sampling being equal (as in the cat/spider comparison). field of view, pupil sizes, etc, all very important but another time and place, ok?"
"Leaving out actual biological examples and speaking strictly in terms of the physics of what would happen if you shrunk or grew a human eye, kind of.   If you took a normal human eye and shrunk it down, the iris would shrink with it. This is equivalent to having a camera with a tiny aperture. If you have glasses, try taking them off, making a really tiny hole with your fingers and looking through it - you'll see clearer. This is also why squinting helps you see - you're looking through the tiny holes in your eyelashes. This makes both near *and* far clearer - what photographers call ""increased depth of field"". The tradeoff is brightness - make the hole too small and not enough light gets in.   On the other hand, if you grew an eye, the iris would get larger, eventually it would be a gaping hole and the eye wouldn't be very functional at all. With a quarter sized iris I would guess you could still tell things like the direction of the sun and such, but not much more.   The size of the lense, on the other hand, makes no difference. It's the shape of the lense that determines whether the eye sees near or far, not the size.   Quick visual explanation of pinhole effect: http://i199.photobucket.com/albums/aa90/kimsoonee/home%20video%20audio/pinhole-effect-on-eye.jpg"
This is a great answer, and I think more to the point of what OP was asking. Followup; can you give an ELI5 on chromatic aberration? I'm not sure what focal distance means in that context.
You blew my mind with your comment about jumping spiders having evolved a system for chromatic aberration correction. I searched a bit and found this excellent reading on the vision of jumping spiders: https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sensory_Systems/Spiders Hope you will find it as interesting as I did.
Okay, that's a good run down of reducing the size of the parts of the eye: rod and cone limits, aperture/lens size, diffraction, etc.  But what about the dimensions of the eye itself?  In particular, a smaller eye will have to have a smaller focal length.  This would require a significantly different curvature of the lens.  Is there a limit to a biological lens's curvature?  Would it reduce (or expand) the ability to adjust for near or far focus?
"Squinting also changes the shape of the eye to help one focus, more so than ""seeing through tiny holes in your eyelashes""."
When light passes a transparent medium (water, a prism) it gets bent. The degree of the bending is dependent of color (aka frequency) of the light. That is why you see a rainbow pattern once light leaves a prism and the same applies to rainbows in the air, where the water is the medium responsinble for the bending.  Chromatic aberration is that principle applied to lenses. On photos you might see an object several times slightly offset and in different colours. That is not an error of the sensor or film, but the lens, which can't bring all different colors of an object onto the same pixel.
Small eyes, if we're talking insects and stuff, aren't built like ours.  Some of them are simple light sensors like those in flatworms, others collections of tiny lenses, as you see in insects.  Each of those little hexagons in an insect's eye contains a few light sensing cells, a lens, and optic nerves.  They don't, as often seen in movies, show the insect an array of the same image.  Each one sees a little bit of it's surroundings, and the brain meshes them all together. 
I am very short-sighted and rarely wear my glasses - instead opting for contact lenses - because my lenses are so thick. I've noticed that with my glasses, when I look at objects at the edge of the lens' field of view  that there's a red or blue outline depending on the side I'm looking through. Is that an example of chromatic aberration? 
Ant-Man shrinks through magic. You cannot compress an atom without immediately blowing yourself apart at the atomic level.  If you shrink through magic you can see just fine!
Sure sounds like it.  [Here's a (I expect deliberately) bad photo showing what it looks like.](https://i1.creativecow.net/u/94713/pp011185crb.jpg)  In microscopy, the degree to which the lens (objective) is corrected for this problem (and a few others) makes the difference between a $50 lens and a $5000 lens.
This is a big deal for telescopes with lenses. It wasn't until Isaac Newton came along and invented the reflecting (or Newtonian) telescope that we could see clearly. Even the Hubble is a Newtonian design. (There are more compact modern scopes that use a mixture of reflection and refraction, but they're rare.) There was a top end to what refracting telescopes can see clearly because of chromatic aberration, and we hit it pretty hard.
"Sleeping literally changes our very physiology. Our core body temperature drops which allows certain proteins to work differently than they do during our ""waking temp,"" as a broad example. It's not something we'd want easy control over.   Most importantly the process of getting sleepy is highly regulated by not only our Circadian rhythm but also by other hormone systems.   We need to burn energy to feel fatigued (when we use ATP and make Adenosine as a byproduct, which signals fatigue in humans).   We need a lack of blue-wavelength light to initiate the process of releasing melatonin at night, which makes us sleepy and helps initiate the sleeping-end of our Circadian processes.   We don't have voluntary control over sleep because it's chemically regulated. Adenosine, melatonin, hypercretin (Orexin), etc..   It's not something we can flex like a muscle. It's essentially hormonal in nature and therefore requires us to use drugs (meaning ligands that bind to targets in our body) to control it.   "
My understanding is that there is an evolutionary benefit to sleep being a passive (rather than an active) drive. You need to sleep, and, if deprived, you *will* sleep (just like you *will* urinate, eventually). That said, finding the appropriate conditions for sleep can be difficult. There is [evidence of sleep patterns being conserved regardless of brain/body ratio](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313009045), which suggests that passive sleep entry is also conserved. There are cyclical hormonal changes (melatonin and cortisol being the main factors), which are involved in induction of sleep, so parts of the impetus to sleep are physiological, and induction is extrinsic. Under stressful circumstances, those extrinsic factors can also prevent sleep (like a mountain lion or worrying).
"There's no 'why' to how humans exist. It's more about what evolutionary advantage it would be to being able to directly control your sleep system.  What would happen if you could manually control your heart rate? Any human that could do that would quickly accidentally kill themselves. And any human that could manually & immediately control their sleep would do it wrong a lot and at inopportune times.  We can control our bladders - but it takes time and learning how to do it. Also what happens when we get terrified? Releasing our bladders spontaneously happens in inopportune times - but in that situation, it's not deadly. immediate sleep is deadly.  We can manually control our breathing (and now you are) to a certain extent. But that's because swimming would be beneficial to our ancestors in certain instances. And even with that, we can 'breathe wrong' in certain situations.  But for sleep, we DO have some control over it - similar to breathing. If you relax, get to a comfortable spot, in an area that isn't inducing anxiety or fear, close your eyes, and let your mind drift then you can ""allow"" yourself to sleep. This system gets you the ability to control your sleep, but indirectly and only when certain conditions are met.  That's much less dangerous and more advantageous than the direct control method."
What is happening late at night, when you can barely keep your eyes open and keep nodding off on the sofa. So you go to bed and are suddenly not tired and it takes about an hour to get to sleep?
So in that, are there not elements we can control (basically the foundation of good sleep hygiene)?  Turning off screens and favouring 'redder' light tones, exercising daily, doing relaxing activities that 'cool' you down (lower blood pressure, heart rate, core temp) closer to bedtime, cutting off drinking and eating for a sufficient time before bed, are all things I've heard and used to help create a bedtime routine.  I am aware that no matter how many of these things you do, they won't help you fall asleep 5 hours after you've woken up from a full rest, or at the wrong time of day, but within the ground of your Circadian rhythm there is a little room to play, no?
To me, this is just stating the reasons why it doesn't happen. Is there a reason that things are this way? Is it better for them to be like this, rather than it being like flexing a muscle?
"I'm not sure I understand how sleep being a ""passive drive"" precludes the ability for sleep to be voluntary.  My body requires a certain concentration of of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, and I will breathe involuntarily to maintain those concentrations.  However, I can still voluntarily control my breathing, which suggests that at some point in the past it was beneficial for some ancestor of ours to be able to voluntarily control its breathing.  Perhaps related to diving, but changes to our respiration when diving are also largely involuntary (diving reflex).  I can certainly imagine situations when voluntary sleep would be most beneficial for an animal (though I concede that that's not the same thing as evolutionary pressure, which is what's really required for a trait to emerge)."
> just like you will urinate  Can't I force myself not to?  Leaving aside the very dangerous result of not peeing, am I really unable to 'hold it in' forever?
Sleep hormones are high, minimal movement, your body is starting the sleep process on the couch. Then you decide to get up, and a big red button is pressed that fires some cortisol for alertness and slows/stops the process. You’re waking yourself up, and thus the process restarts. 
You're right. It's the same way you can't directly turn off depression, but exercise, sleep, and similar absolutely can influence depression level. Not a switch, but not NO control. Just more indirect. 
"Exactly, this is a ""how"" answer, not a ""why"" answer. In biology, any ""why"" answer ultimately has to be evolutionary (even if the evolutionary answer relies on other constraints, e.g. there's no way to evolve a voluntary chemical mechanism like this for some reason)"
Most of the time they are just laying there relaxing, if they aren’t bothered they will fall asleep like that.  Also cats specifically sleep more than humans.
If you, voluntarily, hold your breath for a sufficient period, your body will decide you are no longer in control. (go ahead and try, although I can't recommend it)  Passive drives are bodily functions which we can influence, but can't completely control. You can influence your fear response, but jump scares still work at a physiological level. You can influence your need to eat, but your body will drive you to become ravenous. You can influence your need to poop, but at some point your intestines are full, good luck!
The point is: if you can voluntarily turn off your breath when convenient – subject to the constraint that it'll switch back on automatically after a point – why can't also you voluntarily turn off your awakeness when convenient, subject to the constraint that it'll switch back on automatically after a point? 
To answer your question, probably because it has never been evolutionarily necessary. OTOH, there are some associated indicators, such as that fall-jerk-awake phenomenon; I've seen discussion that might be associated with an evolutionary past in trees or something. 
Yes.  If something causes you to physically not be capable of urinating, your bladder will eventually burst.  Edit: Spontaneous bladder rupture is rare and more of a worst case scenario for not treating the problem.  Though yes eventually it will burst.   Its more likely that your kidneys will be ruined before that happens
Probably not.  In case of bladder obstruction, most often the increased pressure will cause the urine to start backing up into the ureters.  Then the kidneys will start to fail.  If the blockage is relieved in time the kidneys likely will recover.  Bladder rupture, on the other hand, might happen with trauma and / or a mechanical abnormality like a prior surgery.
The short answer is:  A. They get water from their food, and avoid salty food  B. They may have modification to their kidneys to allow them to excrete more salt  C. There a lot we don't know, marine animals are hard to study    [Source and more details](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-can-sea-mammals-drink/)
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-can-sea-mammals-drink/  It's actually not established that sea mammals drink large amounts of salt water. So they get it from consuming food and peeing out far larger amounts of salt in their urine than humans do.  A theory is that their longer henle's loop allows better processing of salt water via their kidneys as well.   Excellent question.
How do fish maintain low salt content ratio?
Adding to this, if you watch Blue Planet II you'll see David Attenborough explain how turtles cry a very thick salty sludge as a removal process.  And as this is Reddit, and before anyone asks, no humans CANNOT drink saltwater and hope to (how shall I put this politely) *emit salty fluids* as a method of removal.
But how the fish drink?
When you say they avoid salty food what does that mean?  Are there food sources with higher than average salt content within the cells?  Are there foods that cultivate salt on their outsides for some reason?
1.) Saltwater fish have very concentrated urine so as to retain as much water as possible 2.) Bony fish have special cells in their gills which will pump chloride ions up their concentration gradient and out of the body 3.) Elasmobranchs (Sharks/Rays) maintain high levels of salt in their body in the form of TMAO and Urea, this keeps them isotonic with the surrounding water 4.) Some sharks (e.g. Squalus sp.) have special glands in their rectum which will secrete salts  There are probably other strategies as well
The fish drink sea water, but they filter it very well. Also notice that the original question is about sea mammals. Mammals and fish are different in many fundamental ways, although they both live in water.
Another user in the thread mentioned that most sea-faring mammals are completely or mostly carnivorous because water plants tend to have a salinity very near that of the water they grow in. So basically mammals let other animals do most of the filtering for them.
Yes, and they have a comparatively longer loop of henle's, a structure in the kidneys, to help them excrete more salt. Later in life cats also often end up with kidney issues as well.
That's definitely not of the main reasons. Water is the solvent in which every biochemical reaction takes place. Anything else is secondary.
>Saltwater fish have very concentrated urine so as to retain as much water as possible  That means they have powerful kidneys, right?
How do land mammals like cats filter out salt water? I’ve read their kidneys are strong enough to do it. Also, why has this trait not evolved in other mammals? It seems like it would be an evolutionary advantage to have a limitless water supply near the coasts. 
They actively pump the salts out of their bodies. Interestingly, this is the exact opposite of what river fish do.  Basically, diffusion will always cause materials to move from an area of high concentration into one of lower concentration. If you fart in the corner of a room, it's only a matter of time before someone standing in the opposite corner smells it.  So, river fish have a body salinity that is higher than the surrounding water. If they didn't actively pump salts into their bodies at the expense of energy, they would lose those vital salts. Resisting a diffusion gradient requires an expenditure of energy. (Such as wafting the fart back in the direction of it's source, or using fans to keep it from spreading.)  Seawater fish tend to have body salinity far lower than that of the surrounding water, so they have to do the opposite - pumping salt OUT of their bodies.  With fish, they absorb water through their gills through osmosis, IIRC.
Not compared to mammals. They actually produce very little urine and the ions are being pushed down their concentration gradient (mostly) in the kidneys, not up. Take a look at this: http://web.utk.edu/~rstrange/wfs550/html-con-pages/u-osmo-kid.html
"*Powerful* is the wrong word, simply because the kidneys of saltwater fishes play *sort of* an opposite role.   To explain this I'll first compare freshwater and saltwater fishes:  Saltwater fishes must actively drink water due to osmosis. The concentration of solutes (I'll just say salt) is much higher in the surrounding water than it is in their blood/tissues. Water flows from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. The concentration of *water* molecules in the cells is *higher* than the concentration in the surrounding seawater. This means the water is going to flow out of their cells, not in.  So the kidneys of saltwater fishes need to *retain water* and *excrete salt*.   Freshwater fishes have the opposite problem. They do not ""drink"" because water is constantly flowing into their cells. They need to *retain salt* and *excrete water*.   This gets a little muddied when comparing mammals to saltwater *or* freshwater fishes because our kidneys need to retain salt *and* water.   So anyway, I'm just pointing out these complications. I'm mostly a fish person."
I like your question and I hope to see a proper response to it.  Regarding the coast issue, there was an ask science thread that asked why it was advantageous for humans to become so reliant on freshwater. The main response I saw was that freshwater sources are actually more plentiful than saltwater, because the area of inland habitable areas feed by streams and lakes is much larger than the thin strip of saltwater coast that is lost by such an evolution.
Not what I expected to be reading at 0930 on a Wednesday, but thanks!
So... is there a way we could harness this in desalination? 
How much solute/water they can pump against its concentration gradient per unit time. Generally this can be expressed as the molality of the solute and the urine flow. The higher the molality, generally the more powerful the kidneys.
"That's exactly what we do to desal. Look up ""reverse osmosis"". It doesn't use a fish kidney, but it is a synthetic semi-permeable membrane that operates on the exact same principal.  It's not a solution to a drought problem because it's too expensive. You need high pressure high volume pumps and those RO filters don't last long when you hit them with seawater.   It's cheaper to build a thousand miles of canals and pumping stations to move that much water from the rainy part to the desert part. See ""California Aqueduct""."
Nearsightedness needs to be corrected precisely so that objects at infinity are in focus. Each eye may need a different correction and there may be astigmatism as well. Farsightedness just needs to be corrected for a comfortable reading distance.  A limited analogy is that it is like buying and using magnifying glass vs  a camera or projector lens.  Edit: An optometrist's explanation is here   https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d26nwr/why_do_nearsighted_people_need_a_prescription_and/ezt656x/
Because the dollar store readers are not made to correct hyperopia (“farsightedness”); they are made to correct presbyopia (the loss of focusing flexibility that hits all of us in our early 40s). Presbyopia occurs in all of us in a relatively equal way, so making a standardized power for presbyopia is easy.  Basically, the cheater readers are making the assumption that the wearer has perfect distance vision, and simply brings the focal point forward to a comfortable reading distance.  Now, plus power lenses that correct for presbyopia also happen to help with hyperopia. However, unless your hyperopia just coincidentally happens to be equal between your eyes, free of astigmatism, and of a small enough amount, the readers are only partially correcting it. It may be better than nothing, or even good enough for practical use in many cases, but they do not usually fully or adequately correct the hyperope’s vision.  As far as myopia (“nearsightedness”) goes, its generally too unique to the individual to standardize in a “drug store reader” kind of way. Plus if people are self-diagnosing/correcting myopia, they almost always tend to overcorrect it, making them prone to eyestrain, headaches, and if they are young enough, a worsening of their prescription. In fact a huge part of the refraction procedure (“one or two?”) is making sure the patient hasn’t overcorrected themselves.  Source: I’m an optometrist
One thing that is being overlooked is that monopolization of prescription eyeglass companies as well.  This also drives up the cost.  For reading glasses while reading a book, if you cannot see clearly, you can simply move the book closer or farther away.  This is not possible with a street sign.  So, reading glasses can be standardized.  It is also a different kind of deficiency.
> Nearsightedness needs to be corrected precisely so that objects at infinity are in focus. Each eye may need a different correction and there may be astigmatism as well. Farsightedness just needs to be corrected for a comfortable reading distance.  This is compounded by nearsighted people commonly wearing their glasses basically any time they're not in bed, farsighted will do so specifically when reading things.  So not only  do nearsighted lenses need more precision, they'll often have more security and comfort features e.g. high-index material, anti-glare coating, photochromic treatment, ...
As someone who works in optical I would just like to point out that not all farsighted people wear reading glasses. You can be farsighted and still need a full time correction for distance vision, and this is in fact the most common correction for someone with hyperopia.   People who can purchase off the shelf reading glasses tend to have Presbyopia not Myopia (near-sighted) or Hyperopia (far-sightedness). As off the shelf readers (and reading glasses in general) have focal points of about 14 inches. Which means that they are 100% useless for wearing for day to day tasks.   The majority of people with Hyperopia must wear their glasses 100% of the time so also have a focal distance of infinity.   /u/simrc86  EDIT: forgot to mention I’m an Optician.
You can overcorrect nearsightedness, making the person effectively a bit far-sighted. Then you don't need to control it that well either.  Astigmatism can occur both with near- and far-sightedness.
"The ""one or two"" thing... Should it end with something that gives you perfect focus? Or is the Dr looking for something else when they do this?"
Exactly Luxottica bought up all their competitors including Oakley and Ray Ban.
Usually the goal is “about the same,” but honestly it depends on where you are in the process or if the doc is double checking some stuff.
We use moles instead of mass since it accurately shows how many molecules of a substance we have. The chemistry behind reactions is dependent on the number of molecules present, not their mass.  To put more simply, it's more important to know many ingredients you have for making a hamburger, then it is to know how much the ingredients weigh. It's more important to have two buns instead of just knowing you have 100g of buns.  Edit: Forgot to mention that the OPs question is not stupid, and is completely reasonable. As some others pointed it, it would be a good opportunity for the teacher to emphasize the importance of moles vs mass.
Wow that's a really bad thing for a teacher to say.  edit: thought this was AskScienceDiscussion, I have violated a central rule of my own subreddit.
You did not ask a stupid question. When trying to understand these conventions of science, you pretty much can't ask a stupid question. In fact, I would argue it was an **important** question, and the teacher wasted an opportunity to stress the usage of the mole to the class.   The mole refers to a number of things, just like a dozen. You can have a dozen eggs, but also you could have a dozen molecules of caffeine. You could have a mole of caffeine, but you also could have a mole of eggs. This is important because chemistry cares more about the *number* of molecules than the weight of those molecules.   Furthermore, consider the following balanced equation: 2(H2) + (O2) -> 2(H2O). Given 2 moles of H2 and excess oxygen, you know you can produce 2 moles of H2O. Using moles allows us to compare the actual quantity of molecules, whereas with weight it would be difficult to compare in such a neat fashion. Given 200g of H2 and excess oxygen, you have to do some annoying math to first convert to moles, then convert back to grams.   Mass is, like you noted, more useful because it's easier to measure. You weigh chemicals with mass because it's easier, and because we're capable of converting to moles. That said, it's not uncommon to have percentages which are based on weight. Mass by mass, mass by volume, and volume by volume (m/m, m/v, and v/v respectively) are all common, with the first being solids in solids (e.g. alloys), the second being solids in liquids (e.g. solutions), and the third being liquids in liquids (mixtures and some solutions). 
"Your teacher is a dick. It's a great question to ask.  Moles allows you to do calculations with the actual number of molecules.  There's a reason why people don't go around saying ""I need 200 kg worth of guys to help me out here!"" It wouldn't be very practical to use mass in that situation. However, saying ""I need three guys here!"" makes total sense."
Not stupid at all. This is a concept which should be drilled a billion times in high school. Its not that obvious a thing to know moles make sense over mass. Teacher should be happy a student wants to understand the concept.   But like others explained, in chemistry, it's more important to know the amount of molecules you have in hand rather than the mass. Hence the need to use moles. 
As a teacher, I'm really sorry that one of yours would say something like that to you, or any student. It sounds like he truly doesn't understand the amazing opportunity he's been given by getting to spend time with you all every day--and he doesn't deserve it. Yes, there are a lot of things about the profession to be frustrated with, but a student taking the initiative to ask a thoughtful question, is far from one of them.
In chemistry you care about the number of units that react. Not about their weight.   It doesn't matter that 2 pounds of apples react with 4 pounds of oranges. You are interested in knowing how many apples react with one orange, or vice versa. And then maybe calculate the mass of apples and oranges that reacted/you'd need to have beforehand.  No question is a stupid question. Maybe you don't know the answer to a very obvious question, but that's part of the learning process.   Don't feel ashamed for your question. You did the right thing, you didn't know, and you asked who you thought would give you the right answer.    --- --- --- × --- --- ---  Edit: Answering to the reply of this comment:    The number of molecules is directly related to the substance mass, but it is molecule/atom/substance dependent.  The number of molecules in 3 grams of apples and 3 grams of oranges aren't the same. Think of it as dozens of regular chicken eggs vs ostrich eggs. Yes, the number of units in a dozen is equivalent, but the masses aren't!   If you asked someone for one pound of regular eggs and one pound of ostrich eggs, you wouldn't receive the  same number of regular & ostrich eggs. You'd get many less ostrich eggs than regular ones. Same with chemical compounds and elements. They don't weight the same. So you want to define a standard amount of units, the mole, to express effortlessly a standardized number of units, instead of using masses!   In chemistry you are always interested in the number of  elements (element, as in, a single element in a bunch, not as in a chemical element) reacting/interacting, not their mass. Mass is a particular characteristic of the reagent/element/compound/molecule, whereas number of units is constant. 3 moles of water have the same number of particles as 3 moles of aspirin, 3 moles of cocaine and 3 moles of CO2!
Best laymans explanation i ever heard for it. Expanding on this analogy having 700gs of buns doesnt really tell you anything usefull but knowing that 700 grams is 7 full buns you now know you have enough buns for 7 burgers so when you wanna make as many burgers as you can you know you can make 7 max.   In chemistry terms if i have 500 mL of an alcohol i want to turn into an ester i dont know how much carboxylic acid i need because volumes, like grams, dont tell you how much you actually have so i need so work out the moles and lets say its 3 moles. The reactions 1:1 so i know i need 3 moles of carboxylic acid.   For those wondering about the reaction its alcohol + carboxylic acid - > ester + H2O
"Yea, instead of confessing ""I don't know"" he attacked the best feature of a pupil, a curiosity. It's just opposite of what teacher supposed to do."
Ego is such a fustrating thing sometimes. He could have said it was an interesting question and helped him find the answer. Then they both could have learned something.  I'm just glad kids have more resources now to get answers. 
Why don't we use particle number instead of moles? I don't understand the purpose of moles.
I don’t think this is a great answer in terms of how the question was framed.   You’re not giving reasons why OP’s logic is invalid in a way they can understand. I think OP understood about molecular mass. He just thinks it’s easy to convert since in many classroom HS settings you often start with a weight to begin with.   Think of helium.   How in a standard environment would you weigh that?  That’s the type of answer OP wants.   It could be done in a vacuum but I think people are skipping right past the why because to them that point is glossed right over in their day to day work.   **The mole is used because it represents a measurement that is least likely to be affected by outside factors.**  I feel like these answers are going to be filled with a bunch of college students saying similar things. “We do things this way because these are best practices and we start with premeasured quantities.”  When really OP is looking for the why and practical examples to better explain the situation. 
I never really understood why we did it that way it was just one of those things that we do 'because we do' so thanks for clearing that up for me, actually understand it now even though it's useless for me now it's still nice to know haha. 
If he didn't know it would be even worse. This would be extremely basic for a chemistry teacher.
Sad thing is, that's a pretty general piece of information the teacher should already know
The numbers would be very big and therefore awkward for any amount of matter that is physically observable by humans
Mole is a quantity. Just like a dozen eggs is 12 eggs, a mole of eggs is 6.02214076×10^23 eggs.  This is a huge number, but it is used to measure tiny things, like atoms and molecules. So one mole of hydrogen atoms is only about 1 g in weight.
And it make more sense when talking about how many elections transferred or chemical bounds formed. Since weight is for real things, we need something for abstract aspect of the chemistry.
"So is a dozen.  And yet we say ""I got six dozen eggs"" rather than ""I got 72 eggs"".  Some things are just talked about in certain ways."
"Well, it actually is a unit. You might be confusing Avogadro's number with the concept of a mole. You can convert grams to moles by using the molar mass, and moles to #molecules/#particles by using Avogradro's number. And Avogradro's number was specifically created to make finding the molar mass ridiculously simple (just look at the atomic mass). So, moles are a unit we created to make calculations simplier, and as fonduman said, created so you aren't stuck looking at 52*10^26 molecules and instead looking at about 100 moles.  Hope this helped.  Edit: Okay, so after further thought, and seeing mispells1wordallways's answer above, I think the mole is more of a ""psudo unit"". It only makes sense when you specify WHAT you have a mole of (iron atoms, water molecules, actual moles, etc.)"
No, I don't think any telescope could come close.  For instance, Hubble has an angular resolution of about 1/10 of an arcsecond. It is approximately 384,000km from the moon. 1/10 arcsecond is 1/36000 of a degree, and a circle is 360 degrees.   1/10 arcsecond on a circle with radius 384000 km is:  2 * 384000 * pi / 360 / 36000 = 0.18617  So the resolution of Hubble would be 186m, much too large to make out a single human. To achieve the sub-1m resolution needed to discern a person on the moon, a telescope would need a resolution over 100 times better, which does not exist.
"I'm an astrophysicist, and I believe the answer is: ~~yes~~ maybe.  First we need to calculate the angular size of a \~2 meter astronaut on the moon. We can do this easily on [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%282+meters%29+%2F+%28distance+to+the+moon%29%29+radians+to+milliarcseconds): we find that the astronaut is about 1.04 milliarcseconds.  As other users have pointed out, no single telescope is large enough to have this kind of angular resolution. Hubble is about a 100x too small. Typically, to resolve an object, you need the resolution to be at most half of the object's size. So you'd need a resolution of < 0.5 milliarcseconds.  But you don't need a telescope 100x bigger than Hubble to have 100x Hubble's resolution. An interferometer is an array of telescopes that have the light-gathering power of their total mirror areas, but the effective angular resolution is determined by their most-separated elements.  The most powerful optical interferometer in the world is the [CHARA array](http://www.chara.gsu.edu/public/instrumentation/31-the-chara-array), located on Mt. Wilson. It's a series of six, 1-meter telescopes that are about 330 meters apart (at longest separation). This means it has the resolution of a 330 meter telescope! CHARA has an angular resolution of 0.2 milliarcseconds, which should be plenty to detect our astronauts.  UPDATE (7 hours later): Someone asked a question that led me to think of an obvious concern: while the astronaut be bright enough to be visible by a small telescope array like CHARA?  The moon reflects [\~12% of the light](https://www.universetoday.com/19981/moon-albedo/) that hits it. Let's assume an astronaut is wearing a classic white spacesuit. That reflects [\~80% of the light](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/29901/why-were-eva-suits-never-silver) that hits it. Let's say then, that for equal angular sizes, astronauts are 6x brighter than the moon's surface. The moon has a surface brightness of [\~4](https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~phiscock/astronomy/light-pollution/moon-brightness.pdf) [mag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude)/arcsecond^(2). If an astronaut has an angular size of \~1 mas, then let's say they have a solid angle of \~1 mas^(2). Then they are [6 x 1 mas^(2) / 1 arcsecond^(2) = 6E-6](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=6+*+%281+square+milliarcsecond+%2F+1+square+arcsecond%29+) times fainter than a square arcsecond of the moon. Which means their apparent magnitude is \~[13](https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/sspickle/Difference+in+magnitudes+from+Flux+Ratio)\+4 = 17.  What sort of exposure time is needed to see a 17th mag object? Well, on the [Kitt Peak National Observatory 0.9 m telescope](https://www.noao.edu/gateway/ccdtime/), it looks like to get a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, we need a an exposure time of 0.7 seconds. But CHARA has 6 telescopes that are a bit bigger at 1.0 meters, so lets call this (0.7/6) \* (1.0/0.9)\^2 = \~0.1 seconds. But I'm going to assume that optical interferometry is more lossy than a simple imager, like in the KPNO example. So let's just arbitrarily bump this up to 0.2 seconds.  I'm not certain what sort of exposure time is necessary for a ground-based telescope like CHARA to work well is. But their [user's manual has an example](http://chara.gsu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=chara:pavo_user_manual&s[]=exposure) where they use an exposure time of 8 ms. Now, is this fast exposure time needed in order to be smaller than the timescale of atmospheric variations? If so, then it's hopeless for our astronaut project.  But, if it's instead the case that CHARA had a rapid exposure time in this example because their target is very bright, then we may still be in business. CHARA might be observing bright targets because they are **big** (because they are close, which is also why they are bright), rather than because they can only see bright things. In this case, CHARA could afford to take slightly longer exposure times of \~0.2 seconds for our astronaut, even if that's a bit slower than the atmospheric coherence timescale (which is usually taken to be 0.01 to 0.1 seconds or so, depending on lots of stuff).  So, because I don't know CHARA's upper limit for exposure time (if there is one), I must offer an unsatisfying conclusion of ""Maybe.""  EDIT: had the wrong link for CHARA initially. Fixed now."
The short answer is no, [there is no telescope on Earth that can resolve detail that small](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/45-our-solar-system/the-moon/the-moon-landings/122-are-there-telescopes-that-can-see-the-flag-and-lunar-rover-on-the-moon-beginner).  In order to resolve something the size of the lunar rover, you would need a telescope that us roughly 75 meters in diameter.  The Hubble telescope is not large enough either, so it would not be able to resolve it.  The [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/) might be able to resolve just enough detail to see some evidence of us being there, but it still isn't powerful enough to resolve people walking around.
>So the resolution of Hubble would be 186m  per pixel.  In case someone thinks that's the width covered by the image.
So... 100 times more powerful than Hubble?  Wasn't Hubble a gift to NASA from the NRO or at least based on a design that was technically, for it's time, a previous gen keyhole satellite?  I remember from somewhere [that Hubble is almost 1:1 a KH-11 keyhole satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-11_Kennen) that is pointed at the stars rather than Earth.  In addition to this, aren't the replacements for Hubble supposed to be built around handy down keyhole sats given to NASA by the NRO.  It's impossible to get information on the current gen of keyhole sats, or even that they exist other than rumors, but 100 times more powerful than 1970s technology doesn't seem that extreme.  From seeing a few of the imaging sensors developed for current/next gen NRO assets and with all the optical lens breakthroughs over the past decade and a half that get announced then acquired for exclusive use for US defense... it doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility that the tech exists but just isn't available for use outside the intelligence community.  ^(edit: added link)
Not any traditional telescope we currently have, but an interferometer could do it. The most powerful optical interferometer on Earth is the [CHARA Array](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHARA_array?wprov=sfla1) in California, with an angular resolution of 200 microarcseconds. At the distance to the Moon, that translates to a resolution of 1.22 feet.  Tl;dr: Yes, we can do it, but there's only one facility on Earth with the capability. The cool thing is that anyone can apply for time on this telescope, so you could go on their website and actually ask them to do this experiment.
Why can't we do what op said?
SO not a single telescope, but 6 smaller telescopes working together? Similar to how the Bouman black hole picture was made?
GREAT caveat. Thank you.
So, if I built a 186m x 186m building on the moon, Hubble could look at it and go neat!
"Due to the wave nature of light, there is an absolute lower limit on the angular resolution of imaging optics that is imposed by the aperture of the instrument, not the ""pixels"" in the detector. It's an issue caused by diffraction patterns in the image that obscure the source information. For a circular aperture, the formula is  Θ = 1.22 x λ/D  Where Θ is the angular resolution of the instrument, λ is the wavelength of light that you are focusing, and D is the diameter of the aperture.  This means that there is a lower limit on the angular distance between two points of light that can be resolved (distinguished) by an instrument. This is called the resolving power of the instrument, and it has nothing to do with the detector (pixels) that record the image. It's all dependant on the wavelength of incident light and the diameter of the aperture.  As an example, you are unable to notice with the naked eye that the north star is, in fact, two stars because the diameter of your pupil is too small to resolve the double. You can easily resolve them with a pair of binoculars, though. It happens that Polaris is a triple, a fact not discovered until 1929 by analyzing the spectrum of light from the system.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution) is the skinny on optical resolution."
The issue is that the moon is still relatively far away compared to the earth. Spy satellites that can get sub-meter resolution imagery are usually in an orbit that is only a few hundred miles above the earth, while the moon is several hundred thousand miles away. If we put one in orbit of the moon we could absolutely see astronauts walking around, but that's not really what the question is about.
> It's impossible to get information on the current gen of keyhole sats, or even that they exist other than rumors, but 100 times more powerful than 1970s technology doesn't seem that extreme.  When /u/yerich is talking about 100 times more powerful, that means 100 times bigger.    100 times larger is hard enough to achieve on the ground:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_optical_reflecting_telescopes  As you can see from the list, we're nowhere close to that yet.  Launching something as large as the big ground telescopes into space is well beyond current capabilities.  You'd be better off putting a better optical telescope in the orbit of the moon.
There is a hard limit to how small of an object a telescope can see. This limit is based on the diameter of the mirror you use and the wavelength of light you are trying to collect.  If an astronaut is standing on the surface of the moon, the *very* small angular resolution needed to pick them up with a telescope on Earth or in Earth orbit would require the telescope to have a ridiculously large mirror, one impossible to build or set up.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution
The resolving power of a telescope is connected by the wavelength of light and the size of the aperture (mirror, lens) of the telescope. At optical wavelengths, to get a 0.1m (enough to see a person is there) resolution at 300,000,000m (distance to the moon) you need an angular resolution of 0.1/300,000,000 radians.  Optical light has a wavelength around 500nm, or 0.000005m.  The [Rayleigh Criterion](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/R/Rayleigh+Criterion) gives a telescope diameter of about 2km. That would let you see objects that looked like blobs about the size of an astronaut.  The largest telescopes on the planet have an aperture of about 10m. We'd like to build one at 30m, but it's hard to find a place to put it.  100m telescopes are within engineering feasibility.  2km telescopes are right out.  So, no.
Atmosphere: good for breathing, less good for high resolution images of objects on the moon (or anywhere else in space). That’s why NASA launches big, expensive space telescopes like Hubble.
it also can't be done in real time.  it takes considerable computing time to combine all the different telescope's data together to get anything close to an image.
if you built a 186m x 186m building on the moon, it will be a single pixel in the image.
That would be much easier and cheaper than having a gigantic telescope in earth orbit just for this purpose though.
Resolution is how close two things have to be in order for you to no longer be able to tell that there are two objects there.  In the case of a telescope, you point the telescope at some angle. How precisely can you determine the angle of an object you're looking at?  If you see two objects 1 degree apart, can you tell that you have two objects, or will it look like one combined object? What about 0.1 degrees? Or 0.01 degrees? The minimum is your angular resolution.
To be fair it could span up to four pixels - it’s gonna be a tiny little smudge either way.
Yes but not as useful. As far as we know there isn't anything happening on the surface of the moon to warrant launch a satellite to orbit. If we return I think taking some drones would be more useful, especially with the low gravity you could have drones quite a bit heavier than the ones on earth flying around taking video.
I believe they mean diameter. There's a fundamental max resolution that is a function of the diameter of a your light collecting area.  This is called [Dawes' Limit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes%27_limit).
Flying drones on the moon. I see nothing wrong with that idea. Nothing at all.
>taking some drones  What would those drones use as propulsion?
I'd put my bet on something like RCS rockets - compressed gas rockets, but don't see how that would last particularly long with a large / heavy payload.  That's the problem with a flying drone on the moon... nothing to *fly in.*
"Hi, medic here! It depends. For the sake of the conversation, I'm going to assume you mean something like a run-of-the-mill, basic cut. You nicked yourself shaving, or your knife slipped a little when you were cutting veggies. Nothing that would require sutures.   Typically, its best to wash the cut with antibacterial soap (like Dial) and warm water, that probably constitutes ""wiping it away"", but only to get any dirt/nasties out of the cut. You do this because when you DO hold pressure to stop the bleeding, you don't want to keep the trapped nasties in there. So technically, it's better to take a little of column a, a little of column b. After your cut has been wiped clean, put steady pressure on it until it clots, then put a layer of protectant (neosporin or the like) and a bandage/bandaid/gauze over it to help it heal.   Now, if you're talking about a trauma situation, it's a little different. Say, for example, you're first responding to a motorcycle accident and this dude's calf is just wrecked to hell, blood everywhere, gravel everywhere inside the laceration- your best bet isn't to keep wiping the gash continuously, you need to apply direct pressure first and foremost to stop the bleeding. Wiping it will do nothing and not allow the blood to clot properly. Pop a tourniquet on too. (This includes keeping the nasties and gravel and all, unfortunately, the hospital will properly clean and suture when they arrive. Motorcycle dude has bigger issues than a little dirt and gravel right now.) You don't want to be exsanguinated just because you kept wiping blood. Wiping continuously doesn't really promote clotting factors, nor allows platelets to form to stop the blood. It's why you are always taught ""direct pressure"" any time there is blood leaking from a wound that shouldn't be there.   TL;DR: when in doubt, keep pressure on it.   I hope this makes sense and answers your question, I'm on maternity leave, pregnant AF, insomnia and heartburn have kept me up for over a day. (:   Edit: holy shit RIP inbox, I wake up because my son decided to falcon punch my bladder after I could finally go to sleep (weird sensation from the inside out) and I have 100+ comments, replies, and messages. Obligatory thank you for the gold! Now, a few clarity points:  For my first basic scenario, I used a common example of what might happen at home/what people have at home to use. Water and really any kind of soap is fine, Dial soap is just what I've been taught to use if I have it, and many of my colleagues do too. (I HATE it though, but I'm also allergic to a lot of other cleansing agents and have to stick with it.) Personally, I don't think water temperature is a difference/makes a difference in the basic cut situation. I cut myself in the shower shaving the other day (big 'ol 32w pregnant belly over here) and I just let it run in the shower, cleaned with soap, but it didn't clot until after I got out and put pressure. EVERY PERSON'S CLOTTING FACTOR IS DIFFERENT, your mileage may vary from others. It takes me 20 minutes to stop a simple little cut like that, whereas my husband just washes and slaps a bandaid on it and forgets about it in three minutes.   On using alcohol/sticking your finger in your mouth- as long as it's rubbing alcohol or peroxide, I don't see why you couldn't dab a bit on. We carry it in the ambulance in situations like this. (Since we don't exactly have a sink with soap and water.) If the drinking alcohol (high proof) you want to use is fresh/unopened, or ensure that nobody has drank from the bottle directly. I've never used drinking alcohol as a sanitizer, so I couldn't tell you. As for sticking your finger or cut in your mouth- I'm completely guilty of doing this too, but just keep in mind that human mouths are NASTY AF! We treat human bites wayyyy more aggressively than dog or animal bites (save for snakes, because venom). Human mouths are just... filthy. I learned how gross our mouths are and made a conscious effort to stop sticking my cut up hands/arms in my mouth. Google some human bites, and look at when they get infected. They aren't pleasant. After seeing some in the field and looking at the infections they harbor, I wouldn't ever consciously do it again- but I mean, you do you. Like I said, I'm guilty of it too, and I think it's a bit of a reflex if I'm honest. (So many people do it!) I'm too tired to do any link adding, so if someone wants to add it, I'll put it here. (:  ON TOURNIQUETS:  A little background for those that don't know me: before I got off the truck due to my little parasite I have affectionately decided to raise, I work in a huge metropolitan area with a combo critical care/911 system. I'm mainly on the CCT (critical care transport) side, meaning we transferred people from hospital to hospital, higher level of care, etc. Got to see some gnarly stuff. We also backflowed our 911 areas when they got busy, so I've seen some crap there too.   Tourniquets are coming back into the mainstream. Using a tourniquet is simple, easy, and (in my opinion) should be part of a public safety course/first aid/CPR for civilians. You have HOURS (if tourniquet applied correctly) before you risk ANY harm to the limb. (And remember! Life > limb, regardless. So that argument is out.)   You do not need to loosen it every fifteen minutes. That's the exact opposite of what you're trying to do. You do need to check for pulses in the extremity very frequently- if you feel one, readjust till there isn't one. Double tourniquets are a thing, I've had to do it on people before. You are restricting blood flow. A pulse means that the person has blood flow and they will continue to bleed out. Once you apply it, hospital staff need to be the ones removing it, not you. In my trauma scenario, I pictured a free flowing bloody calf that got ripped to shreds by a gravel road and is squirting blood that you can't stop with direct pressure alone. (Guess I should've said femoral, I wasn't thinking straight. Either way.) Put the tourniquet on the femoral artery, as high as you can, and cinch it tight. If that doesn't help, double tourniquet it.   Tourniquets are a very underrated emergency medical device, in my opinion. We carry several on the ambulance. They're good use for GSWs, deep cuts, lacerations, arterial bleeding from pretty much anywhere. It's easier to remove a tourniquet than remove a limb. We might use them more than you think. Open fractures that are bleeding and you can't put pressure on because bone is protruding, etc. They're very useful and can be used for several situations.   Another local EMS company near me actually does civilian first aid training, and they are doing a good job in removing public stigma around tourniquets in our huge metropolitan area. ""Stop the Bleed!"" is really great too.   As for in-field debridement: if I have the chance to squirt some saline and remove the dirt from a wound (and the bleeding IS CONTROLLED) I do en route to the hospital. If they're so messed up that I got called because of a GSW or severe accident, I'm going to be a little too busy maintaining airway, keeping BP up, etc to do much. We'll be at the facility that can take their time to clean it properly versus my crude knock-up job when I really need to focus on doing other things. If I have an extra hand or some firefighters, I might ask them to help me if I have everything else under control. (S/O to my fire guys, you rock!)   I hope I answered all the questions and cleared some stuff up in the edit. I will totally try to get back to all that commented! Baby boy is craving some tacos, now I gotta go make some tacos at 7am... my husband will be very confused when he wakes up, lol. "
It depends on what made the cut and how bad it is.  I'm assuming this isn't a sterile surgical cut, or a massive trauma.  No risk of bleeding to death, no gross impaction of foreign material into the would.  If so, it would be best to wash with soap and water to get any small amounts of debris/bacteria out.  Dry, and put a bandage on that will apply a bit of pressure and help the wound heal.  Keep the edges of the wound clean and approximated next to each other so they can heal together.
Neither, but more option B than A. Pressure is one of the keys with first aid for open wounds, and assists the healing process greatly. Certainly don't wipe, this will greatly extend the healing time and has potential to leave scarring.  [EDIT] Disclosure: I work with mines rescue and the first aid we provide is specific to the environment we work in and may not be applicable to all scenarios. Nontheless, basic first aid doesn't really change.
>Typically, its best to wash the cut with antibacterial soap (like Dial)   In the US, isn't antibacterial soap now outlawed (to normal consumers)? Because of the massive introduction of antibiotics to the environment leading to resistance?  >exsanguinated  fun word
This response is amazing! Thank you so much!
Is it therefore true then that a precise cut or a sever trauma is best to be left to clot and scab over? 
Antibiotic and anti-bacterial are not the same - all soap is antibacterial to a degree. The US is also unusual in that you can buy antibiotic creams like neosporin over the counter - in the uk for instance you would buy antibacterial cream (like germolene) to put on a cut rather than antibiotic 
It doesn't matter. Regular soap works just as fine. The antibacterial properties of antibacterial soap is overexaggerated anyway, unless you actually use a true desinfectant like chlorhexidine. Most of the antibacterial properties comes from washing away the bacteria, which normal soap is excellent at.
honestly it depends on a bunch of factors. Nick yourself shaving? Probably don't need much more than a splash of water to get any shaving scream and stray hairs off the area.  Cut yourself while slicing veggies? Again, probably don't even need soap depending on how severe the wound is.  Cut yourself while slicing meat? Antibacterial soap.  Large cuts/wounds, especially ones that just won't stop bleeding (but not enough to be life threatening) just flush with sterile water or normal saline.  life threatening wound? stop the bleeding as quickly as possible, no matter what. Even if you've got chunks of road or metal or whatever stuck in it, bandage around the debris (as the debris might actually be helping keep some of the blood vessels closed off). Once you get to the hospital, they'll be able to take care of proper wound cleaning/debridement and making sure it doesn't get infected.  source: hospital corpsman for 7-1/2 years
Well, again, many assumptions, but new skin can't really go through a big, thick, dried-out scab.  Wounds heal in from the edges, so the better you can keep the wound edges touching and unobstructed the better you are.
Antibiotics kill bacteria or inhibit their growth. Antiseptics destroy vegetative cells and discourage growth, on a biological surface. Disinfectants are the same as antiseptics, except not meant for a biological surface. Sterilization removes all microbes. Sanitization only reduces the number of microbes, and typically is used on an eating or drinking utensil.   In the end, they get used interchangeably at times.   Antibiotics are the good/bad ones, that are great for dire circumstances but can breed resistant bacteria when they’re overused (generally if you’re not prescribed an antibiotic, don’t use it. It’s not that it’s hurting you, it’s that by using it you’re helping select for the most resistant bacteria)
Not Gorilla Glue, that's polyurethane. Super glue or cyanoacrylate is used for closing wounds. Whenever I get a cut on my hand, I'll clean the wound, dry it, and close it with cyanoacrylate. Stays on much better than a band aid and is waterproof. Falls off in a few days, but by then the wound is usually closed up enough. 
This is less of an earth science question and more of an economics / consumer psychology question (which as an earth scientist, I'm not going to be particularly able to answer). From a very basic level though, there are a lot of assumptions baked into this as a line of reasoning, e.g. that consumers (or most people in general) understand risk assessments, etc. The faulty (ha, pun not intended) line of reasoning could equally be applied to the continued existence / expansion of population centers in earthquake prone regions, e.g. 'If earthquakes are real, why haven't we seen a plummeting of real estate prices in Los Angeles as the time since the last major earthquake increases?'.  That being said, some quick browsing does suggest that there are the early signs of what you're describing (though none of these could be construed as a crash in real-estate prices at this point, more that there does appear to be a measurable influence of sea level rise on home prices), e.g. [Bernstein et al 2018](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3073842) showing that houses more in danger of sea level rise sold for 7% less than equivalent less risky homes or [Keenan et al 2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabb32) showing a price premium being placed on homes at higher elevation in south Florida.
A lot of good answers in here i would just like to make one final point. Almost all predictions of sea level rise says that we wont see anything large untill the next century so buying a water front property now means that even your grand children might be spared any real damdage from rising waters(exluding more frequent floods etc)
While maybe not drastic at this point, we are definitely seeing reductions in real-estate prices due to climate change. Here are three studies that were highlighted by [a Washington Post article from last year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/sea-level-rise-is-eroding-home-value-and-owners-might-not-even-know-it/2018/08/20/ff63fa8c-a0d5-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html):  [Disaster on the Horizon: The Price Effect of Sea Level Rise](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3073842)  [Climate gentrification: from theory to empiricism in Miami-Dade County, Florida](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabb32)  [Rising Seas Erode $15.8 Billion in Home Value from Maine to Mississippi](https://firststreet.org/press/rising-seas-erode-15-8-billion-in-home-value-from-maine-to-mississippi/) (Updated)
In nuclear engineering, we occupy ourselves with a lot of risk assessment and probability.  One thing I realized that people are not just bad at assessing risk, they are terrible.   You see the similar results from both people who are ignorant (underestimate the consequences) and people are are educated on the topic ( underestimate the probability).  Climate change is not unlike people who smoke and those who are worried about terrorist attacks. Some do not think the consequences will be that dramatic/that rapid, there are those who think the probability that *they* will be affected is not that high.  People in real estate, honesty don't give a shit. You will frequently hear them saying that the new developments takes into account of the sea level rise. No one really asks for the details.  I am not entirely if it's still true in in US, but private insurance does not typically cover flood and is in fact subsidized (?) by the government. Here too the insurance companies don't give a shit as long it's not them who bear the risk.
Here's a report analyzing the question from a real estate/investment perspective: https://www.heitman.com/news/climate-risk-and-real-estate-investment-decision-making/  Also, some relevant stats in another real estate article: https://www.allpropertymanagement.com/blog/post/what-climate-change-means-for-coastal-real-estate-values/  And a research paper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabb32  > Climate gentrification: from theory to empiricism in Miami-Dade County, Florida  > This article provides a conceptual model for the pathways by which climate change could operate to impact geographies and property markets whose inferior or superior qualities for supporting the built environment are subject to a descriptive theory known as 'Climate Gentrification.' The article utilizes Miami-Dade County, Florida (MDC) as a case study to explore the market mechanisms that speak to the operations and processes inherent in the theory. This article tests the hypothesis that the rate of price appreciation of single-family properties in MDC is positively related to and correlated with incremental measures of higher elevation (the 'Elevation Hypothesis'). As a reflection of an increase in observed nuisance flooding and relative SLR, the second hypothesis is that the rates of price appreciation in lowest the elevation cohorts have not kept up with the rates of appreciation of higher elevation cohorts since approximately 2000 (the 'Nuisance Hypothesis'). The findings support a validation of both hypotheses and suggest the potential existence of consumer preferences that are based, in part, on perceptions of flood risk and/or observations of flooding.
"Not sure how the US system works. But in EU while real estate price doesn't drop. Home insurance premiums are based on the ""risk"" of your area. And quite a few areas have been re classed due to climate change. Thus while these peoples home hasn't dropped in value there insurance premium has doubled."
Furthermore, OP's question assumes that markets operate rationally. That's actually not universally accepted among economists.
This is the only real answer. Very few models project sea levels to rise enough to impact real estate within your lifetime.
Just to clarify here, the U.S. doesn’t give everybody free flood insurance. There’s FEMA disaster relief, but that might get you $15k on $200k worth of damages if you don’t have an insurance policy. I witnessed that happen to a lot of people in my hometown after Hurricane Sandy.   You still have to pay for flood insurance under the a National Flood Insurance Program. Perhaps a subsidized rate, but your post makes sound like the Government guarantees it for all, which it does not.  The program was fully funded by its premiums up until Hurricane Katrina in 2004. Since that time the NFIP has gone $25 Bn into debt. It’s definitely an unspoken problem that’s getting worse.
"This was French to me, but the ""climate gentrification"" bit stood out.  I know this isn't what the paper studied, but it seems to me that when you're thinking about buying a multi-million dollar beach home (which seems to be most beach homes these days)... you can afford the insurance. You don't care if it floods. It's an acceptable risk to you because you're wealthy enough that no single disaster could possibly take everything from you."
The United States has a federally funded flood insurance program. This program is deeply flawed because it isn't priced adequately which distorts the market by encouraging people to build in areas that are going to flood. Then there's also political pressure to prevent legislation that will prevent people from building in these areas.   Fresh air had a show about this recently: https://www.npr.org/2019/10/17/770812863/geography-of-risk-calculates-who-pays-when-a-storm-comes-to-shore
Insurance companies will often not cover damage from floods if the structure is in an area known to be prone to flooding. Doesn't matter to a billionaire but there are plenty of beach houses owned by people who are rich but not *that* rich.   Also consider that we aren't just talking literal beachfront property. In places like south Florida there are huge areas that are vulnerable to flooding which can be miles inland.
Having survived a flood, I'm afraid you're underestimating the impact of natural disasters, regardless of wealth. Some things are irreplaceable: mementos, photo albums, grandma's ashes. If you're not there in time—and I wasn't—these things are lost forever. Time is also a factor. It's no mean feat to purchase a new home, to relocate whatever remains of your material possessions, buy all the new kitchen equipment you spent a lifetime acquiring, and on and on. Wealth doesn't save you from having to supervise all these, even if you can contract everything else out.  It's a real dickshow. I do not recommend. It was such an enormous interruption that I sort of mentally separate my life between the antediluvian and the postdiluvian. Eight years on, I *still* find myself searching for certain items, only to realize I must have lost them in the flood.
Keep in mind that the rise in sea level could compromise the infrastructure near your home, as well as shift marshlands inland and otherwise reduce productivity of the region.  In other words: while you're home might be fine, the neighborhood might look a whole lot different.
In this case, it was easy - the fire was seen when it started, reported, firefighters attended and extinguished the fire in that flat - but not before the fire spread to the outside of the building. The questions to be answered here are engineering ones - why a cladding material that would have been designed and tested as safe proved to be so unsafe in practice.  But even in less obvious cases, the source of the ignition is often obvious. When ignition happens, there is lots of oxygen there, so things burn completely. When the fire gets going, there's less oxygen available, so things burn partially. Fire generally burns up - so the source of a fire is often the only thing on the floor that is badly burned.  Edit: Lots of good replies to my comment - including some fire investigators that state that the source of the fire is usually less combusted than the surroundings, as they burn cooler before the fire gets going.
My father is a fire investigator. I asked him the same question. He showed me photos of the last one he determined the cause. All the knobs on the stove were off besides one. It melted obviously being on. The people had left the stove on. They start at the area that has the most fire damage then look for something that isn't how it should be. 
I'm sure someone who understands how burn patterns work will be able to explain it to you in the more general case ... but it has to do with the fact that things don't burn out completely, and the scorch marks are different where the fire started and was small.  In this particular case, however, a big helping hand came from the fact that the guy who lived in the flat where it started told people that his fridge caught fire, and it went from there.  Don't have a source right now, but some of the initial reports of the fire quoted some guy as saying his neighbour told him it was his fridge.
"I'm a certified indoor firefighter.  At the fire academy, we learned how cheaply houses are built nowadays and what to look/listen for in a fire.  A lot of buildings now have what are called truss roofs.  One beam is stretched from wall to wall and smaller beams are fanned out from the center of the beam to support the roof.  To attach the supports most of the time, an aluminum plate is attached and get this, staples or rivets are used, not nails.    When a fire is hot enough, it will make the plate expand, causing the staples/rivets to ""pop out"", making this metallic pinging noise.  If you hear that noise, you need to get out NOW because the roof is coming down.  Construction doesn't include the attic vent sometimes.  This vent is designed to allow the flow of superheated gases to escape the top of the house, preventing a flashover.  Everything is made of plastic nowadays, some which burns at 1200 F, while your turnout gear is good to 800 F.  So many dangers to be aware of in fires nowadays.  I love it when people ask me if I have a fear of being immolated.  I always tell them that I'm too busy thinking of other things, to be worried about that."
I used to be a wildland firefighter and often sources of the fire were found the same way. I'd see the ropped off initial source by fire inspectors and it would be ash gray because the fire completely burned, and every where else further on was black, not completely burned. Then from there they might find a cigarette butt, firework remnants, lightning burns, campfire ring, or in some cases i believe chemical testing would be done to find accelerants, etc.
[The Geometry of Fire Investigation: Interpreting Fire Patterns by Doug Leihbacher](http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-169/issue-1/features/the-geometry-of-fire-investigation-interpreting-fire-patterns.html) is a good read on the subject.

If the source of the fire is usually badly burned, in this case the fridge freezer, then is it just a presumption when they say the cause was an electrical fault, or can they actually prove this with the remains of the fridge? 
I've always wanted to know how if a building collapse interferes with the investigation.  I would imagine, depending on factors, that such an event would almost completely destroy the evidence (thinking a +20 storey building, not a typical house)
"Its also extremely imprecise.  The major problem is people investigating this on a local level in the US arent properly trained.  If you ever want to be sick to your stomach google ""Cameron Todd Willingham"" and see what we did to him over now debunked fire investigation techniques. "
What are the signs if a fire was started by a lightning strike?
Counterpoint: [Trial By Fire - Did Texas execute an innocent man? by David Grann, The New Yorker] (http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/07/trial-by-fire)
Copper wiring won't burn and there are signs you can spot that show it shorted.   Also - it's a fridge. Pretty much the only option for it starting a fire is an electrical fault. 
The fire remains localized for a period of time consuming that available oxygen in the room while it is still consuming it's original fuel package.  Convective air currents draw fresh air into the seat of the fire, the fire spits out products of combustion(smoke, oxygen deficient air), heat, and light.    By the time the fire spreads the available oxygen in the immediate area is less than what was available to the initial fuel package.    This explanation is true for compartment fires.   Free burning camp fires, brush fires, small fires, and similar will behave differently because of the lack of confinement and oxygen availability.
It may not be easy, but it is possible. Fire investigations are kind of like archaeological digs. There are layers of everything, and by digging through the layers, peeling them away piece by piece, investigators are able to determine where items were, at which point they fell, etc. 
Recent research suggests that they don't. Determinations of arson (by use of accelerants) by fire investigators is highly questionable.
"My first fire in the department I volunteer for was a lightning strike. I couldnt tell for the life of me what started it. The investigators showed up, walked to the collapsed chimney, said ""yup, lightning strike"" and basically left. I asked them how the hell they ID'd it so fast and they basically said that one big indicator would be the damm lightning storm that just passed and that the sand in the mortar and bricks of the chimney had turned to glass from the intensity of the lightning. So simple, but it blew my mind."
one option in the correct soil is lightning glass or [fulgerite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgurite). The lighting carries on down through the soil fusing the silica into glass it forms in branching lightning patterns in the ground
"Wood turning to ash doesn't mean it burned hotter.  It means that it burned completely.  When wood ""burns"" in a low oxygen environment, it doesn't actually burn so much as it releases gasses, oils, and water vapor, which leaves behind charcoal.  Charcoal, however, will burn hotter than wood, because it's pure fuel.  A wood fire loses energy to evaporating water.  To unsubscribe from FireFacts, please text ""OMG STOP""."
"Fire investigation has come a long way in the last 26 years. Fire investigation used to be considered an ""art"" ... it is now science based, using the scientific method to form and test hypotheses of how fires start. It is extremely unfortunate and sad that criminal proceedings have been based on investigation methods that were nothing more than wives' tales. It is fortunate, however, that the fire investigation community has developed into the science/fact based investigation community that it is today.  Edit: I need to add some info here about the legitimacy of the fire investigation field - Being that fire investigation is based on the scientific method, I have to conclude that fire investigation is not in fact a junk science. I do agree with the many people, however, that there are plenty of junk fire investigators who base their decisions on junk science (hypotheses that are not tested properly, experiments that are not done properly, wives tales and lore). But this is not to say that all fire investigators are wizards with a magic water stick pointing their way to the origin of a fire.   There are a large number of fire investigators who are dedicated to true fire investigation and the scientific method, and to furthering the field with experimentation. I think that saying all fire investigation is junk and illegitimate is doing those men and women a disservice. "
Depends on how they reach that conclusion. If it's solely a judgement call based on visual clues, then yeah that's questionable. For instance, some polymer flooring materials can melt during a fire and form burning pools of molten plastic that leave pretty much identical marks to what you expect to find if someone poured gasoline on the floor.  We always take samples to be chemically analyzed (i think by gas spectroscopy?) in order to verify or disprove any theories of accelerant use. Control samples must be taken from spots where you don't suspect anything, and of course there may be benign reasons for an accelerant to be present (like a bottle of lamp oil or booze or whatever stored somewhere near where the fire started).  Most importantly fire investigation must always be done as a process of elimination, trying to disprove all possible causes until you're hopefully only left with one. Starting with a theory and trying to prove it is a recipe for miscarriage of justice.  Oh, and people do sometimes set stuff on fire for the insurance money. Oftentimes they get away with it too- but greed often gets them eventually. Statiastically few people suffer more than one fire in their lifetime, so when a guy files his sixth fire insurance someone is going to ask pointed questions (real world example there; one man claimed to have lost multiple boats and buildings in mysterious fires over a couple of decades. The fires would always start when some renovation project ground to a standstill or expensive repairs were needed).
>  a spark or open flame can ignite it.  Both notably not supposed to be present at the back of a fridge, so it had to be the coolant leak + spark/fire source, which most likely would be due to an electrical fault
"Oh shoot!  As a geoscientist and a huge Subnautica fan, I'm sorry to come in late on this.  **No**, the lava depicted in the lava zone is completely unrealistic (but *so* cool.)  Let me comment on the pieces of the answer that people have already given:  As /u/Little_Mouse points out, real underwater volcanism on Earth doesn't have much glow to it: the water cools the lava so fast that it's almost all dark except for a few glints of red.  Their video was taken at shallow depth by a scuba diver: here's a video from 1 km deep, similar to the lava zone in Subnautica:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmMlspNoZMs  No glowing pools, no red lava falls.  Water is a fantastic reservoir for heat, and the fact that warm water rises lets it carry away heat by convection really *really* well.  /u/PresidentRex has a great analysis of pressures and the phase diagram of water, but there's one thing they didn't realize: **hot supercritical water is always less dense than cold**, as shown in the graphs [here](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_density.html).  Thus, there will be no ""stable layer of supercritical water"": it would be buoyant, rise, and be replaced by cool water, carrying away heat by convection.  What if the layer of water near the lava surface had a ton of salts dissolved in it, so it was denser?  As /u/Bassmanbiff points out, the thermal radiation law applies to *everything*, not just rock: the supercritical water layer *itself* would glow.  But that's clearly not what we see in Subnautica, and in any case the water above this layer would still convect, rapidly cooling it just as if it were lava itself.  Finally, as /u/UniqueUserTheSecond points out, there's a thermometer in the game, and it reads 70 degrees C in the active lava zone.  That's probably a reasonable temperature, actually -- note that in the video I linked to, the submersible isn't damaged by the volcano's heat, and /u/Little_Mouse 's video was taken by a scuba diver swimming just a few feet from the lava!  But this is nowhere near the temperature at which stuff starts to glow -- no matter what stuff.  As a side note, several people are commenting on air pressure and O2.  One thing's for sure: the way Subnautica handles air and breathing at depth is completely wrong, and trying to dive the way you can in Subnautica would kill you dead.  Nobody in the real world has done a dive on pressurized gas to a depth greater than 700 meters, the people who've done it to a depth below 100 meters only do so with hours of preparation, a special gas mixture, and slow cautious pressure changes, and even then many people who've tried to dive below 300 meters have died.  The vehicles and seabases behave as if they are at sea-level pressure (if they weren't, they wouldn't implode if you take them too deep), but you can't just hop from 800 meters of pressure into your sea-level pressure vehicle without dying immediately.  And let's not even talk about how moonpools work....  Of course, a realistic approach to lava and air pressure wouldn't make for nearly as fun a game!"
I can't speak directly to lava coexisting next to saltwater at depth, but there's some other misinformation thrown about this thread that I wanted to clear up:  **Lava temperature**  Lava glows because of [thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation). This is linked with the concept of blackbody radiation, where matter emits electromagnetic radiation based on its temperature. All matter emits this radiation above absolute zero, but the color becomes visible to humans around 800 K (980 °F/526 °C) as a dull red. As temperature increases further, objects appear yellow and then white hot (possibly with a tinge of blue).  The in-game lava is a deep red, so it's likely on the lower end of visible thermal radiation (800 - 1000 K). So while it's possible the lava doesn't have the same composition as typical earth-like lavas, it can't have a temperature much lower (e.g. lead melts at 600 K, but you can melt lead without it emitting a red glow).   **Atmospheric composition and air pressure**  The planet in Subnautica could have an atmosphere of anywhere between about 0.4 to maybe 5 atm of pressure. The partial pressures (pp) of various gases in the atmosphere are the important part for humans. [Partial pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure) is neat because if you take out the percentage of each gas in a gas mixture, the partial pressure would be equal to that percentage. Earth's atmosphere is (currently) 21% oxygen and basically 1 atm at sea level; that means that the oxygen has a partial pressure of 0.21 atm. On Mount Everest with a pressure around 0.33 atm, that's 0.07 atm of oxygen partial pressure. We need about 0.15 atm of partial pressure to breathe over the long term, but we can survive in less for brief periods (minutes/hours).   On the other extreme, our bodies would suffer if the [composition in a high-pressure environment was not just right](http://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1970.29.1.23). Non-noble gases start having detrimental effects at high partial pressures - including oxygen. Oxygen-related problems can start at 0.3 atm pp (aside from a risk of fire, this is one reason why we don't use 100% oxygen atmospheres at earth-like pressures in spacecraft), but up to 2 atm can be used [for short periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas#Oxygen). Carbon dioxide starts negatively affecting us around 0.06 atm of pp. Nitrogen narcosis is also well known in diving circles. The only somewhat safe options are neon and helium, and they can even start affecting our cell structures at extreme pressures. This really only applies to a human on the surface breathing air, though.    **Pressure at depth**  (Tiny edit: I should note that these pressure calculations are based on normal earth gravity. Higher gravity means more pressure for equivalent depth; lighter gravity means less pressure for equivalent depth.)  Atmospheric pressure ends up being of little concern once you get deeper. The water pressure exerted at 1300 m of depth is about 130 atm. Adding 0.5 or 4 atm on top of that is miniscule. Water at normal temperatures is still just a normal liquid at this pressure (as we can experience here on earth diving into deep ocean trenches). Nobody is really going to dive that deep on a regulator though; you'd need a pressurized tank to breathe (otherwise the water pressure would collapse your lungs) and the gases will do unpleasant things to your blood and body once you start breathing gases at those pressures. There are reasons the current free dive record is 214 m and the scuba record is 333 m.   As an explanation for the [phase diagram for water](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_phase_diagram.html): Temperature is the horizontal axis (in Kelvin); pressure is the vertical axis (usually in Pa and/or bar). The basic ice/water transition is the vertical line around 273 K (0 °C, naturally). In the big graph on that page, E is basically normal earth conditions (293 K or 20 °C and about 1 atm or 1 bar of pressure). Pressure in water (like any fluid) increases with depth. The rule of thumb is 10 m of water = 1 atm of pressure (technically it's 10.33 m = 1 bar, but everything else I wrote is in atm and 1 bar is just about 1 atm). This means you increase pressure by 1 atm each time you go another 10 m down.   **Phase state at pressure and temperature**   Water is a normal liquid at 130 atm at standard temperature. Water is a supercritical fluid at 130 atm at 800+ K. (I wouldn't recommend swimming in it; it'll do unpleasant things to your body other than just burning you). This means it will be stable and won't turn into steam because it's already a weird mixture of steam and water. Unfortunately, my chemistry isn't good enough to tell you how salt is going to affect this in detail (other than to say that solids tend to dissolve better at higher temperatures and pressures so it could be denser).  So, at the very least, it's at least plausible for the lava to sit there covered in a layer of supercritical, denser saltwater. 
The other possibility is that if the rocks are certain mixtures of lead and/or mercury and other low melting point metals, the lava could be much cooler than it is on earth.  Some have melting points around 30 C.
to people answering, i want to point out if we go super technical, this water must have a property we do not know about, there's light from the local star at 100+m depth, which is just impossible on earth and the player goes to depths of 300m with only a high tech wetsuit. This means i would imagine that the water on this planet is less dense than water on earth which might allow for other possible interactions than the usual
I can’t believe I didn’t notice that moon pools aren’t realistic! But yes, you’re right. If you tried to build a moon pool irl, you would just end up with a flooded compartment. 
Good explanation.  My understanding is that a supercritical fluid is not as dense as the liquid form, but much denser than the gas. This being the case, the supercritical water would rise in the column, then either cool back to liquid, or violently explode into steam.
If I recall correctly, there's actually no lower limit to how deep the wetsuit can go. At least 1700m. I chalk that one up to sci-fi future tech though. Probably a combination wetsuit/spacesuit designed to convert any gas atmosphere into breathable air, somehow allow you to survive any amount of liquid/gas pressure.
Moon pools can be done, but only if the air in the compartment is at the same pressure as the water outside.  That's easy enough in shallow water, but at depth that means breathing in your base has the same biophysical problems as scuba diving.
> but at depth that means breathing in your base has the same biophysical problems as scuba diving.  They are solvable. I remember watching a video where a few technicians were doing week-long deep dives and living in a pressurized chamber underwater to avoid slow ascents every day. Can't find a link though.  edit: found it, it's called *saturation diving*, there are many videos for this request.
The answer, as far as I can tell, is that we don’t know for certain. What we know about the development of pillows and bedding, however, suggests a few options.   I found this site which details the history of the pillow.   http://hankeringforhistory.com/pillows-throughout-the-ages-guest-post/  The oldest known pillows date back around 9,000 years and are made of carved stone. The shape suggests suggests an attempt at providing comfort...a smooth surface is much better for laying your head on, after all, than a rough one. It’s also been suggested by historians that pillows like this protected people from bugs. It’s possible, therefore, that cavemen used nearby rocks to keep their heads elevated.    This is not, however, the oldest known bedding. That dates back 77,000 years and consists of compressed grass, leaves, and plant stems found at archaeological site called the Sidubu Cave. Interestingly, the specific plants they found in the bedding served as natural insecticides, suggesting that protection from bugs was at the front of mind due cavemen as it was for ancient Egyptians. It’s possible a mound of this material was used on top of the bedding as a makeshift pillow. Here is the study.   http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/12/earliest-human-beds-found-south-africa  Lastly, the Japanese Geisha have used wooden blocks with cushioning on top to serve as a pillow. These blocks allowed them to protect their elaborate hair styles while sleeping. A log or other piece of wood, therefore, is a potential third option for cavemen pillows.   In the case of rocks and pillows, there’s no reason grass and leaves couldn’t have been used as a softer barrier to increase comfort. We wouldn’t know that, however, since such technology wouldn’t necessarily register with archaeologists if it wasn’t shaped or processed on some way such as to distinguish it from other debris.   Edit: the rocks are no longer imprisoned. TIL proofreading matters. 
Kind of relevant; a really fascinating thing in Nelson Mandela’s biography is when he describes sleeping on a mattress and experiencing pillows for the first time when he was a boy. The way he talks about it is so insane to me because I have always had such luxuries.  Edit* It’s from his book: A Long walk to freedom  Can’t be bothered with finding the part where he describes sleeping with pillows but here is a passage that alludes to it  https://ibb.co/egDt5H

> the key part of a pillow is not that it is fluffy, but that it allows your neck to rest in a natural position  The Royal Ontario Museum has a collection of ancient [Chinese stone pillows](https://www.google.ca/search?biw=1086&bih=736&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=UQ6wWrrVAebojwSzjZj4Cw&q=stone+pillow+china&oq=stone+pillow+china&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1799.2906.0.3202.6.6.0.0.0.0.97.455.6.6.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.4.318...0j0i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i24k1j0i8i30k1.0.JIF_xMr0hLg).

How would chimps/ great apes react if we just dropped a comfy king size mattress with pillows into their neighborhood?  Do you think they would sleep on it?
"Does ""incarcerated"" have a special meaning here? (I always thought it meant something like ""locked up in jail"", which doesn't quite make sense in this context).   Edit: It was supposed to be carved (fixed), which makes a lot more sense. "
RE: geisha wooden blocks  Every Korean bath house ( 찜질방 jjimjilbang) that I've  been to (I've been to many)  has an area for napping, and they all have wooden pillows called [목침 (mokchim)](http://image.auction.co.kr/itemimage/ea/6b/b7/ea6bb7e76.jpg). They are quite comfortable for a quick nap. I just wanted to point out that it's not something unique that geisha used only for their hair, it's common and normal to this day among the regular population (at least as far as bathhouse naps are concerned). 
Cultures that used stone pillows (including Egypt) have left quite a few for the archaeological record, but I take your point.
That sounds similar to how ancient Egyptians slept on beds with a crescent-shaped headrest. I assume they probably padded the headrest with linen or something, given that most of them shaved their heads and that leaves precious little cushion between your skull and hard wood edges, but would be similar to the Japanese takamakura.
They were common in Japan also. They usually had storage in them as well for a large blanket, then you could bring your whole bed with you wherever you traveled. 
Overall, people are more educated now than before. Educational attainment (that is, the percentage of people graduating high school and going to college) has [increased dramatically since the 40s.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Educational_Attainment_in_the_United_States_2009.png) Some even feel that college degrees are now too easy to get, or too prevalent in certain fields, and that people are compelled to become over-educated for even entry level positions.
"TLDR: Yes and no. There is no direct connection between having and education and then getting more education as a result. However, education leads to more money and more money leads to more opportunities for education and more success in obtaining education, both for an individual and for that individual's children. It would be perfectly correct to say that the Wealth Gap has created an Education Gap because the American education system is so dependent upon local economies.  -----  Sociology professor here.  It can be stated as a scientific fact that [wealth inequality exists in America.](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FpkMaxCWUsMC&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=america+wealth+disparity&ots=mfq68ureXx&sig=3pdwpch0YiMTgCa2g2QS8eoRVJU#v=onepage&q=america%20wealth%20disparity&f=false). It can also be stated as a scientific fact that [wealthy individuals are more likely to graduate high school, graduate college, and obtain advanced degrees](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-EiLBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=america+wealth+disparity&ots=UUSV9oWRtc&sig=uN3VqNhDi4H_TaB14KEdeIzlRXI#v=onepage&q&f=false). Therefore, the wider the inequality in wealth the wider the inequality in education.  However, there is a worse problem that's hidden in that statement. Education attainment is not a perfect indicator of how educated a person is. That's sort of counter intuitive, so here is an example:  Group A) A poor section of town has low property values which means less taxes that fund schools. This then means that the school cannot hire the best teachers because it cannot pay very well. This means that the education being received by students is delivered by average or below average teachers, that textbooks and campus facilities are more likely to be outdated, and that after-school activities and extra curriculars are more likely to utilize sub-par equipment.  Group B) A wealthy neighborhood has high property values which means plenty of funding for schools. They can afford high salaries, so many teachers apply to work here, meaning the school can select the best of the best. They also have money to keep their facilities and extra curricular activities up to date.  Now if both Group A and Group B have a perfect 100% graduation rate, can we say that the students that graduate have the same education? Yes and no. They passed 12th grade, but in one situation the academics were more rigorous and the education included more than just the bare minimum. So on one hand we can point to statistics that say America's graduation rates are increasing, so we must be smarter. On the other hand, our schools are getting less funding and in some neighborhoods the curriculum are more lax, therefore the graduation rates increasing may be showing that our schools are getting easier to pass.  Some studies have shown that [private schools emphasize critical thought and leadership, while public schools are more likely to emphasize discipline, cooperation, and obedience](http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/WQ_VOL11_W_1987_Research.pdf). Is this a disparity? In a way. Leadership and critical thought are skills needed in management and entrepreneurial jobs, while cooperation and obedience are more useful in menial labor. This isn't specifically tied to school funding, but it is worth noting that education quality will affect job prospects and success.  Lawmakers and policy makers are well aware of these trends. To correct for this, America has the ""No Child Left Behind"" law which forces all public schools to meet at least a minimum standard of education. The problem is that some schools barely meet it, while other (well funded) schools exceed it by leaps and bounds.  Some states also have a ""Robinhood"" law which takes excess money from wealthy neighborhoods and redistributes it to poor neighborhoods to keep schools from becoming too polarized. These are effective, but not perfect, and I'm not an expert on this area so I'll leave it at that.  However, all of this just says that the wealth gap creates an education gap. So the next question is, does higher education create more education?  For an individual, no. Most people seek a particular degree, and then stop seeking education. If education snowballed like the OP implies that then we'd have individuals who obtain dozens of Ph.D's, and that's pretty rare.  It is common, though, that [educated parents are more likely to raise educated children](http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2005-06518-016) (pay wall). There's a lot of different factors here, mostly having to do with parent's higher education meaning more income and more free time. At the same time, this social fact is why colleges have programs set aside to specifically help first generation college students. People who go to college when their parent's hadn't gone to college are [half as likely to graduate](https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/classroom-resources/first-generation-college-students-graduation-rates/) as students whose parents do have a degree.  In summary, the answer is a soft yes. There is an education gap in america and it is growing, but it has more to do with the wealth gap and school funding than with education specifically."
"I think you need to define ""we"". This would be very different for each countries laws. Things like access to education, ability to use that education to actually benefit lifestyle, etc, will dictate the answer to this question."
Sort of.  To be clear, overall education rates have gone way up - more people are getting bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and PhDs now than were historically. This is not such a good thing for bachelor's degrees - only about a third of jobs require such, but about 2/3rds of young people go to college, and about half of them are getting degrees. This is resulting in the value of college degrees dropping and inflation in what degrees people are asking for for jobs - there are lots of jobs that ask for bachelor's degrees now which really don't need to, but can because there's an excess of them.  However, on the other hand, in recent years, college attendance has leveled off a bit as a result of this.  We've seen a modest decline in overall college attendance in the last few years, but [we've been seeing the largest drop in low-income people going to college,](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/25/study-finds-drop-percentage-low-income-students-enrolling-college) and low-income people were less likely to go to college to begin with.  But you asked about education. This, too, is so; children of more educated families are more likely to go to college.  Contrary to what many people might expect, this is not an American trend; in Norway, we've seen the same thing:  > [And what happens is that — even though it’s essentially free — only 14 percent of children from the least-educated families in Norway go to college, compared to 58 percent of children from the most-educated families, according to an analysis by a Norwegian education researcher, Elisabeth Hovdhaugen.](http://hechingerreport.org/in-norway-where-college-is-free-children-of-uneducated-parents-still-dont-go/)  Interestingly, this bottom-end rate is indistinguishable from the bottom-end rate in the United States (13%), suggesting that it is primarily cultural factors, not economic ones, which control college attendance.
The question is about education disparity among classes, not the general trend of educated populations.
"Unfortunately, this is one of those questions where the answer could just as easily be ""42."" Quantifying ""well-educated"" is a little hard to do unless you set the parameters for your question.  For example, if you consider literacy vs. being illiterate a huge gap in relative education, then it would be easy to find statistics supporting an argument that ""no, more and more people can read so the 'well-educated' gap is closing.""  On the other end if the spectrum, getting a grad degree or PhD is a lot easier (at least in the US) for the poor to achieve as grants and loans are readily available -- especially in the sciences -- to anyone who obtained a bachelor's.   Likewise, if you look at valuable tech skills, like computer programming, you don't *need* to even incur massive debt or PhDs to be more proficient than most of the population.   However, your question gets a lot harder to answer if you consider whether the rich and poor obtain sufficient *high school* education to break into college and beyond. On that question, I'd say *yes* -- at least in the US -- because there's a [strong correlation between the amounts of money collected by property taxes and the effectiveness of public schools.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/property-taxes-and-unequal-schools/497333/)  If you grow up in a poor neighborhood, you are likely to attend a poorly funded school, which will limit your options at college... and beyond. As the wealth gap increases, so too do the communities who fund the schools. And the entire concept of ""feeder"" private schools for the ivy leagues, don't do any favors for the poor, either.  So, it really depends what you are looking at. Education is getting better on the whole, but the ceiling is much more obvious for poor communities (again, in the US) than for the rich, and there's nothing to suggest that's going to change any time soon. "
"Good point. Let's have, if we can ideally, 5× ""we"".  Is there a trend of an increasing educational gap:  • globally?  • in [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country) overall?  • in [developing countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country) overall?  • in Europe/EU? (depending on what data can be found)  • in the US?  Any of the 5 would be great."
There are [similar statistics](http://m.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/soziale-situation-in-deutschland/61656/bildungsstand) for Germany (where education is also free). Teenagers with educated parents tend to go for high school diplomas more often and go to university more often. This even holds when only comparing children with similar educational performance (grades).
It's materially irrelevant when the graph is about percentages of the overall population. 90% of people over 25 now have a basic level of educational attainment, up from 20% in the 40s. Almost 30% of people in the country have a college degree, up from 5% in the 40s.   What I'm saying is that those are levels of attainment that cannot be brushed off as only going to the upper classes. The upper classes simply do not make up that much of the population.
His graph is on percentage of people receiving higher education, not net education. That indirectly shows that the lower classes are receiving more education than before, since the upper class is a small portion of the population and was already well educated.
I dunno, the same is true (everyone is doing better than in the 40's) about income disparity but people brush that off all the time.   But I guess education has a hard cap while income seems to be unlimited.  
The difference is income can be viewed as an average, thus skewing to the highest earners. Education is more of a yes/no thing, especially for degrees. 
Non-human primates lack the neurological regions responsible for producing speech as well as the musculature in the throat. There are several theories of how language and learned vocalizations evolved in humans, songbirds, parrots, bats, and cetaceans (whales, dolphins), but a general consensus is that it arose independently several times. Some of my favorite neuroscientists who write about this are Erich Jarvis and Johan Bolhuis. Both are songbird researchers. Jarvis has a three part series on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/E0MtW9URFhg) about this if you want to learn more. I haven't watched it but have seen him lecture a few times and he does a great job explaining it.   Also, I wouldn't refer to parrots as lesser animals in terms of intelligence. Corvids and parrots have exhibited a wide range of intelligent behaviors that was once considered only available to humans and some other apes such as tool use and recursive learning. A recent [study](http://m.pnas.org/content/113/26/7255.full) has shown that the density of neurons in birds' brains, especially parrots and songbirds, are comparable to humans and primates.
Most of these answers are mainly about Primates, but not much about Parrots. Thing is, Parrots dont 'emulate' Human speech. They are just very good at repeating sounds. When a Parrots says 'Polly wants a cracker' its not really talking, it's simply Repeating <Sound A> as it has learned it gets an interaction when it does so. I cant think of any evidence that Parrots can put words in sequences or use them in any way that indicates an actual language. They can just reproduce the sounds they hear neaby.
"It's because of their throats. Human throat is designed in a way that it can be willfully moved in a way to produce delicate sounds. Primate's throats are not.  Primates do have a certain capacity to learn ""language"" though. Chimpanzees have been told sign language (of course they're not capapble to use it on a human level) and they even pass their language knowledge onto off-spring.  Just a side note, one shouldn't automatically assume that closer related to humans = the most intelligent animals. Capuchin monkeys possess some cognitive abilities superior to apes, and the same is possibly true of some cetaceans, corvidae and parrots.  Parrots produce sounds in a complete different way as humans, so as far as I know the way they produce sound is more different to us than that of apes such as chimpanzees."
Parrots evolved to emulate the sounds of their surroundings to survive, to confuse the competition or predators. Monkeys' environment so far has demanded that they use their voice only for advance warning or intracommunal communication.
"What, scientifically, makes these animals ""lesser""? I think your question is misguided in origin. Birds evolved differently in order to mimic many sounds. Primates today have a common ancestor with humans we don't trace our lineage directly to them so it makes sense that we have abilities they lack.   I think you should careful of thinking of any species as ""lesser"" because it's not scientific and won't help you to reach accurate conclusions. "
Just a fun observation regarding macaques and the Wernicke's area: I spent a short time working with research macaques for a major pharmaceutical developer. When I worked with them, they absolutely loved hearing me (or almost anyone) sing to them. They listened as though they were trying to derive some sort of important message or meaning from it.  Also they're very smelly and naughty.  I tried to make them as happy and comfortable as possible while I worked there and I still think about them and the other animals often.
I agree with you up to the point that you suggest parrots don't use language or speech. They certainly speak to each other and large parrots such as African Greys have been shown to have an understanding of the words and phrases they use regularly.
Eh, the situation surrounding the legendary African Grey parrot Alex makes it pretty clear that the bird actually understood language and had the sentience to use it, even to the point of asking actual questions.
">Primates do have a certain capacity to learn ""language"" though. Chimpanzees have been told sign language (of course they're not capapble to use it on a human level) and they even pass their language knowledge onto off-spring.  While this is absolutely true I also think it's important to note that a Chimp or Gorilla has never posed a question to a human before.  They seem to not understand that other things can have thoughts."
Based on what I just read, I wonder if they tried to interpret your singing as a warning call and were wondering what kind of eldritch abomination you were warning them about.
I've linked the video with the computer models all around, but [Here](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/12/e1600723) is the publication.  [This](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438814000816) is also a really good read all around, and Breedlove's Behavioral Neuroscience is a really great reference book for this stuff if you can get your hands on a copy
"You're probably thinking of Alex the African Grey Parrot and the work Dr. Irene Pepperberg did on animal cognition. He asked what color he was, and learned that he was grey. > Looking at a mirror, he said ""what color"", and learned ""grey"" after being told ""grey"" six times.[15] This made him the first and only non-human animal to have ever asked a question (apes who have been trained to use sign-language have so far failed to ever ask a single question).[16] Alex's ability to ask questions (and to answer to Pepperberg's questions with his own questions) is documented in numerous articles and interviews.  Something I like about him is that he was once presented with a fruit he didn't know (an apple) and called it a banerry because he thought it was somewhere between a banana and a cherry. He would sometimes correct other African Greys if they were making mistakes in their own learning, which is both cute and pretty astounding I think.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_(parrot)"
"Selective breeding is good at quickly refining a pool of existing traits down to what the breeder wants, but it's limited by the same thing as evolution: rate of mutation. If a breeder wants to make a smart dog, they are limited by the theorical ""smartest possible dog"" the genes in the current population can create. Once you've bred that dog, you have to wait many generations for dog brains to mutate, which will create a new population with a new ""smartest possible dog.""  Humans, in our evolution, had extreme natural selection pressure for intelligence, but it still took millions of years for language, fire, farming, and all that other good stuff, because selection, whether natural or directed by us, can only *select* from the variety of traits mutation provides."
"I'd agree, I think the thing I was trying to say is that when one says ""Polly Want A Cracker"" its not actually speaking a sentence as we know, with the 4 words all having a distinct meaning, its merely repeating a sound. Now, its ability to use these sounds as part of a basic language is a different thing..  So it can seem that they have abilities to speak far beyond Primates, when it fact its their mimicry ability that is fooling the hearers to an extent."
"I got to listen to a real neat podcast on expanding thought within the deaf community. The TLDR is that as the concept of ""thinking"" expanded in the deaf community (ie more words surrounding the concept) the deaf community was able to criticially think about problems in new ways (younger generations showed complex understanding of word problems that older generations did not).  So perhaps the issue isnt that they are not capable, but that we havent provided them the tools to understand."
It’s not exactly that.   Parrots are smart enough to assume the sounds we, humans, make are meaningful. Why? Because birds, including parrots, make sounds, and those sounds are often meaningful. So they can assume that if we both make sounds, we both probably attach meaning to the sounds. Intelligence recognizes intelligence.   Anyway, once they make this connection they will mimic our sounds. If we give them a reward they will continue to mimic the sounds they hear.  So a parrot will make the sounds that get them what they want. If the sound “hey” gets you to pay attention to it, it will use the sound “hey” to get your attention. If you hold a treat and repeat “kill all humans” until the parrot repeats “kill all humans” and then you give it the treat, it will use the sound “kill all humans” when it wants a treat.   Here’s the thing though: do you consider it speaking if the parrot then first uses the sound “hey” to get your attention, followed by the sound “kill all humans” to tell you it wants a treat? I do. The only reason the sound “kill all humans” means kill all humans to you is because you learned that. The parrot thinks “kill all humans” means “can I have a treat?” because that it what it was led to believe. Don’t believe? Try the same on a 2 year old human. You’ll have them saying “kill all humans” all day long. (*Don’t* actually do this with a 2 year old human.)  The sounds of language are arbitrary, to all species.   In this way, the parrots are not JUST mimicking us, instead they are speaking to us as well as they are able, even if it’s only about as good at it as a baby human. 
"Thats a great analogy.  I have a cousin who is deaf.  I asked her one time ""how she thinks""  She said its almost like typing something out, but it didn't work that way until she got a computer"
It's a simulation of the voice so they give a human simulated voice for comparison.
I.e. Our simulation of the human voice is not very accurate so take our simulation of the chimps voice with a pinch of salt.  Or maybe the human in that clip was just possessed by a goa'uld.
I had a different takeaway. The simulation is just looking at the acoustic properties of the physical structure and modeling how they would vibrate. The fact that the human and monkey simulations sound so similar suggests that the structures are not very different, and that this is not the reason monkeys can't produce speech. It's not really to tell you what a monkey speaking would sound like... that's more editorial sensationalism.
Excellent Minutephysics video explaining exactly this. [Why is the sky dark at night?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxJ4M7tyLRE)     Summary:    * Universe had a beginning so there aren't necessarily stars in every direction * Some of the far away stars light hasn't reached us yet * The really far away stars light is red-shifted towards infrared (not visible to the naked eye) because of the expansion of the universe.   Edit: To add in some points from the comments.    * Yes some of the light from distant stars is blocked by dust and other objects in the way. The dust tends to absorb visible wavelengths and re-emit in the IR range which we can’t see but that wasn’t in the video so I didn’t include it in my summary.     * Inverse-square law for light intensity. Intensity reduces massively over interstellar distances but that doesn’t really help answer the question because every star does this. Multiplied by an infinite number of stars in every direction, suddenly that tiny bit of light from each star adds up and the night sky should be far brighter than it is. For why it isn’t, I refer you back to the video and my original 3 points.
Here's a video with a great explanation of both the parodox and the answer.  https://youtu.be/yQz0VgMNGPQ   The paradox is basically.  1) If the universe is infinite then no matter where you look eventually you will directly see a star.  2) If every point in the night sky directly leads to a star then the entire sky will be as bright as all those stars.   I've seen a lot of responses about light dropping off in intensity based on distance however you have an infinite number of stars so it doesn't really matter how little light each star provides.  The correct answer to this parodox is that the universe is not infinitely old. So light from stars far away from us hasn't had time to reach us.  The expansion of the universe will prevent us from ever having a sky as bright as the sun because most stars will always be too far away for the light to reach us.
Incredibly sad to see that no one has provided the correct answer. While it is true that the red shift from the expansion of the Universe does play a role, it's a minor one, at least at this point in time, and the inverse square law is entirely irrelevant as the amount of stars at some distance grows with the square of that distance, which cancels out the inverse square law of the intensity of the emitted light.  EDIT: For the CMB the expansion of the Universe is the key factor for not lighting up our sky and in that regard /u/Surprisedpotato's answer is correct , but not when it comes to star light as in OP's question.  The real answer to your specific question is time. The Universe has a beginning, a birth. The Big Bang happened a finite time ago so light from distant stars have only had a limited amount of time to travel, which means that light from the furthest reaches of space haven't had time to reach us. And most of the light emitted from the far reaches of space will never reach us, because of the expansion of the Universe, which is why that does play a role but that role will be a bigger, more important one, later on in time.
The existing top comment correctly realises the OP is asking an age old question, that of Olber's paradox. The top comment though goes on to make some mistakes, the first is the solution of the paradox and the second is crossing the CMBR with the paradox which are not related.  The paradox is: If the universe is infinite then in every direction there must be a star. In such a scenario the whole sky would be a uniform brightness, the same brightness as the surface of a star in fact.  The paradox was first resolved long before we knew about the expansion of space, with a finite speed of light and a finite life time for stars there is only so much of the universe that each star can be illuminating at once. Imagine a shell that has a thickness equal to a stars lifetime propagating through the universe at c.  We later learned that not only would an infinite universe not be bright that our universe is not infinite, there is a observation horizon due to it's expansion and a start point 13.7bn years ago. This defeats the entire premise of the paradox where every single line of sight direction intersects with a star.  While you can explain the lack of light from distant stars as being due to redshift, it is answering a question already answered and is being a bit dishonest anyway since, you are going to be caught out in several other aspects of the more classical solution on your way to a more complicated unnecessary solution. For example, if you were to work out the average redshift of each unit solid angle in the sky you would find the sky would be much brighter than it is, and much MUCH brighter than the 2.7K you rattled off.  This 2.7K is where the mistake really lies is in equating the redshift from distant stars to the CMBR. The CMBR was not emitted by stars (which are the subject of the OP and Olber's paradox) but by a global distribution of hot gas circa 380,000 years after the big bang.   The biggest difference here is that the CMBR was in every direction, unlike stellar light which is only where a star is, it was also initially much cooler (<3000K) and importantly this was emitted long before - and therefore much more heavily redshifted - than the light from even the earliest, most distant stars.
"I always thought that our perception of ""lit"" is some kind of brightness per area. And while a star might always emit a constant amount of light, our perceived brightness depends on our distance to it.  Is that wrong?"
Also, interstellar space is not completely void. There are dust particles, gasses, nebulae and other stuff that stops the light, before it reaches earth. Our own atmosphere also does some job.
I'm not quite happy with this answer. While Olber's Paradox is related to OPs question, the simpler and more on-point answer is the inverse-square law: we have a finite number of stars, and their contribution to the light on earth drops of quickly with distance.   The redshift of the cosmic microwave background is also not a sufficient explanation for Olber's Paradox either, and not related to stellar light at all.  
It took a couple of minutes after watching the video but it just clicked in my head - we humans cannot see in infrared. If we could, then the night sky (rather, just the sky) wouldn’t stop us from seeing things.   But the light scatter from the atmosphere would blind us when our half of the earth faced the sun - much like trying to use night vision goggles in the day time.  So, I guess the evolutionary path our eyes took was to see really well when the sun light was scattered by the atmosphere (day time) and not so well when there is no light scatter (night time). Had it been reversed, we would consider night time our day and have to rush to darkness at sunrise because it would blind us. The current way is much better for survival, it seems.  Am I overthinking this?
"Well, no, not really. In the video you linked he says that what you say is the actual answer is not a good one, because it would mean that a wild universe appeared, already big and wide, which is very unlikely. Because if it was a big bang, the stars would not have ""started"" a long distance away from us.  It has more to do with the fact that the waves of radiation coming from stars are stretched (redshifted) by the expansion of the universe, causing light to go lower on the spectrum, to the point where it's not visible anymore, as the top comment pointed."
"That's entirely correct. Imagine you have a ball with a hundred infinitely long ""spears"" sticking out of it. The closer you are to the ball, the more spears will be sticking into you. The ""spears"" are photons from the surface of a star.  Redshifting is only really relevant for stars outside our galaxy due to the large distances it needs to occur, yet the vast majority of the stars we see are in our galaxy."
true, but this doesn't actually resolve the paradox - the gas and dust would heat up, and eventually start glowing with the heat of the sunlight warming it.   All the gas and dust would do is delay and scatter the light from distant stars, not block it. 
I agree, while Olbers paradox is the correct question, not only is SurprisedPotato's answer not really relevant, it's also wrong. His answer is implying that the CMB is redshifted starlight, which is just incorrect. It is redshifted light from leftover radiation from the big bang, before there even were stars.
Also, we evolved to see the range of wavelength of light which our sun outputs the most of, the visible spectrum.
Space-time can expand faster than light. Nothing can move *within* space-time faster than light.
"So basically this analogy says that the higher the concentration of spears (photons) the brighter we perceive the object to be, correct? So does this mean there are a finite amount of photons being emitted from the surface at any one time? And if this is the case, given enough time/distance, will ""gaps"" appear between the photons?"
Thanks for putting this straight. I thought that the visible light would be just blocked, if something is in front of it. But you're right. Stuff would eventually heat up, and start radiating visible light on its own. 
Actually the visible light spectrum is the only wavelengths that can effectively penetrate liquid water and as our ancestors first developed eyes in water we are stuck with eyes that can only see in those wavelengths.  Also only average stars output light in the visible spectrum. Larger stars output in the upper em bandwidth and small stars output mostly radio.
"Correct. [The relationship of light intensity to distance is the inverse square law](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/isql.html).  And yes, there are a finite number of photons being emitted from the surface at any given one time.  > And if this is the case, given enough time/distance, will ""gaps"" appear between the photons?  Yes, at some point you get far enough away that light no longer hits a given spot consistently, and you start seeing gaps in signal detection over time. Sometimes there will be a photon, and sometimes there won't, and the point source will appear to ""blink"" at increasingly long intervals."
Not necessarily visible light, it could reach an equilibrium well below that by starting off radiating infrared light.
An excellent point. We see the wavelengths we do because of the properties of the water we evolved in. Water is opaque to almost all other wavelengths, this is not a coincidence. 
The twinkle comes from the light interacting with particles in our atmosphere.  Some photons are blocked by dust, varying chemical compounds in the air and other things floating around.  But as they're constantly moving, the brightness (amount of photons colliding with your retina) is constantly changing, causing the twinkle effect.
It's not so much particles in the atmosphere as it is geometric distortions from thermal currents and eddies in the atmosphere. You know how the surface of a pool creates caustic effects where there's a pattern of concentrated bright spots and dull spots on the bottom? That's due to refraction from the water surface. Our atmosphere does exactly the same thing to light that passes through it, just to a lesser degree since air is not as dense as water. The twinkling is when the atmosphere has refracted the light from a star in such a way that some of the photons either get spread out, or concentrated.  [You can easily see this distortion effect when looking at the moon through a telescope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9OHHRjtKvk). 
A CPU can only work on stuff in its cache and the RAM of the device (be it PC / Mac / console / mobile / etc). However, such memory is volatile, and loses all its data if it is not powered. To solve this problem, secondary storage exists: hard disk drives, DVD drives, USB disks, flash memory, etc. They hold persistent data that is then transferred to the RAM as and when needed, to be worked on by the CPU.   Now, when a computer boots up, a lot of its core processes and functions are pre loaded into RAM and kept there permanently, for regular usage. (The first of this stuff that loads is known as the *kernel*.) They are also heavily dependent on each other; eg, the input manager talks to the process scheduler and the graphics and memory controllers when you press a button. Because these are so interconnected, shutting one down to update it is not usually possible without breaking the rest of the OS' functionality*.  So how do we update them? By replacing the files *on disk*, not touching anything already in memory, and then rebooting, so that the computer uses the new, updated files from the start.   *In fact, Linux's OS architecture and process handling tackles this modularity so well that it can largely update without a restart.
Windows places locks on files in use.  The reasoning is you don't want to open a file, make changes but not save, and then have something else make changes to the file and save them.  Because when you do save the file, you'll overwrite the changes made by the other process.  So when your computer is on, a lot of system files are locked.  If windows needs to make changes to one in a patch, it'll set a flag and upon reboot, make the change since the file will no longer be in use at that point.
That entirely depends on the system, and what is being updated.  Linux can largely be updated with no restarting required, but that's because it can disable individual sections of the system, update them, then turn them back on.  Windows can't do this, so it needs rebooting for system updates because it can't change files that are in use (typically anyway).  As far as consoles, I'm not sure, since the PS3/4 have a ~~Linux~~ FreeBSD backend so they ***can't*** hot patch, while the Xbox and Nintendo systems I've got no experience with so I can't really say.  I'm sure someone will give a vastly more in depth reason though.  [Edit] Updated as /u/blue_collie pointed out PS3/4 are FreeBSD not Linux backends.
The only correct answer is that it is simply easier to treat the code as immutable, and restart the program whenever you want to change the code. It is more than possible to design systems, even operating systems or other low level programs which don't need to be rebooted in order to update(this concept is called 'hot swapping'), but it is harder to design those systems and sometimes also harder to reason about their correctness. Imagine it this way: Rebooting to update software is like putting a car into a garage and upgrading the engine. Doing a live update is like upgrading your engine while you are going down the highway at 65mph.
To expand upon the answer. The core processes and functions are referred to as the kernel.  Linux processes that are already running during these updates will not be updated until the process is restart.  Also, there are mechanisms to update the kernel while it is running. One example of this is the ksplice project, but writing these patches is non-trivial.  The short answer, is that it's much easier to restart and have the system come up in a known consistent state.
>the PS3/4 have a Linux backend they should be able to do it  I'm pretty sure the Sony consoles use a FreeBSD backend, which doesn't have the hotpatching update mechanism that Linux does.  That's probably why they can't do an online update.
Speaking as a software engineer, this answer makes sense to me.  And rather than building a thing that does live code swapping you'd probably be better off optimizing the reboot.
To expand on this expansion. Not all shutdowns and reboots are strictly necessary just because the computer wants it. They reboot so that it's always a clean boot with a fresh system, not thinking to much about if it would be possible to avoid it. New patch => better reboot asap, its' easier than even starting to think about if the patch really needs it.   A reboot may also be needed not because it's is impossible to patch the system in a way that it doesn't need one, but because it may be extremely difficult to do so reliable.   Take Windows for example, if you install a patch that patches something you don't even use and the computer wants a reboot, it doesn't really need it, it just doesn't decide if it has to. It's always a yes.
Linux handles its processes a bit differently. I believe it loads the entire executable and necessary shared libraries into memory at once, which allows it to be overwritten on disk without any concerns of affecting in-memory applications.  Note that this is speculation and I just woke up, but it sounds logical enough in my head.  **Edit:** 10 seconds of research conform I'm right. :p  **Edit 2:** Or, technically right. Really it relies on the file system, I believe.
> Why is it that Linux allows my to use my OS while updating while requiring no reboot?  It doesn't.  Certain updates DO require a reboot, just as with any other OS. If you want to change your kernel or bootloader, most distributions will require a reboot.  It is possible to replace a running kernel while running, but most distributions don't bother supporting that as a means of updating. It's also still a very good idea to reboot. Why? Because you need to make sure your computer **will** boot. Otherwise when it DOES reboot, it might not come back up cleanly. Better to find and fix now than when a hardware component fails.  Also, updating major software components while running may produce strange results. Some applications load everything they need into memory when they launch, and they will happily carry on even if you pull the binary out from under them. Many applications include dynamic plugins, resource files on disk, configurations, etc. Those applications are not going to do so well when something changes.
You're correct, but bear in mind there are lots of ways of doing this in Linux and Linux-like kernel models. QNX for example is an  operating system commonly used in automotive and since version 7.0 runs a full micro-kernel architecture. This means an entire micro-OS can crash or be updated and then rebooted without affecting critical canbus functions, like your brakes.   *Edit for clarification as another user pointed out my over simplistic explanation. QNX is not just used in cars but in mobile phones (BlackBerry OS), traffic light systems etc etc. The car example really highlights how it can work though.
"It is more than an ""automotive Operating System"". Its first and foremost selling point was/is that it is a Real Time Operating System, as in, it will guaranteed respond to an event in a ~~determinant~~ determinate amount of time."
