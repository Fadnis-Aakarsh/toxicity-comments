72622	0	a	certainly. so bluegrass, in its early form, was not very different from early country. the early form of bluegrass, appalachian dance music, was intended to accompany dancers and dancing competitions, though it evolved to being listened to purely for pleasure. earlier country artists, like uncle dave macon, recorded some songs that sound similar to the early bluegrass sound. although i don't like to point at specific dates as being finite points in a continuous evolution of music, two years and one man stick out to me: 1939, 1945, and bill monroe. bill monroe is considered the father of bluegrass and his heritage (from kentucky, the blue grass state) and his band (the blue grass boys) are the sources for the genre's name. monroe had been a musician for some years before forming the blue grass boys in 1939, who played appalachian folk music. this style was, for its time, pretty old-timey and based on the old string bands that had dominated the early opry and hillbilly charts. so in a way, bluegrass was always at least slightly different from contemporary mainstream county. however, monroe and his band's sound changed sharply in 1945, when monroe discovered banjo player earl scruggs, whose three-finger style wowed audiences and has since become the standard for bluegrass music.  though scruggs left in 1949 with fellow blue grass boy lester flatt to form the foggy mountain boys (whose foggy mountain breakdown you have definitely heard), monroe continued to hire banjo players that played in scruggs' style, and ralph stanley of the stanley brothers, another early bluegrass group, also picked up the three-finger technique. because of monroe's reputation as a tough bandleader, musicians often came and went in the blue grass boys, which had the effect of producing a diaspora of bluegrass musicians that spread the style. it is during this time, 1945-1950, that bluegrass, to me, is no longer old time hillbilly music, and definitely isn't mainstream country, which by this point consisted of the beat-driven honky tonk style (bluegrass is, in contrast, very melodic). i place 1950 as the end of this time because that early to mid 50s were considered to be monroe's, and bluegrass in general's, first golden age.

81f29c543a6ee75b	1	a	choose your loyalties   sir,  it has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate american education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a bangladeshi.  my parents are/were bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people i have ever had the misfortune of knowing; indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that i have been forced to spend in bangladesh due to my father, i am now convinced that bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (i use are/were because, i regret to say, my mother was struck dead by bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, i mourn her loss greatly.)  never have i felt more love for my country than now, when i find myself forced away from it! i have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the united states of america: the greatest country in the world, god bless every inch of it.  but after my experiences with bangladeshis, i cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the united states while offering nothing in return. i implore you to either renounce bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.  sincerely yours,  a proud american

""""it is possible,"""" says the doorkeeper, """"but not at the moment."""" since the gate stands open, as usual, and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man stoops to peer through the gateway into the interior. observing that, the doorkeeper laughs and says: """"if you are so drawn to it, 'just try to go in despite my veto. but take note: i am powerful. and i am only the least of the doorkeepers. from hall to hall there is one doorkeeper after another, each more powerful than the last. the third doorkeeper is already so terrible that even i cannot bear to look at him."""" these are difficulties the man from the country has not expected; the law, he thinks, should surely be accessible at all times and to everyone, but as he now takes a closer look at the doorkeeper in his fur coat, with his big sharp nose and long, thin, black tartar beard, he decides that it is better to wait until he gets permission to enter. the doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at one side of the door. there he sits for days and years. he makes many attempts to be admitted, and wearies the doorkeeper by his importunity. the doorkeeper frequently has little interviews with him, asking him questions about his home and many other things, but the questions are put indifferently, as great lords put them, and always finish with the statement that he cannot be let in yet. the man, who has furnished himself with many things for his journey, sacrifices all he has, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. the doorkeeper accepts everything, but always with the remark: """"i am only taking it to keep you from thinking you have omitted anything."""" during these many years the man fixes his attention almost continuously on the doorkeeper. he forgets the other doorkeepers, and this first one seems to him the sole obstacle preventing access to the law. he curses his bad luck, in his early years boldly and loudly; later, as he grows old, he only grumbles to himself. he becomes childish, and since in his yearlong contemplation of the doorkeeper he has come to know even the fleas in his fur collar, he begs the fleas as well to help him and to change the doorkeeper's mind. at length his eyesight begins to fail, and he does not know whether the world is really darker or whether his eyes are only deceiving him. yet in his darkness he is now aware of a radiance that streams inextinguishably from the gateway of the law. now he has not very long to live. before he dies, all his experiences in these long years gather themselves in his head to one point, a question he has not yet asked the doorkeeper. he waves him nearer, since he can no longer raise his stiffening body. the doorkeeper has to bend low toward him, for the difference in height between them has altered much to the man's disadvantage. """"what do you want to know now?"""" asks the doorkeeper; """"you are insatiable."""" """"everyone strives to reach the law,"""" says the man, """"so how does it happen that for all these many years no one but myself has ever begged for admittance?"""" the doorkeeper recognizes that the man has reached his end, and, to let his failing senses catch the words, roars in his ear: """"no one else could ever be admitted here, since this gate was made only for you. i am now going to shut it.""""

72672	0	a	brilliant write up there.  i must admit that i never gave the spanish civil war much thought within the context of wwii, mainly coming down to the fact that francoist spain didn’t contribute much to the “actual” conflict; probably didn’t help that my teacher in high school planted the conflict within the ‘interwar years’.  perfectly showcases your point in challenging perspectives.  my teacher instead relied on the ‘starting date’ debate to challenge the “eurocentric” perspective (went to school in hong kong); the two dates given were pretty uncontroversial imo, being marco polo bridge and pearl harbor.  if i recall correctly high school me rejected both dates, using lend-lease against pearl harbor in measuring us involvement in the conflict, and that the “chinese theatre” alone can’t justify calling it a ‘world war’.  of course that doesn’t necessarily legitimize 1st september 1939, but i’m cutting high school me some slack, and blame my teacher for only giving me 3 dates to choose from.  your point in national myth-making did get me curious though: did the spanish themselves connect the civil war to the wider global conflict?

52147	0	a	"sexual control has been a tool of power since pretty much the moment stratified societies exist. i recommend reading michel foucault on this, for all his faults, his analysis of how sexuality plays into how power works within society is rather succinct.  basically, after the church had tried to control the way people have sex, when bourgeois republics became influential they even more aggressively used medicine and the new field of psychoanalysis and psychology to regulate sexuality. this was when a lot of things happened, you weren't just a man who had sinned by sleeping with a man, for example, but suddenly you were identified by this ""perversion"" which was seen as something deeply part of your very identity which had to be ""cured"".  at the center of it all was the myth of a healthy societal body. just as absolute monarchy had the image of the monarch, whose body and mind had to be perfected as an image to represent the state, a republican state had to regulate, discipline and perfect this societal body. add to this the constant eat-or-be-eaten dynamic of capitalism which arose at that time, and you have a quite sinister dynamic, which had birthed eugenics and genocide on a level that hadn't really existed before - at least not in this sophisticated way.  the basic dynamic has persisted to this day, even though it has of course also evolved. one example slavoj zizek brings up was when he was reading an in-flight magazine once, which had an article praising sex - mind you not for pleasure - but because ""it is good for you"", healthy, burns calories, etc. , thus also regulating the way we are having sex and delegating it to the societal imperative to perfect yourself to be as healthy and productive as possible."

74405	0	a	"i'm not op, but i've been with the love of my life for 11 years, living together for 8 of those years, and i love them more now than i probably did when all of this began.   so... one of my biggest pieces of advice is you need to let that person be your best friend. it's the two of you against the world, so let them in like your confidante and be stupid with them. you have to be your truest self, not who you think they want, and if they let you be that person and love you, you've found someone golden.   also, you have to trust that person. trust is earned, but once it is earned... let them be free. the person you love is a whole other individual with wants and needs, just like you, and you have to communicate with them and make sure they're fulfilled and happy and ok with where they are. let them go out with friends without looking through their phone, or demanding to know when they'll be home. give them space and allow them to be them without being up their ass all the time and trying to insert yourself in every part of their life. trust them.  you must also be generous with your partner. i'm not talking big things like gifts and money... i'm talking little things, like taking care of them really well when they're sick. rubbing their back when they're tired. giving them support after a long day... always being ready to negotiate and compromise. this is, of course, a two-way street. you don't do these things all yourself. the both of you do this together.   but i think the most important and hardest thing to learn is effective communication. you will get pissed at each other. no one can hurt you like the one you love the most, and when they do, holy shit does it hurt and make you furious. it can be over something really small and stupid, but goddamn you can get mad, especially after many years together if it's a repeat offense or pet peeve. this type of shit can tear people apart, people who have loved each other for a long time... there is a kind of way to... remove yourself from the emotions of the situation, swallow your pride, explain to your partner why you are upset, talk about it fairly and calmly as best you can, and then move on. this is hard because it requires both people to be able to talk and communicate even when upset. sometimes you need to take a break before you can talk, and that's ok... but don't be petty, don't hold a stupid grudge, and don't go to bed angry. and even if you feel like you're in the right, they might reveal something you did that hurt them too. you can't act like it's a me-vs-them power trip. you have to be able to say, ""you're right. i'm sorry. that was wrong."" talk to your loved one. if they are worth it, they will talk to you too, no matter the stress of the situation. it is important to remember things like ""i love this person"" even when you're super pissed. also, both of you have to know and allow that sometimes people say things they don't mean. i'm not talking abusive, horrible shit... but in any fight, hurtful things get said. forgive each other. hug each other. snuggle and watch a movie and remember all the reasons you love each other after those moments. this is one of the hardest things. sometimes you have to be the bigger person and swallow your pride. it's worth it, because when that person loves you, they will reciprocate and it will be ok in the end.   one final thing-- they say opposites attract, and i think it's true about personalities, because my love and i have different personalities that ""balance"" each other out. for example, i'm very shy and he's not, so he encourages me out of my comfort zone. i'm very methodic and thoughtful with my preparations, he likes to charge in and do things like a bull in a china shop, so i slow him down and help balance him that way... but... i think it's so important to have things in common. we share a lot of favorite movies, tv shows, music, etc. and in that way we are really like best friends getting excited about the same things. going on road trips and enjoying music together (we take turns, we don't love all the same music, just some). it is work and balance and compromise.   it is a choice to love someone through thick and thin. when they are at their worst, you have to choose to help them through and see past it, and them for you. this whole ""if you love someone, it should be easy, this shouldn't happen, blah blah blah"" that's all crap. that's all rom-com bullshit. it is not easy, but it is absolutely worth it and amazing and wonderful if you choose to put the work in, to swallow your pride, to compromise, to support, etc.   i hope this helps in some way. remember, all of this advice is not one-sided. you must do these things, and so must they. also, the advice about ""seeing someone at their worst"" i.e... stuck in traffic, losing their car keys, losing their patience over something small... you need to see those sides of someone in order to know if you can  really love all of this person, good and bad. no masks, no acts.

56519	0	a	honestly this is wonderful news. however, as someone who has worked extensively with people with psychiatric, mood disorders, and tbi patients, a large portion of the homeless population have some form mental health problem.  i know it's easy to characterise homelessness and a lack of job as laziness, but in many cases it is not.  the problem with this program is that it does not account for mental health disorders. those individuals will not be able to participate in these programs.  currently, there is this perception that homeless people can get out of their situation simply if they tried harder. if they get their shit together, get a job and stopped being lazy, they can afford housing. however, in many instances  of homelessness, there is a medical/psychiatric/psychological condition that needs to be treated. in these cases, homelessness is a consequence of their condition, not a character flaw.   don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful program and will help many people. however, don't be surprised if  you still homeless people around.

75832	0	a	the first time we realized she was eating thread off of the spool, that was pretty memorable.. i’m older and was in college when the tv series friends started. we were also a couple years in so we had our own house off campus. we were sitting around with our housemates and friends from the house across the street (this will be important in a moment) watching a new episode - we all heard little saliva noises and the whole room slowly turned to look at her (people were on couches, on the floor, but she was in the lounger at the back corner of the room) and she has this piece of black thread coming out of her mouth down to her lap, to the spool!? and she very nonchalantly reached down and broke the thread with her fingers while everyone was silently glaring at her, and then proceeded to shove the rest of the thread into her mouth! we were all drinking and stoned so it was hilarious and the room broke out with laughter and confusion and questions, she responded with a funny “get off my back” kinda way. we didn’t think anything of it, we all knew her for two year and knew she was ... “creative.” but unanimously our favorite act of bonkers was when we were doing a coat drive for the middle school near where we lived off campus. our housemates and neighbor friends got old coats from home over break and we had them all in boxes in our living room. another housemate and i took the boxes to donate that weekend and when dropping them off the woman there asked us if our kids had grown out of them, we were like “no, these were our when we were kids, just donating...” then she asked something that didn’t relate to her fist question but also didn’t make any sense as a .... she asked “why did you cut the elastic cuffs off all these jackets?”. (it’s important to mention that in the early 90s elastic cuffs on jackets were a thing.) she took the donation,but, it was immediate. i knew, my neighbor i think knew right away. we went back and asked.. she said that the thread that makes the cuffs on old jackets is salty. if she wasn’t so damn wacky fun other than her.. being a weirdo... i would have thought she was a serial killer.  edit: i’d like to add the one of the more memorable parts of that was all the weeks after this being all, “i cannot believe she ate 16 jacket cuffs.” amongst our friends... something you never expect to say.

691e28926ef53e13	0	a	"""it's really very difficult to let you down gently, because i find myself accused by you of edit warring which i totally reject. i understand that you might be doing it to pacify tiamut but it’s unfair to do it at my expense. if i should speak softly then the above wrong image of me might stick in someone’s mind, which is unfair to me. this version that you are reading is a toned down version of the original. if i still hurt you (hg), then i apologize, as my intention is only to clear a wrong image of me in your mind and by extension in the mind of others.  i'm sorry to say, but you're totally off base. i'll take it that you haven't followed the sequence of events and are totally unaware of who edited what. if you would have checked out the exact sequence of events you couldn't have come to such conclusions and made such comments.  frankly, i am very disappointed in you trying to equate us. while my reputation is unblemished and everyone who has followed me here knows that i'm here to add my knowledge on jewish subjects for which i have barely scratched the surface, and although i am bold,  i go out of my way to be fair and uphold the neutrality of wikipedia. tiamut on the other hand has one agenda, and one agenda only; to push a palestinian pov. i'm sorry to say, but your trying to put her in a good light rings hollow. please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. sorry i cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us. by equating us you are actually smearing my character and exonerating her which is really not fair. it seems to me that she cannot do any bad and i cannot do very much good; that's the impression i get from your comments.  here are some things you say which i find incorrect or disturbing. the reason i am calm is because i have given up on her, given up on the mediators, and almost given up on wikipedia. only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. i'll talk straight and pull no punches. i made my comment on your page only to show you that tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; i know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then i'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. i have no softer way of putting it, that i just can't take this crap that tiamut thought it reasonable to add """"nation"""" to the opening paragraph. no, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. while tiamut has lost her temper many times; i haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. you say that you're surprised that tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; i wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. you say that i started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of pov pushing. my purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which i have already given up. my purpose is to point out her pov pushing to all of you. actually i think that i'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. lastly i completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. when one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. please get it straight; i am an honest editor and she is a pov pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. she needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.  her response to you is a game which allows her to do what she wants while she is engages in dilly-dallying and in false placation. tiamut has learned to play a game with all of you. she pretends to engage in discussion but in reality does what she wants and then has the audacity to reverse the sequence of events to make it look as if she thought she was doing the right thing. now watch her threaten that she will report me; that's also part of her game, and if she succeeds then wikipedia doesn’t deserve any better.     it's time to call a spade a spade; because otherwise wikipedia will lose its valuable editors and stay with the crap. i’m really fed up with wikipedia, and ready to bid everyone farewell.

5f2844ef7e576b18	0	a	"""  ernie smith writes   Æµ§œš¹ i attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of user hoary i have been blocked by the wikipedia administrators.  that said, you should carefully examine what i did in fact state regading the four ways that baugh posits as being the afrocentric proponent's view on ebonics.  i maintain that just because a writer happens to be black or african american (weddington, baugh and green for example) being black does not make their postion on ebonics afrocentric.  what i stated was that; """"the proponents of the term ebonics view and use the word ebonics only one way.  that way being; from an africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.""""  i went on to state that """"in fact, a careful analysis of what baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not afrocentric at all.  that is, the view that ebonics “is the equivalent of black english and is considered to be a dialect of english"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for african american vernacular english|aave” is eurocentric.  the other three views, numbers (i), (ii) and (iv), are afrocentric...""""   Æµ§œš¹, if you re-read the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what i stated concerning baughs number (ii).  so let me make it clear here. it is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; """"to refer to the languages of the african diaspora as a whole”, is definitely afrocentric.  what i questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of english language|english: either”.  i contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron.  the fact that eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word ebonics to """"refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of english language"""" does not make this practice afrocentric.  to user:desiegel  i am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. in fact i co-authored a book on the origin of the """"n' word and in that book i extensivly addressed how the meaning of the kemetic (egyptian)word ngr has changed.  in this book shaba shebaka and i systematically demonstrate that while all english language dictionaries posit the origin of the 'n' word as being derived from the latin word 'niger' meaning 'black', (see ullaman, et.al. third latin book (1930:51) the word 'niger' is not originally a latin word. (see america heritage dictionary (1976:1531) that is, while the word 'niger' may have entered into the english langange from latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant mdw ntr 'ngr' is found in the ancient kemetic (egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a latin civilization.  the empirical evidence is that the root word ngr was introduced to the ayran or european people when they initially invaded and made contact with the negroid people (ngrs) of ancient india around 2000-1000 bc. (see wallbank and taylor(1942:72,73)and durant (1954:356).  in sir e.a. wallis budge's egypitian hieroglyphic dictionary the words ngrs and nggr can be found in hieroglyphs.  budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in egypt today.  as defined by budge the first word ngrs is the name of an ancient kemetic or egyptian god (budge 1978:341).  the second word nggr is the name of an ancient kemitic or egyptian goddess (budge 1978:398).  for the wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the 'n' word to ebonics i strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word """"ebony"""" in any unabridged english language dictionary. the point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged.  einar haugen states the point i am making thusly:  """"if we call the building-up of a language an aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an umbau.  this is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?""""  of course to those who view ebonics as being a dialect of english the idea of 'biligualism' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved niger-congo africans in diappora is unfathomable.          referneces  budge wallis e.a.

57457	0	a	thanks man, i do like to write, but it's easy to describe it when it's such a visceral experience. you can feel like you're there because i *was* there, and being there is special.  there's just something special about that day. maybe it's how the city swells with people from literally all over the world. maybe it's because you know your buddies in nyc and philly and la all have to work that day. maybe it's because it's one of the few times a bloody mary at 8:45am on a monday in april doesn't make you an alcoholic, it makes you 45 mins behind schedule.  but the city *feels* like something.  the best marathon monday was the year after the bombings. there was something like fifteen or twenty thousand more runners that year because they allowed everyone who didn't get to finished the year before to re-run. and everyone was running for something, and running more than proving something to themselves, they were running against not just their own fear, but fear itself.  i went to the sox game with my buddies that day, as is tradition.  and it was just gorgeous out.  like every year, the big screen at fenway has a small sidebar that shows the standings in the marathon for everyone at the game to follow. the kenyans were all among the top, as they always are. but in first was an eritrean named meb, who was an american citizen running with the american flag next to his name. they kept flashing to him and the stadium cheered.  an american of any stripe hasn't won the boston marathon in what, thirty years? what are the ods. let's stay focused on the game guys.   but he's not falling back.  and then the big screen cuts the game to meb turning right onto hereford st, and then left onto boylston. the final stretch. lined by buildings and crowds. i wouldn't be surprised if fenway could hear the crowd on boylston, and boylston could hear everyone at the sox game cheering.  i don't even think the umps called a time out in the game, everyone just stopped and watched.   the batter put his bat down, the center fielder turned to the screen and watched with his glove on his hip.  and goddamnit, meb did it. that sand bagging sonofabitch. we watched as they placed the laurel wreath on his head and he wrapped himself in an american flag and cried. we all cried. ever look around and smile at people without saying anything? it was that.  high fives, usa chants, goosebumps, and smiles.  a year after boston was a war zone it was soo full of love.  i don't even remember the final score, but goddamn i love that holiday.

65782	0	a	"no, it is not.  phones and other devices that broadcast (tablets, laptops, you name it ...) emit electromagnetic (em) radiation. em radiation comes in many different forms, but it is typically characterized by its frequency (or wavelength, the two are directly connected).  most mobile devices communicate with em signals in the frequency range running from a few hundred megahertz (mhz) to a few gigahertz (ghz).  so what happens when we're hit with em radiation? well, it depends on the frequency. the frequency of the radiation determines the energy of the individual photons that make up the radiation. higher frequency = higher energy photons. if photons have sufficiently high energy, they can damage a molecule and, by extension, a cell in your body. there's no exact frequency threshold from which point on em radiation can cause damage in this way, but 1 petahertz (phz, or 1,000,000 ghz) is a good rough estimate. for photons that don't have this much energy, the most they can hope to achieve is to see their energy converted into heat.  converting em radiation into a heat is the #1 activity of a very popular kitchen appliance: the microwave oven. this device emits em radiation with a frequency of about 2.4 ghz to heat your milk and burn your noodles (while leaving parts of the meal suspiciously cold).  the attentive reader should now say to themselves: wait a minute! this 2.4 ghz of the microwave oven is right there between the ""few hundred mhz"" and ""few ghz"" frequency range of our mobile devices. so are our devices mini-microwave ovens?  as it turns out, 2.4 ghz is also the frequency used by many wifi routers (and devices connecting to them) (which coincidentally is the reason why poorly shielded microwave ovens can cause dropped wifi connections when active). but this is where the second important variable that determines the effects of em radiation comes into play: intensity.  a microwave oven operates with a power of somewhere around the 1,000 w (depending on the model), whereas a router has a broadcast power that is limited (by law, in most countries) to 0.1 w. that makes a microwave oven 10,000 more powerful than a wifi router at maximum output. and mobile devices typically broadcast at even lower intensities, to conserve battery. and while microwave ovens are designed to focus their radiation on a small volume in the interior of the oven, routers and mobile devices throw their radiation out in every direction.  so, not only is em radiation emitted by our devices not energetic enough to cause direct damage, the intensity with which it is emitted is orders of magnitude lower to cause any noticeable heating.  but to close, i would like to discuss one more source of em radiation. a source from which we receive radiation with frequencies ranging from 100 terahertz (thz) to 1 phz or even slightly more. yes, that overlaps with the range of potentially damaging radiation. and even more, the intensity of this radiation varies, but can reach up to tens of w. that's not the total emitted, but the total that directly reaches a human being. not quite microwave oven level, but enough to make you feel much hotter when exposed to it.  so what is this source of em radiation and why isn't it banned yet? the source is none other than the sun. (and it's probably not yet banned due to the powerful agricultural lobby.) our sun blasts us with radiation that is far more energetic (to the point where it can be damaging) than anything our devices produce and with far greater intensity. even indoors, behind a window, you'll receive so much more energy from the sun (directly or indirectly when reflected by the sky or various objects) than you do from the ensemble of our mobile devices."

d74a030a4a71cb51	0	a	dennis stamp article i see that you deleted this article back in september.  how do i go about bringing it back to life?  dennis was actually a fairly notable wrestler in texas and florida in the 70's.  he held numerous (10) n.w.a. championships and was even featured in sylvester stallone's movie paradise alley in 1978.  because of his somewhat dubious appearance in beyond the mat in the late 90's he has gained a bad rap as fancruft, but i think he is really a valid notable part of wrestling history from the 70's in the south.  please advise.  thanks.

(see ousd resolution page 1. para. 5.)  as further evidence that the ousd board's resolution was about """"ebonics"""", """"pan african communication behaviors"""" or """"african language systems"""" and not african american vernacular english, i cite the fact that first ‘now therefore be it resolved’ clause of the ousd resolution states: “now therefore be it resolved the board of education officially recognizes the existence of, and cultural and linguistic bases of west and niger -congo african languages systems and these are the language patterns that many african american students bring to school;”  clearly based on this passage of the resolution what the ousd board was addressing was the existence of  """"ebonics"""", """"pan african communication behaviors"""" or """"african language systems"""" and not african american vernacular english.   the second “therefore be it resolved” clause of the ousd resolution states:  “be it resolved that the board of educ"

daff1f1e072b462b	0	a	yes, very interesting anecdote.   as far as i can see the word 'flapper' was originally british slang and from another origin, but it's possible that when the word spread to america folk etymology quickly came up with an explanation for it connected with the fashion for wearing galoshes unbuckled.  this association must have happened early on, as the 1928 film 'bare knees' mentioned above seems already to reflect it. could you add some dates to your anecdote, and tell us roughly when your grandmother was wearing this fashion?  beyondmyken is right, this is original research and we shouldn't add it to the article, but it could help explain where the 'galoshes' theory for the origin of 'flapper' came from.

6740fa599d2180ce	0	a	, 23 september 2012 (utc) i just wanted to say that professional doctors in brazil often use it along traditional western health care (generally after, prescribing together with allopathic treatment, never as medicine). there is an idea here of people of using it in the same way a vaccine could do good i.e. that thing i mentioned earlier with my experience, a really great quantity (in terms of homoeopathy, that is nearly nothing – that former doctor of mine explained the most common homoeopathy to my mother using the joke of the comparison to seawater) of dead ill-bearing beings together with herbal medicine. but i think no sane person would qualify it as cure anywhere, even in the limited demographics that homoeopathy, to say, can improve 5-20% of their immune system functioning (but all immune systems are different because every human is a universe, perhaps in most people something so light that is reason of mockery such as hpthy is likely worthless). alternative medicine approach is not something to trust (much less alone) in case of death-threatening diseases – in the immune system example, homoeopathy would be used in light to mid allergies such as the source of my rhinitis, with a grain of salt in more serious conditions (together with traditional treatment – like what cured me from chronic sinusitis and otitis, and i attribute it more to the non-homoeopathic treatment), but i don't expect an effect at all with auto-immune conditions. if someone offers it as medicine, it is obviously quackery, but i think that the point of mkweise is not how homoeopathy can kill by the ignorance of some users and/or shamelessness of quackers, but how it is said to not work in every situation, with nobody, and all scientific research adequately using methods of demonstrating it, what millions of people that are not necessarily ignorant (including 3 former doctors that saved my life that hadn't no profit with the so-called quackery) would disagree to. but i don't have sources to reivindicate my claims unlike the other side, so i will neither change content nor ask someone to do it.   22:10

56465	0	a	"i had to spend 3 days for driving on a suspended.  (unpaid ticket)  i was supposed to be out the next day but they didn't book me.for 24 hours and they don't do court every day sp.i had to wait.  never got my phone call either...  anyway, i am not proud to admit that i cried (not much, just the quite tear type) after i found out i wasn't leaving as soon as i thought.  not for myself,  i can sleep on concrete np, but because my 4 month old was with my grandparents and i didn't know who was going to care for him beyond that first night and they were out of formula. i was terrified. i couldn't get a call to let anyone know what was going on and i was worried for my kids.    those girls were awesome.  they made me feel better and encouraged me the entire time. there was some drama between the regulars but nothing outside of high school type rumors and name calling.    i felt so bad, the night before i left, a whoe cell of people (about 15 people since they were overcrowded.  they had people sleeping under the bunks) was put in the drunk tank with us for a night and a day because they tore up the toilet.  they were pretty chill.  they joked that they didn't think that far ahead in their plan.  the whole time i was there, i saw a lot of the guards be assholes to the inmates and after one dick made us wait 6 hours for tp and pads because we were banging on the doors too much (to get their attention for more tp and pads) one of the women from the evacuated cell turned to me and said ""i know it wasn't a great thing to do, but now do you understand why we do things like rip up the toilet?"" and i did.      they were ignored for hours, days if you dont count meal times, and if the guards had to a knowledge them for anything, even for basic hygiene items, they were punished in some way.  2 of my 3 nights there, a woman with a seizure disorder was in the drunk tank with me and she seized 2 or 3 dozen times before she was sent to the hospital, they kept fearing she was faking.....  for hours.  the jail nurse kept coming in with smelling salts and used them as a treatment, leaving when she stopped seizing.  the poor girl didn't even regain consciousness, they just left when she stopped thrashing.  we had to hold her head to make sure she didn't bash it on the concrete.  the reason for all the seizures?  she had been there for 5 days.  you can't get meds prescribed to you without seeing the nurse and they hadn't let her see the nurse yet (hell she was still in the drunk tank after 5 days) so she had been 5 days without her seizure meds. she almost died when she went into one while we were sleeping and cracked her head on the floor before we could restrain her.  blood was everywhere.     another woman was pregnant, early on, and started cramping.  it took them 7 hours to get her to the hospital and they were barley able to stop the contractions.  they said if it happened again and she didn't get something done quick, she would lose the baby.    now i'm not saying cos are bad people, this was just a county jail in a good ole boy town.  my husband's friend he had when he was in the national guard got a job at this jail and didn't last 2 months because of the curroption.  there were a couple of guards that were nice people, 2 guys and 3 women.    best part?  the reason me, or any of the other women that got arrested couldn't get our phone calls was because it was a man's jail and we couldn't be out when men were on the floor.  problem was the men were the trustees, the people that cleaned the jail and did chores.  they were always out.  the phones were in the booking area.  when i kept asking for my call, the female guards really did try but the last time i asked, the captain? told her that the men come first.  that surprised me.  i figured any sexism that went on would be covert, but they were completely open about it.    no one ever got one.  i was lucky my husband was calling the jail every day and got me bail without me yelling him what he would have to do.  even so, they lied to him multiple times and told him my bail was denied because he kept calling and bothering them when they gave him the run around.    sorry, i went on a rant, but it really pissed me off.  not because of what happened to me, but because i never would have known how bad it was here if i never forgot to pay that speeding ticket.  or if i checked my mail to know my licence was suspended.  and most other people don't know.  i don't expect anyone to read this far but if they do, be careful.  if you are ever arrested for anything, no matter how trivial, your life is in their hands.

65973	0	a	well like many industrial processes there are some fairly nasty chemicals involved, so to an extent we're relying on good regulation. there have been a few cases in china where various toxic spills have occurred from solar plants (e.g. see [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/ar2008030802595.html?referrer=emailarticle)).   there are also some issues with specific types of solar power, e.g. cdte cells or cigs cells, which contain cadmium. as you probably know, cd is very toxic. there's currently a lot of work going on to eliminate cd from all consumer equipment, so this should be solved in time.  in context though, it's important to remember that all of these impacts tend to be minimal compared to the environmental and health implications of coal power. so as long as we're replacing coal, it's still easily a benefit. and, of course, solar isn't much different to many other high tech industries, so it's not like the issues i mentioned above are uniquely problematic.  edit: a few people below are correctly pointing out that cigs is copper-indium-gallium-selenium. however, normally there is cadmium in the buffer layer. there are basically 4 layers: molybdenum -> cigs -> cadmium sulphide -> doped zinc oxide.

(i didn't know at that time that they should always be at least two). and a few weeks after i went to the same pet store to buy feed for him, and noticed that one was left of the same herd i bought from (i have no idea if you even call it a herd, but i'm visiting english and so it is) anyway, i took that last one with me too. and took him home and put hum down on the floor next to that other one. and after just a few seconds they recognized each other and started screaming with joy, they snuggled, and played and started patrolling together. and slept together every night back to back. after two years i found one dead. the other was never himself and died three months later. i never had guinea pigs after that. just writing this makes me so incredibly sad.

72467	0	a	>talondearg's answer does not mention paul's letters,  it does:  >>then you should factor in how you account for other early christian literature, including the other nt documents, and documents written shortly after, for example papias, quoted later in eusebius’ ecclesiastical history, claims to have directly inquired about the apostles’ teaching, and so is about a 3rd generation source. **in regards to the other nt documents, most scholars date the earliest of paul’s letters to the early 50s.** so you must account for the origin of christian communities through asia minor and greece before the 50s.

7ad25caa4478ded9	0	a	i have just spoken with mr. pettersen via phone and have sent all of the remarks from '''''' to him online. he, first and foremost, wants to greatly thank   for their kindness in the matter, and also said that dgg made up outrageous lies. he is greatly concerned that dgg is an editor, as some of his remarks were so grammatically incorrect on talk pages. he can also confirm that he has not been involved in any sort of blogging on bullying and he can also confirm that he has never been an author. mr. pettersen would also like to know if there is a more senior administrator that he can bring the matter up with, as dgg has been so extremely disrespectful. we can completely confirm that the past articles about david pettersen were never about the david pettersen that is currently running for school board.   here is one of our talks...does this seem respectful?:  me: hi, would we still be able to receive his old articles posted in the past, and the one that was just posted yesterday? we were wondering if we could receive and retain those records for review. thank you for your time.  dgg: not in this case. now or ever. your talk p. has the explanation: you are either engaging in advertisement or harassment. btw, you may not under any circumstances remove something from another person's talk page.   is that the way an editor should talk to a new wikipedia user?

51875	0	a	the [full research article](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v544/n7651/full/nature22065.html) was published in the journal *nature*.  **abstract** the earliest dispersal of humans into north america is a contentious subject, and proposed early sites are required to meet the following criteria for acceptance: (1) archaeological evidence is found in a clearly defined and undisturbed geologic context; (2) age is determined by reliable radiometric dating; (3) multiple lines of evidence from interdisciplinary studies provide consistent results; and (4) unquestionable artefacts are found in primary context1, 2. here we describe the cerutti mastodon (cm) site, an archaeological site from the early late pleistocene epoch, where in situ hammerstones and stone anvils occur in spatio-temporal association with fragmentary remains of a single mastodon (mammut americanum). the cm site contains spiral-fractured bone and molar fragments, indicating that breakage occured while fresh. several of these fragments also preserve evidence of percussion. the occurrence and distribution of bone, molar and stone refits suggest that breakage occurred at the site of burial. five large cobbles (hammerstones and anvils) in the cm bone bed display use-wear and impact marks, and are hydraulically anomalous relative to the low-energy context of the enclosing sandy silt stratum. 230th/u radiometric analysis of multiple bone specimens using diffusion–adsorption–decay dating models indicates a burial date of 130.7 ± 9.4 thousand years ago. these findings confirm the presence of an unidentified species of homo at the cm site during the last interglacial period (mis 5e; early late pleistocene), indicating that humans with manual dexterity and the experiential knowledge to use hammerstones and anvils processed mastodon limb bones for marrow extraction and/or raw material for tool production. systematic proboscidean bone reduction, evident at the cm site, fits within a broader pattern of palaeolithic bone percussion technology in africa3, 4, 5, 6, eurasia7, 8, 9 and north america10, 11, 12. the cm site is, to our knowledge, the oldest in situ, well-documented archaeological site in north america and, as such, substantially revises the timing of arrival of homo into the americas.

""""gaza massacre"""" has been disputed as a title with the sources mirroring its forced use on wikipedia hamas did not have an official name for it. this has been discussed and it is a point conceded by those in favor of inclusion. hamas simply did not use its limited pr capabilities to clearly lay this out as their preferred title (see point 1). but back to my point of keeping this open. i have offered two solutions. nableezy has rejected at leas one of them.  include """"it has been called a massacre"""". no bold. not an alternative title. just simply lay it out there. one editor recently provided a source calling it """"massacre in gaza"""". it was obviously referred to as a massacre.  or include every title that was verifiably used in rs at a ratio of tens of thousands to one. this could be accomplished by actually adding information in the lead about the media and its relation t this topic. this would increase the quality of the article by meeting wp:lead] by being an actual summary.  i'm not going to lie, i think it is time to change the title of this article altogether.  notice that other language's wikipedia projects refer to it as the israeli operational name (some editors have equated this to pov even though it is a very common and accurate title) or one laying out the dates and calling it a conflict (as we used to do but it was really long). that discussion will eventually come up again and any decision here will get scuttled by it (or the opposite). but it is clear that giving prominence to a very little used and pov dripping title in the lead is not acceptable to many editors without thoughtful balancing. two easy options are presented to you. it is my hope that the word massacre is used in the lead but how to do it is a hurdle. and add on top of that that we still don't even have a good main title and it shows that this process has been broken since day 1. day 1 was years ago.  03:16, 28"""

73200	0	a	"i work in drug discovery and just want people to understand what they actually did and not be misled by the sensationalized title.  in this paper the authors show the biosynthetic pathway for cannflavins a and b, which describes the enzymes with which the cannabis plant makes these compounds.  they do not discover anything new about the *activity* of these compounds in humans. the claim in the title that cannflavins are ""30 times more powerful than aspirin"" was actually from a paper in 1985 (source: m.l. barrett, d. gordon, f.j. evans. isolation from cannabis sativa l. of cannflavin--a novel inhibitor of prostaglandin production biochem. pharmacol., 34 (1985), pp. 2019-2024).   in this article, they used a single type of human cells (cultured synovial cells from the joint) and look at a single type of inflammatory marker (pge2) and conclude that cannflavin works better than aspirin by a factor of 30, but also works worse than some other drugs that we have (indomethacin by 18x, dexamethasone by over 100x).  so, although the new research is very interesting in an academic sense, it's not really correct to make any kind of comment on how this compound can be a new or better anti-inflammatory based on such little preliminary data from 35 years ago. of note, if we were to discover that the cannflavins had interesting drug-like properties in humans, we would not be using the pathway described in this paper to make it, but rather more efficient organic syntheses that we have at our disposal.  edit: thanks for the awards. i'm getting a lot of similar replies so i wanted to clarify a couple of things:  1) regarding the experiment from 1985, i was just pointing out that when you compare 4 things in a study, the conclusion in the news article shouldn't be ""look at how much better #3 was compared to #4"" without mentioning #1 and 2. i'm not peddling indomethacin or dexamethasone; just highlighting that the experiment gives far too little data to say that any of these are better than the others for human use.  2) cannflavins represent two out of potentially thousands of biologically active compounds in cannabis, if not more. for those of you who have had positive experiences with cannabis, there are many other molecules that can be studied to validate your experiences, even if this is not the one. like many of you, i'm looking forward to future experiments in the field."

14eaec601cbece58	0	a	"""  i agree fully.  there's nothing inherently pejorative about the term.  """"redskin"""" and """"pale face"""" even enjoy a certain amount use as terms of affection between the two races.  i imagine that there are some native americans who dislike the term (just as some, maybe even more understandably, hate the word """"indian""""), just as there are some who find the terms white, black, and yellow offensive.  (though """"yellow"""" is probably a special case, since it is sometimes associated with cowardice, there are still some contexts in which few if any people would be offended by it, such as in """"all people, whether white, black, red, or yellow, should be treated equally"""", in which the usage is very explicitly non-derogatory.)  although, this may depend on the area or the individuals involved.  for example, a native american would probably not be offended by being called a  """"redskin"""" by a white friend who he knows to be anything but a racist, but might strongly object to being called a """"redskin"""" by a member of the kkk.  likewise, in areas where native americans are the largest racial """"minority"""", there has probably already been a long history of mutual cooperation and friendship between the whites and """"redskins"""" of the area (and many whites who very proudly boast a native herritage), who would not immediately think any word was intended pejoratively unless given good reason to do so.  i know in my area, where racism against mexicans and asians is somewhat common (and sadly, even expected), the idea of racism against natives is strange and alien, since the whites and the redskins here have such a long history together and such a strong respect for one another.  although that might also have to do with the fact that most of the cities in my area were founded by scottish and irish immigrants who were treated as outcasts in the rest of the u.s., so the whites who settled here in the early years knew first-hand how hurtful prejudices and stereotypes could be.  in any event, it's not really accurate (and more than a little ignorant) to say that the word """"redskin"""" is a pejorative, when it is clearly not an offensive word in all contexts, and may even be, as mentioned above, a term of as a term of affection.  00:01, august 16, 2005 (utc)"""

(1998). the southern appalachians: a history of the landscape (vol. 18). diane publishing.  davis, d. e. (2011). where there are mountains: an environmental history of the southern appalachians. university of georgia press.  **personal experience**: one of my great-grandfather's was what would today be called a subsistence farmer in buchanan co., va. he cut wood, had dairy cows (so we had our own milk and butter), and famously went to ""the big city"" of tazewell, va a couple times a year for the two ""necessities"" he couldn't provide himself: coffee and salt. he, my great-grandmother (who was native american), and most of us great-grandchildren would regularly forage for food in the forest: poke, ramps, morels, blackberries, huckleberries, juneberries (*amelanchier* spp.), wintergreen berries, persimmons, pawpaw (*asimina triloba*), spicebush, and various nuts were the most common of the plants.  our favorite foraged meal was of morels and perch roe scrambled with chicken eggs. every spring and still probably my favorite meal. perch are anadromous, but don't make it to the appalachians any longer. we'd travel down to fish for them around richmond, va when they were coming up the rivers in the spring."

58244	0	a	from experience i would say that very, very few are unqualified at all - the training is very rigorous and only people who are passionate and good at it stay on to actually get on the phones unsupervised.  the unfortunate fact is that lifeline is run by volunteers who routinely have to face some pretty dreadful working conditions. yes, there are individuals who call imminently suicidal, and lifeline workers are trained to help these people. these are in fact few and far between (i would estimate somewhere around one to three calls per year). lifeline has become a de facto generic mental health help line, rather than exclusively suicide prevention, and the result is that quite a number of calls you take are from people needing to vent, hear some reassurance or get access to services. these are the good calls where you actually feel you’re connecting and helping someone, but at the same time lifeline is limited in resources, and providing 100% free counselling over the phone encourages some callers to rely on it, depriving people imminently in danger (e.g. suicide, psychotic episodes, domestic violence) from being able to reach the service. so time is precious, and typically lifeline workers aim to hear these people out, help, but more importantly direct them to local services better equipped to support them.  but then there’s the bad calls. you get a lot of these. alcoholics who ring repeatedly spouting torrents of abuse towards to you. delusional people who just cannot be helped, but who you worry about. people who have had bad experiences with lifeline in the past and take it out on you. prank calls are an unfortunately frequent occurrence. it’s rough. and if you’re a woman, you get sex calls shockingly often - people who pretend to be having a rough time, wanting to hear you speak in a soft, comforting voice, subtly trying to get you to use suggestive language, who take weird pleasure in revealing they’ve been masurbating the whole time.   what i’m saying is that almost every lifeline worker i’ve met starts out a shift with a goal of really helping people, and are fully trained to do so (it takes a months long course, and years of provisional placement  before you’re fully qualified). they’re serious about this work, and they’re doing it for free. but it’s entirely possible that they’ve been putting up with a world of shit in their prior 3 calls and don’t quite meet your needs or use the right tone or language with you. as /u/aducknamedphil said, they’re people too.

72693	0	a	we don't really know, and there are different theories. the one raised by the greeks themselves is that sparta thought it unrighteous to destroy a state that had done so much for greece during the persian wars. we don't need to be too skeptical of this, as political reasoning based on tradition and stories was common enough in greek interstate politics. nevertheless, we can also suspect some other motives.  the most commonly cited theory is that the spartans were afraid of the growing power of thebes, and worried that razing athens would effectively grant thebes dominance of attika as well, doubling their territory and greatly increasing their resources. this may be a bit anachronistic, but the idea that sparta was playing balance-of-power politics isn't that hard to believe.  an alternative raised by anton powell is that the decision resulted from internal spartan politics. the great victor of the peloponnesian war was a spartan bastard named lysander (bastard in the sense that he was the offspring of an illegitimate relationship and not a full citizen). his influence in the many states he liberated gave him unprecedented power in the greek world, and there were rumours that he had plans to overthrow the spartan kings and rule sparta himself. the spartan kings, led by pausanias, lysander's chief rival, reasoned that the proceeds of razing athens would primarily benefit lysander, and that it would be better to preserve athens as a key protectorate of the kings themselves.

52024aec2eed9c64	0	a	""") this tort reform debate is extremely hot in the sense that although there are no reasonable people in favor of tort reform, it is the position pushed forward by the owners of conngress and the courts. still, those owners of government do not get to vote in this country (usa), and they must convince the voters to vote for the political candidates that will do their biddingsuch candidates are nearly always a member of one or the other of the two major political parties (about half from one party, half from the other). so the hot debate is not so much a partisan debate along """"party lines"""" (note you will not be able to see such lines ona cloudy day, so don't bother to look for them), as it is along the lines of which elected or appointed officials are willing to come out of the closet as kept mistresses, and openly do the bidding of their masters. it's a true nail-biter. the """"debate"""" has been keeping """"voters"""" on the edge of their seats for years, even though numerous laws have been passed that could count as tort reform, if the counters were honest. for example, the 1995 securities litigation reform act, and numerous court decisisons (there's one in front of the supremem court nowwonder if the little guy will win?) which limits the ability of defrauded mom and pop investors in teh stock market to sue fraudulent companiesmany of which are operating under the guise of a fortune 500 firm, as enron did.  (this paragraph is about the article on tort reform and how to make it better, and asking for collective discussion. please do not delete from discussion on tort reform article.  ) tort reform is everywhere like love in the 60s. it is the wave of the future. someday all of us will wear ankle bracelets and be glad we are not behind bars thanks only to tort reform.  (this paragraph is about the article on tort reform and how to make it better, and asking for collective discussion. please do not delete from discussion on tort reform article.  ) so, in conclusion, it is plain that an objective or neutral pov on tort reform will be difficut to achieve. nonetheless, i applaud those who tried to square the circle and turn lead into gold. however, anyone claiming to be attempting to achieve neutrality on tort reform is by their own admission working for the devil. ruready2testify    added again with additional explanation.

9f163747e5cac904	0	a	(utc) the 2008 ratification of the great lakes commission finally commits american and canadian governments to the geographical definition of the north american great lakes as a distinctive political entity.  in fact and operation, the complex cooperative management of the great lakes for purposes of trade, border discipline, parks, transportation, hydro-power, water management and environmental protection has been a reality since 1815.   ethnically and economically, the borders have always been porous.   politically, the region has more bi-national commonalities than generally supposed.    much of ontarian political culture derived from both anglo-american heritage and the simultaneous influence and threat of american examples.   more importantly, both the american and canadian sides played analogous roles in the world-economy.   both sides of the border transformed from peripheries that supplied natural resources; to semi-peripheries that performed middle-man brokerage functions; to core regions, represented by such world cities as chicago and toronto, that provided hubs of capital, administration, and management.   history, politics, culture, and ethnic composition, as well as the more obvious economy, technology, and geology, define ontario and american great lakes states as one region.  04:11, 27 january 2009

66081	0	a	this is correct. and i think it's useful to understand that most compilers are compiled iteratively, called bootstrapping: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bootstrapping_(compilers)  as an example: rust is written in rust and compiled with the rust compiler. they did this by first writing a bare-bones rust compiler in ocaml, used that compiler to compile a rust compiler written in rust, and then began compiling each new version of rust with the previous version's compiler. ocaml does the same thing: it's written in ocaml that was bootstrapped with a compiler written in c. c itself is written in c, and was bootstrapped with an assembler. the assembler itself translates assembly language to machine code which is what actually runs on the processor.  so once we got the first steps down (e.g. c to assembly to machine code) everything was built up from there.

66301	0	a	"well the reason the temperature in the past was so much higher is that the high co2 levels persisted for many thousands of years allowing for the progressive accumulation of water vapor in the atmosphere which accelerated the greenhouse effect. co2 is actually the second most important greenhouse gas behind water vapor, though it is often the trigger for climatic change because it's concentration in the atmosphere is controlled by a variety of complex processes where as water vapor is effectively controlled by temperature and pressure. over time the increased temperature has a positive feedback with water in the atmosphere allowing for very elevated temperatures. it's worth noting that when we say the ""the last time"" we are taking a snapshot of a world that had been experiencing those conditions for millenia.  we currently believe we can keep the warming around 2c because we are projecting mitigation and emission reduction strategies that will eventually slow the warming trend. in the short term (geologically speaking) that means a temperature rise of around 2c."

81467	0	a	story time folks:  several years ago, this happened to me and my sister. we were in my dad’s apartment and we were fending for ourselves while he was at work. (we were between the ages of 18-20 at the time.)   she was frying pork chops are something and then i hear her call for my help. i casually walk over to the kitchen and see about a small fire burning on the stove.   “oh shit!” i think to myself. “we need to smother this.” i start looking for a pot lid or something to cover up the pan.   well as i’m failing my investigation check, my sister has filled a small tupperware container with water. the next moment happens in the slow motion for me. i watch with pure terror as her extends her arm and flicks the contents of the container onto the fire.  you guessed it folks, the above gif is precisely what happened to my father’s kitchen.   i vividly remember standing and staring as the flames began to climb up the walls and across the ceiling. i honestly don’t know how or why the flames just abruptly stopped burning but they did. thankfully no one was hurt.   my sister learned a valuable lesson that day about oil, water and grease fires. and we also learned that mr.clean magic erasers do a fairly good job of cleaning up the charred evidence of our fuck up as we proceeded to scrub down the kitchen walls.   tl;dr - my sister is no chemist and set fire to my dad’s kitchen via this method.

74142	0	a	"i see a lot of anecdotal responses saying something like: ""cannabis really helps with **xx** because every time i smoke weed i actually get more **xx** not less?""    one thing to remember is that cannabinoids mess with brain chemistry, and anything that messes with brain chemistry will have different effects on different people's brains.  this is true of any medication that messes with brain chemistry.    as an example i have been prescribed clonazepam for my anxiety several times by several different doctors with the promise that it is like cannabis without the high.  i am sure for many people it is just like cannabis without the high, but for me it feels like my brain is being strangled.  i can't think straight at all, simple problems like navigating my daughter's messy room becomes an impossible task because i literally can not figure out how to walk around the stuff in my way.  this in turn makes me angry and because the clonazepam inhibits my ability to control anger i am really likely to start yelling and throwing stuff.  not good at all...  in the end cannabis might make you personally really anxious/depressed/lazy, but that might just be a you thing."

d67bee158e51d8b0	0	a	removing edits concerning air crash investigations and qualifying them as third class spam   someone (andythegrump) is accusing me of putting information about aircraft investigations as third class spam mail on wikipedia. this is outrageous and completely ridiculous. i am an aviation specialist, i was general manager of large airports (among others schiphol-amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated erasmus university rotterdam, 1973))and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. netherlands, indonesia, chad, philippines) on issues regarding aviation. i am a registered transport consultant at the world bank and the asian development bank.i can proof that on every account. the problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in english, not all use metric systems.  many reports are not easy to obtain, or simply (against all international rules) not available. this is very frustrating for people working in this field. everybody likes to avoid the mistakes others made. not everybody is american, there are also asians, africans, russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. for this reason we publish for many years these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in english. this makes comparison easy. aviation security and safety is not a joke. because we are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. i do not see what is wrong with this. publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large, the books become too expensive (especially for third world countries) and after a certain time the publication is no more available. you should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us. you think we make any money out of this? think about translation costs, not everybody works for free. this way you do not help wikipedia, but you are a stumble block. you are probably some kind of johnny the selfkicker.  dr. dirk j. barreveld, netherlands  (  )

(according to indian astrology, it was saturday 4.37 am, sukla patcham, sasti thithi, swathi nakshatram, subranama yogam, gowlawa karanam, thula rasi kadaga lagnam)         swamy's father siva thiru mallaya dasa bhagavathar was well known for his discourses on ancient purana & ethics. he was a great scholar, his knowledge and wisdom in purana, ethics and literature were unlimited. hence, he was conferred with the title """"puranethikasa paarangathar"""". he established 'thirupugazh sabhas' in each and every place to propagate """"thirupugazh"""" , the songs which spell the glory of god muruga.    madhu shri kanagavalli ammaiyar, mother of our swamigal was a noble, highly discipline calm, affectionate holy woman. she was always align with the thoughts of her husband. her kindness and helping tendency towards mankind particularly towards poor was endless.     the parents of our swamigal belongs to veera saiva dynasty (primarily followers of lord siva) got 11 children, the fourth child was our swamigal.   tab      the almighty now and then exposes his greatness for the well being of mankind makes saints to born in this world. in this chain of saints, our swamigal known as deiva thiru muruga kirupanantha variyar swamigal came to this world at the beginning of 20th century.life of swamigal spread over the devotional activities, religious rites, particularly swamigal made saint arunagirinathar's 'thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.    'swamigal established thiruvarul dhavaneri manram' with his own cost and appointed preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and ideals.  swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his life made men to live as men.  naturally one may not be talented in all subjects one may possess high knowledge in one matter but least about other.  one may be a good orator but not at all a good author.  one may be good writer but not a good orator. some may possess in depth knowledge in sangamliterature, but do not possess any knowledge or interest in literature pertaining to religion.  even people who are well versed in religious literature may not do well in music.but our swamigal had enormous and deep knowledge and practice of all these arts and literature. in short he conquered, devotion, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast knowledge of texts.   tab the grand mother of swamigal lived in kurnool. there was a great saint known as 'gurubalam' who possessed many talents (ashtama siddies). out of his power he could turn camphor cubes into golden cubes.one day that grand mother(mother of swamigal's mother) took her son-in-law mallayadasar (swamigal's father) to the said saint gurubalam to get a golden cube for the her son in law. saint gurubalam knew this matter through his spritual thought.he asked """"whether the golden cube which i give last  forever? """"further he told """"a child is conceived and being grown in the stomach of your daughter kanagavalli and by the child your entire home will be spread with golden cubes"""". according  to the saints words so born was our variyar swamigal.    our swamigal never stepped into any school. but his father mallayadasar taught him education, literature, grammer, music and instrumental music, particularly veena, swamigal started reading and learning texts at third year of his age.swamigal was capable of authoring venbas (a sort of tamil lyric) at his eighth year of age.  at his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems and authored texts like 'ashta naga bandham', 'mayil','vel', and 'sivalinga bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned scholars.  according to the veera saiva customs swamigal wore sivalingam(sivalinga tharanam) at his fifth year in pana patrar mutt in thiruvannamalai. swamigal received upadesam 'satakkara mantram' from his father and received upadesam 'sutchuma satakkara mantram' from thirupugazh swamigal.palani easana sivachariya swamigal graced our swamigal 'nirvana dhiksha' and named him as 'vama deva sivam' (dhikshanamam). swamigal learnt 'veena' from bhramma sri then madam varadhachariyar.    in his early days swamigal had dharshan of 'srimath pamban swamigal' . later once swamigal received sadakkara upadesam from pamban swamigal in dream. bhramma sri loganatha iyyer known as madurai thirupugazh swamigal established thirupugazh saba at adi street"

66618	0	a	i once went to a birthday party in 6th grade and gave my friend a dollar in a hand made card. my family was dirt poor — it was a miracle there was enough gas in the car to get me to the party. any money i had at that point was money i’d earned myself doing odd jobs in the neighborhood, which usually consisted of picking up dead groundhogs my neighbor had shot and throwing them over a cliff. i knew my family had nothing, i knew i couldn’t show up with nothing, and that dollar was literally all i had to offer.  i think my friend understood to a degree, but given that she was 11 or 12, she wasn’t too skilled at schooling her features. it really sucked.

63093	0	a	i feel like this was one of the big themes of the raimi spiderman films; that all the people who are gruff and unpleasant in peter's life all are good people when it counts.    jonah jameson would have died to protect peter when assaulted by the goblin, the new yorkers attack the goblin by throwing everything they can at him from the bridge, telling the goblin that spidey is one of them.  the people that he saves in the train protect his identity and stand between him and doc ock to protect him.  peter's slavic landlord that harasses him worries for him and tells everyone how good a kid he is in spiderman 3.    i don't think that flash thompson is well featured after peter leaves highschool in the raimi films, but in the comics it is demonstrated that the jock that tries to bully peter always wanted to be a hero and just needed the right example.  spiderman becomes his idol, and he later becomes close friends with peter, and becomes rather heroic himself in a quieter more realistic way.  (until the agent venom storyline, then he becomes a legitimate superhero.)  i think that the films were trying to make a point about how people are inherently good, and worth protecting, even if they don't seem so on the surface.

66468	0	a	"all hydro, gas, nuclear, and coal plants connected to the grid have governor systems which control the amount of fuel (water, steam, etc) entering the turbine in an attempt to keep the system frequency at 60hz. if system frequency falls, all generator governors connected to the grid pass more fuel to the turbine to speed it up. the opposite is true for high frequency. a perfect 60hz ac on the grid requires an exact balance of generation and demand, but since load is varying all the time, frequency is mostly maintained within about 59.98 to 60.02 hz. beyond these ranges, if frequency starts to get really bad (like 59.8 to 60.2 hz), then special protection systems will automatically disconnect loads or generators to return the frequency to normal. since the eastern and western halves of north america are separate synchronous grids (with the exception of quebec and texas), every region in each of those grids has to be perfectly balanced to maintain frequency. if the grid as a whole has been under or over generated for a significant amount of time, it produces ""time error"", the slowing or speeding of a clock which runs on the 60hz mains frequency compared to a reference clock. in the eastern interconnect, time error is measured and recorded by one system operator designated the time monitor. once time error exceeds 10 seconds positive or negative, all system operators in the interconnect participate in a ""time error correction"", in which they change their scheduled system frequency to 59.98 or 60.02hz. this causes their automatic generation control systems (fast moving regulation for small changes in demand without requiring redispatch of the whole generation fleet) to trend generation slightly high or low for a time, reversing the time error until it reaches around 0 seconds again. if you look for time error correction on nerc's website, it dives into a lot of detail. whether or not this is still necessary, i don't really know, but time error correction is definitely still done.

71778	0	a	the answer, as far as i can tell, is that we don’t know for certain. what we know about the development of pillows and bedding, however, suggests a few options.   i found this site which details the history of the pillow.   http://hankeringforhistory.com/pillows-throughout-the-ages-guest-post/  the oldest known pillows date back around 9,000 years and are made of carved stone. the shape suggests suggests an attempt at providing comfort...a smooth surface is much better for laying your head on, after all, than a rough one. it’s also been suggested by historians that pillows like this protected people from bugs. it’s possible, therefore, that cavemen used nearby rocks to keep their heads elevated.    this is not, however, the oldest known bedding. that dates back 77,000 years and consists of compressed grass, leaves, and plant stems found at archaeological site called the sidubu cave. interestingly, the specific plants they found in the bedding served as natural insecticides, suggesting that protection from bugs was at the front of mind due cavemen as it was for ancient egyptians. it’s possible a mound of this material was used on top of the bedding as a makeshift pillow. here is the study.   http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/12/earliest-human-beds-found-south-africa  lastly, the japanese geisha have used wooden blocks with cushioning on top to serve as a pillow. these blocks allowed them to protect their elaborate hair styles while sleeping. a log or other piece of wood, therefore, is a potential third option for cavemen pillows.   in the case of rocks and pillows, there’s no reason grass and leaves couldn’t have been used as a softer barrier to increase comfort. we wouldn’t know that, however, since such technology wouldn’t necessarily register with archaeologists if it wasn’t shaped or processed on some way such as to distinguish it from other debris.   edit: the rocks are no longer imprisoned. til proofreading matters.

64023	0	a	i live in fl & work at a restaurant.. we used to have this homeless man, gregory, come in every day and order a soda and just sit at the bar and watch tv for hours, to escape the heat. it’s so damn hot so we didn’t blame him, and didn’t mind either. he always kept to himself. he had a couple bags that he would drop off at the host stand and we would make sure no one touched them. it became so routine we would just comp a dish and his soda for him every day. then we were (indirectly) hit by a hurricane last season, and everyone had to evacuate. no one saw him after that. we were all really worried and decided to raise money so that if he did come back, he would have a little financial cushion.   well he never made his way back.. and i thought of him very often and worried about him. my late brother was homeless for a while at the peak of his mental illness, and gregory reminded me a lot of him. i was scared something happened to greg as it’s a very hard life.   until a few weeks ago. i’ve been going through a hard time and heartbreak so i’ve been seeing a therapist. her office is on the opposite side of town, an area i typically wouldn’t visit, but it was the only practice i could get in. well, i was ubering the 40 minutes home and as i was sitting in the back seat starring out the window thinking about life, we came to a stop at a light. who do i see sitting at the bus stop? gregory.   i couldn’t help but smile really big. maybe his circumstances haven’t dramatically changed, it seemed like he’s still living on the streets... but he’s safe.

3eb4d550c1b0f179	0	a	as a non-new yorker, non-american outsider, i would have to say that nyc is without doubt one of the most important cities on earth, definately the most important in the western world. just the fact that it's the centre of the western economy, somebody from every nation lives there, the business and media centre of the current superpower and home to the united nations speaks volumes. it sounds like a crazy guy talking, but if aliens wanted to destroy the earth, which city would they go to first?
54839	0	a	exactly the same as the 4 minute mile, to do it at all was absolutely insane. for the record i think the 4 minute mile had 3 other pacers in the race.  the irony is that the pacers also broke the 2 hour record (if they were present from start to finish)
65631	0	a	interesting is that the closeness of both numbers (degrees in a circle and days in a year) is not a coincidence.   5150 years ago the sumerians were the first (that we know of) to count the days of the year (to know when to seed the grains, and using the fact that the shadow of a stone at noon each day repeats after a year). they got the 360±4 days number, which is relatively close to 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360 - and they already considered the 3 x 4 x 5 = 60 a pretty magic number (roughly how we consider 100 a significant number today) so surely that cannot be a coincidence, it must mean something!   so the sumerians picked a 360 days year, and decreed that the remaining 5 days are outside of the year, so why work then if nobody counted interest on loans during those  days (by religious decree), let's spent 5 days partying, drinking, and celebrating the new year!   and this is why we have 360 degrees around the circle - one degree is the distance covered by the earth around the sun during one day.

66133	0	a	the phoenician alphabet is descended from the earlier ugaritic alphabet, which actually had [two letter orders in use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ugaritic_alphabet#abecedaries) at the time, the northern and southern semitic orders. the phoenician alphabet (and thus its descendants) just happened to use the northern semitic order, so it's really just an accident of history. the southern semitic order is still reflected today in the ethiopian ge'ez script. interestingly, ethiopians often refer to the ge'ez as halehame (after the first four letters of the southern semitic order) just as the words alphabet, abecedary, abugida, abjad etc refer to the first two to four letters of the northern semitic order and its descendants.

51507	0	a	i’m laying next to my 3mo right now while my wife is down stairs with our 3yo. we love them more than anything in the world. there are definitely stressors though. we’re sleep training our youngest because we didn’t sleep for a year with our oldest. we both teach, so we’ll be paying for daycare very soon. who knew that we have an extra $1600 a month just lying around?  when i read child care subsidies up above, i shed a wishful tear. how in a country like the united states do we not have those?! everyone agrees that we need to take care of our children and early intervention is key to later success, but helping pay for daycare is just a no no, i guess.  edit: i didn’t mean for this comment to be taken as “america sucks.” i love this damn country and it’s done a lot of good in the world. hell it still is, but these social programs that just seem common sense to me shouldn’t be a political talking point. it should be a reality. america’s amazing, it should be the world leader in things like this again.

3452c997c1e086e0	0	a	i was born and raised a muslim and i know from personal experience how that term is used to discriminate against people. though you maybe correct that i have strong pov with this issue. there are many concerns that need to be discussed with the article. we all agree that the original version, the one before the major edits was no good becuase it lacked sources, citations and it had a strong anti-islamic bias and was strongly pov from the other side. the term is very broadly applied and it is defined differently by diferent people. the prior version of the article focused on degrading islam. one thing that is not understood by anybody here is that islam is inherently a political religion. islam is a religion meant to be applied to governments. though the term islamism has been defined by other people and most of you guys are just reflecting on that. this article is still strongly pov from the otherside. reagrdless, this is a very controversial topic and i think we should start fresh again.

72737	0	a	thank you to lcnielsen, great comment! while reading it, i had a follow-up question occur to me, both that comment and the op in general.  while legacy is certainly a massive part in the bias, is it also possible that the settled-nomad dichotomy is at play as well?   as far as i can remember my uni classes, most settled peoples had a very lowly view on nomadic peoples, and for some living closer to these groups, outright feared them (e.g. china). chinggis' rule seems to be far more lenient than most conquerors' (that is, if your city surrendered), yet it is rarely remembered for its tolerance for religion or opening of safe trade routes. are there any reasons to to believe this attribute plays into this as well?

71823	0	a	the existing top comment correctly realises the op is asking an age old question, that of olber's paradox. the top comment though goes on to make some mistakes, the first is the solution of the paradox and the second is crossing the cmbr with the paradox which are not related.  the paradox is: if the universe is infinite then in every direction there must be a star. in such a scenario the whole sky would be a uniform brightness, the same brightness as the surface of a star in fact.  the paradox was first resolved long before we knew about the expansion of space, with a finite speed of light and a finite life time for stars there is only so much of the universe that each star can be illuminating at once. imagine a shell that has a thickness equal to a stars lifetime propagating through the universe at c.  we later learned that not only would an infinite universe not be bright that our universe is not infinite, there is a observation horizon due to it's expansion and a start point 13.7bn years ago. this defeats the entire premise of the paradox where every single line of sight direction intersects with a star.  while you can explain the lack of light from distant stars as being due to redshift, it is answering a question already answered and is being a bit dishonest anyway since, you are going to be caught out in several other aspects of the more classical solution on your way to a more complicated unnecessary solution. for example, if you were to work out the average redshift of each unit solid angle in the sky you would find the sky would be much brighter than it is, and much much brighter than the 2.7k you rattled off.  this 2.7k is where the mistake really lies is in equating the redshift from distant stars to the cmbr. the cmbr was not emitted by stars (which are the subject of the op and olber's paradox) but by a global distribution of hot gas circa 380,000 years after the big bang.   the biggest difference here is that the cmbr was in every direction, unlike stellar light which is only where a star is, it was also initially much cooler (<3000k) and importantly this was emitted long before - and therefore much more heavily redshifted - than the light from even the earliest, most distant stars.

72591	0	a	it definitely is getting repetitive, but on the flip side, the format does make for a fairly specific and clear question. and early on at least, i would even say original! it still has potential even, and with a bit of subverting could still lead to some interesting thing (the mod team was in agreement the question flipping it to a woman was a nice twist).  what i will say though is that as a question gets stale, people get less interested in *answering* them, and the continued use of the pattern will likely lead to them going unanswered, unlike the early ones which got some really great responses (which likely helped get the momentum going). so that is something people should consider when using the format.

(id proponents, though, are themselves two-faced about this point.) this subject is very contentious and i despair of ever seeing a fully objective article. when i'm in wiki-land, i do as the wikipedians doadhere to the 5 pillars. also, i hope you've caught on that the specific variety of intelligent design of which this particular article treats is the id of the discovery institute and its affiliates and sympathizers.

72537	0	a	"as the singer-songwriter [tom waits said in an interview on *america2night* in may 1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xfqbwynysk), when asked if he liked to drink: ""i'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."" by 1978, when waits said these words, the horror of the frontal lobotomy was obvious, but it took doctors some time to realise how damaging the frontal lobotomy was. so it would have likely taken joe kennedy some time to realise that the procedure he had put rosemary through was as damaging as it actually was.  in the 1940s, neuroscience was very much in its infancy compared to today, and the nature of the brain and the location of particular faculties of the brain was still often up for debate. a famous much-studied case of memory loss, h.m., became that way because a neurosurgeon in 1953 excised a part of the brain that was involved in making new memories, in the belief it would help cure h.m.'s epilepsy (which it indeed seems to have partially helped). it was only after careful study of cases like h.m. that neuroscientists began to understand more about how the brain worked (along with the rise of, especially fmri research in the last 20-30 years); the neurosurgeon had no idea his incisions would have the effect of causing anterograde amnesia. but thanks to intensive study of h.m., we do now. the medical belief at the time was that intelligence worked via the integration of brain fibers from multiple cortical areas. thus, if a part of the brain was damaged, the removal of brain areas that were damaged might actually *improve* mental function rather than severely slow it down, because it was no longer getting in the way of the rest of the brain doing its work.  so, in the 1940s, it seemed perfectly reasonable to many doctors that the frontal lobotomy might be profitably excised from a range of problematic patients - nobody knew what it was for, and patients afterwards seemed much less upset. indeed, antonio egas moriz, who pioneered the frontal lobotomy, won a nobel prize in medicine in 1949 for his efforts (clearly denoting that doctors had found it a godsend).  obviously, however, this belief was wrong. in 1941, when rosemary kennedy underwent the procedure, it was still a relatively new procedure in america. in 1942, however, freeman and watts published a textbook, *psychosurgery*, which contributed to the popularity of the lobotomy; the same year, the *journal of the american medical association* published an editorial asserting that lobotomy was preferable in situations were remission was remote. in the popular magazine *coronet* in 1942 was an article titled 'psychsurgery cured me', with a tag line about how it was an ""inspiring story of a nervous wreck, miraculously restored to normal life and happiness by a surgeon's knife"". in 1941, in the *saturday evening post*, an article about the procedure suggested that ""from problems to their families and nuisances to themselves, [many] have been transformed into useful members of society. a world that once seemed the abode of misery, cruelty and hate is now radiant with sunshine and kindness to them."" so, all things in all, joe kennedy was simply following a promising new medical procedure that doctors were advising; it would not have been initially clear in 1942 that rosemary's condition after the surgery was a problem.  some doctors *had* argued against the lobotomy from the start as being too radical and/or a violation of the hippocratic oath, but they clearly didn't have enough heft to have it banned. the first particularly prominent public criticism of the lobotomy came in published articles in *time* and *life* magazine about the procedures in 1946, based on criticism from (freudian-influenced) psychiatrists who believed that the neurosurgeons didn't understand the mind. but psychiatrists speaking freudian gobbledygook were easy enough to ignore. so between 1941 and 1947, at least 1725 lobotomies were performed, it being seen as a proper and useful medical procedure. thus the nobel prize for egas moniz in 1949.  it was instead in the early 1950s - ironically, as the lobotomy became much more popular thanks to the hoopla around the nobel prize - when it became clear that the lobotomy was particularly troublesome. the national institute of mental health in the usa held several conferences around 1949-1951 which suggested that lobotomies were being carried out much too carelessly, and that criteria for outcomes were not specific enough (e.g., it was hard to tell whether there was improvement as a result of lobotomies because nobody was really looking properly). this disquiet eventually resulted in a landmark 1958 study by aa robin, which carefully measured things, and convincingly found that lobotomies did not improve outcome. but also, before 1958, neuroscientific knowledge had progressed to the point where it was realised that the typical prefrontal lobotomy as practiced by most psychosurgeons was also excising the 'visceral brain' (including the hypothalamus), and not just the prefrontal lobes (and that freeman and watts were nowhere near sufficiently careful enough in their excisions, to the extent that they weren't accounting for differences in brain size).  public opinion against the frontal lobotomy turned decisively in 1949, when a scientific meeting where harsh words were said about the frontal lobotomy was reported upon in *newsweek* and the *new york times* in 1950-1951, articles in the *scientific american* and the *saturday evening post* struck an ambivalent tone about the procedures. in 1953, a *new york times* article titled ""lobotomy banned in soviet as cruel"", concluded that 'the procedure is contrary to the principles of humanity', and that 'through lobotomy, an insane person is changed into an idiot'.   despite this criticism (and perhaps because of the nobel prize), many neurosurgeons continued to perform lobotomies in the early 1950s; it was only with the introduction of chlorpromazine to treat schizophrenia in 1954 that lobotomies started to recede in prominence. but freeman was still advocating the procedure in public as late as 1958 and still performing them as late as 1967.  so while joe kennedy may or may not have been horrified by what had happened to rosemary kennedy after the frontal lobotomy, frontal lobotomies were still a common surgery a decade after her operation, and many doctors would still have been advising concerned parents that a frontal option was a better option than the alternative.  it should still be pointed out that doctors still remove important parts of the frontal cortex in specific situations, to try and alleviate issues for patients. for example, in severe cases of epilepsy, parts of the brain that seem to precipitate the seizures are sometimes removed, and this can include parts of the prefrontal lobe in some cases; in my other life as a music psychologist rather than a reddit historian, i reviewed at a bunch of research that had been done on people who have had (parts of) their temporal lobes excised (edit: as /u/sunagainstgold points out, these are lobectomies, not lobotomies, and for the unfamiliar, the temporal lobe is a different part of the brain to the prefrontal lobe), because that surgery had a severe effect on their ability to understand music (note: yes, that's fascinating, but no, you'll have to ask about that in another subreddit).   sources:  * kucharski (1984). 'history of frontal lobotomy in the united states, 1935-1955', in the journal *neurosurgery*.  * diefenbach, diefenbach, baumeister, and west (1999). 'portrayal of lobotomy in the popular press: 1935-1960', in *journal of the history of the neurosciences*"

66219	0	a	technically it's what goes on inside every solid-fuel flame.   gas isn't dense enough to create the kind of light you see from a campfire.  what's happening is that the visible flame is the area where all the oxygen is gone.   the heat pyrolyses the fuel,  vaporizing it. but with no oxygen it can't burn. the fuel floats up through the flame to the edge where there is oxygen available.   once at the edge it can burn,  and does so, releasing heat.  this heats up the vapor still in the flame making it hot enough to visibly glow in the visible spectrum.   hence, visible flames.  ie campfire flames aren't showing you combustion.   they're areas of glowing fuel vapor stuck in an oxygen-less bubble.  when they reach the edge of that bubble they burn, vaporizing and heating more fuel, and eating up oxygen so the inner bubble stays o2-free.  the combustion is on the tips of the flames. the flames are just fuel lines.

(i know more about roswell in cobb county, than fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. roswell king and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became roswell) were from the coast. king brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at darien, ga, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. archibald smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in st. marys county and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in roswell. king's idea was to have cotton production and  processing in the same place. the forced migration of slaves from the coast to north ga meant they brought their unique geechee culture and language with them.  where slaves were held in larger numbers on plantations, it's likely they kept their culture and traditions going.)   atlanta and fulton county in fact more than doubled in population from 1860 to 1870. people rushed to rebuild the city.  in a pattern typical of other areas, many newly freed african-americans left plantations to move to town to work at trades or crafts, to have safety in numbers and to try to set up lives apart from white control.    by 1870 fulton county had grown to 33,446 people.  among them were 15,282 """"colored"""", as defined by the census, 45.7% of the population.   noteworthy citizens: atlanta boasts two nobel prize winners: rev. martin luther king, the youngest man to receive the nobel prize, and president jimmy carter.  each were awarded the nobel prize for peace.

66509	0	a	i wouldn't necessarily say that an ant colony is a single organism, but colony insects certainly evolve as though they were a single organism. when only one member of the population reproduces, evolution proceeds quite differently. most creatures evolve according to what is best for individual survival and reproduction, but ants have no evolutionary pressure to preserve the individual - a population's ability to procreate is affected only by the survival of the queen. a queen whose offspring behaved to maximize their own survival will not do as well as a queen whose offspring are expendable. worker ants do not have the same kind of self preservation instinct that mammals do, because their evolution is guided by what is most effective at feeding and protecting the queen rather than natural selection pressuring for individual survival. a queen ant's survival strategy is essentially to have a zillion non-fertile babies who will take care of its every need and do not have offspring of their own. because worker insects do not reproduce on their own, they evolve to benefit their queen instead of to benefit themselves. the whole colony's evolutionary path is determined by the well-being of a single organism.   ants, bees, and other colony insects are called eusocial animals, which means that they have evolved to prioritize the good of the population as a whole rather than the good of the individual.

(especially if you hydrate properly and consume salts.) you can actually then go a few more weeks before you start feeling especially bad.   common sense would have told you that the longer you go without eating, the hungrier you get, but it turns out that's totally wrong.   the fundamental goal behind science is putting all of your pre-existing ideas up for challenge, and testing them to see if they deserve to be kept or discarded.   science is obligated to perform studies on the things we believe to be most obvious, because that's the only way we can continue to get less wrong.

50712	0	a	"i cannot answer your first question, but i can provide insights on the second.  the idea that america was built on multiculturalism appeared very early. by the 1780s, the term ""melting together"" was a widespread metaphor in use that was meant to positively portray incoming immigrants. of course, america had just ousted a foreign power from their backs, so nationalism was running high.  hamilton, an immigrant from  nevis, argued vehemently against immigration, arguing that immigrants brought pro-monarchy and ethnic views that would undermine their new, fragile country. he also argued that america's bountiful resources and exploding population meant that america didn't need to rely on newcomers. from the hamilton papers,  examination number viii, jan 12th, 1802:  *in the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed. it appears from the last census, that we have increased about one third in ten years; after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security and settlement.*  at first, the two dominant parties of the time (federalists and democratic-republicans) mostly agreed on keeping out immigrants. thomas jefferson wrote in his *notes on the state of virginia* in 1781 that foreigners would be anti-democracy. however, by the turn of the 19th century, the democratic-republicans viewed pro-immigration policies as a great way to undermine the federalists.  see, hamilton and the federalists were afraid of the french, who were at the time being led by napoleon after the bloody french revolution. jefferson and the democratic-republicans pursued pro-french policy—and more proactive foreign relations with other countries—which included immigration. jefferson saw immigrants as future voters for the democratic-republican party. as with many of these social issues, divisions in public opinion came from the very top, so voters tended to side with their party's views. so pro-immigration stances tended to saturate more educated democratic-republicans. the election of 1800 was a particularly nasty affair, as the battle lines between both sides slung serious vitriol to get their candidates elected. john adams, the federalist incumbent, faced off a challenge against jefferson. adams was pro-class and cultural hierarchy, while jefferson wanted to model the country's democracy on the new post-revolution french model.  it should be pointed out that both adams and jefferson saw the 1800 election as a fight over america's soul—that the election would set in stone the standards for how america would treat the subject of immigration for the rest of time. jefferson would later write: *the revolution of 1800... was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in its form.*  jefferson and his democratic-republican allies would use the melting together metaphor extensively in their campaigning, making 1800 probably the biggest pivot on pro-immigrant sentiment for the general public as self-identified d-r party members adopted jefferson's messages.  finally, the d-r party wasn't free from bias, and fought internally (and extensively) over what type of immigration was considered acceptable by them:  *the meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. the debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted american society and on how immigrants should be approached. the melting pot was equated with either the acculturation of the total assimilation of european immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: 'was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on anglo-protestants like henry ford and woodrow wilson, or was the idea instead that everyone, mayflower descendants and sicilians, ashkenazi and slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?* (baofu, 21-22)  the term ""melting together,"" and other various close iterations of the same idea, was solidified in the public's vernacular as ""melting pot"" in 1908, when the play *the melting pot* by israel zangwill was released and became popular.  edit: thank you for correctly pointing out that hamilton was from  nevis, not puerto rico.  sources:  [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/hamilton/01-25-02-0282](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/hamilton/01-25-02-0282)  alexander hamilton (lucius crassus), *examination of jefferson’s message to congress of december 7, 1801*, viii, january 7, 1802, in henry cabot lodge, ed., the works of alexander hamilton, vol. 8 (new york: putnam’s, 1904)  “alexander hamilton on the naturalization of foreigners.” *population and development review*, vol. 36, no. 1, 2010, pp. 177–182. *jstor*, jstor, [www.jstor.org/stable/25699042](http://www.jstor.org/stable/25699042).  blumenthal, sidney.

72fc96f669da3754	0	a	as per advice from several relevant authorities, i have deleted the offending paragraph in the temple lot article, and the identical one at 'church of christ temple lot.'   i am not doing this as an amateur wikipedia editor, but as the private citizen who is being 'outed' and defamed in two wikipedia articles (so far).   i have been advised to delete the offending passage, and then wait and see who exactly restores it. that person (unless it is a smackbot, an automatic revert), will in turn be 'outed' and 'named' as the subject of a criminal investigation.  yes, this is a 'legal threat,' and i don't appreciate various inept wikipedia administrators threatening me in order to dissuade me from complaining to law enforcement about a crime which is being committed: the willful invasion of privacy, and defamation of a u.s. citizen, in contravention to numerous local, state, and federal laws, as well as in contravention to numerous strict and explicit wikipedia policies regarding inclusion of a person's name in a wikipedia article. the following excerpt is just one example of wikipedia guidelines which have been willfully, persistently and openly ignored and defied by wikipedia editor after wikipedia editor.  again...whoever restores the defamatory passage which includes my nameor any paragraph, sentence or article which includes my namewill be investigated and [hopefully] prosecuted for doing so. in other words, i will press criminal charges against the perpetrator.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:blp#privacy_of_names   privacy of names  caution should be applied when naming individuals who are discussed primarily in terms of a single event. when the name of a private individual has not been widely disseminated or has been intentionally concealed (such as in certain court cases), it is often preferable to omit it, especially when doing so does not result in a significant loss of context. when evaluating the inclusion or removal of names, their publication in secondary sources other than news media, such as scholarly journals or the work of recognized experts, should be afforded greater weight than the brief appearance of names in news stories.  editors should take particular care when considering whether inclusion of the names of private, living individuals who are not directly involved in an article's topic adds significant value. the presumption in favor of the privacy of family members of articles' subjects and other loosely involved persons without independent notability is correspondingly stronger.
52fc0d66261db2a0	0	a	i added a few to that list expecting to take the time to find each of the three-dozen or so dry towns, but i never returned to it.  that is an interesting story about swansea...something that would defy the claims of non-notables by the deletionist editors intractable like summerphd. i cannot think of any dry towns up in north jersey although i know of a few temperance movement events in the late 19th/early 20th c. i think it has to be a chiefly south jersey phenomenon. too many germans and italians were up here and that likely make an environment hostile to something akin to a temperance town ever take root in the north.

71821	0	a	here's a video with a great explanation of both the parodox and the answer.  https://youtu.be/yqz0vgmngpq   the paradox is basically.  1) if the universe is infinite then no matter where you look eventually you will directly see a star.  2) if every point in the night sky directly leads to a star then the entire sky will be as bright as all those stars.   i've seen a lot of responses about light dropping off in intensity based on distance however you have an infinite number of stars so it doesn't really matter how little light each star provides.  the correct answer to this parodox is that the universe is not infinitely old. so light from stars far away from us hasn't had time to reach us.  the expansion of the universe will prevent us from ever having a sky as bright as the sun because most stars will always be too far away for the light to reach us.

65892	0	a	there is a treatment for stage 4 brain cancer that does this indirectly. duke has modified the polio virus to attack cancer cells, and they inject it into the center of a brain tumor. while the polio virus is attacking the cells, the immune system starts going in to clean up the mess.  in turn, the immune system learns to recognize the cancer cells.  the whole process seems to last for months after just the one single injection.  you can google pvs-ripo for further information.  the first few patients were treated in 2012-2013 and some are still alive without any further treatment. those patients had recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, which is perhaps the deadliest cancer situation that one can imagine.  while this would technically be considered virotherapy, the immune system plays a huge role in the outcome.  they are now in phase 2 trials, and still only for brain tumors, but i believe the assumption is that it could be widely used among many different solid tumors in the future.

(and solely because the public accepts it.)  the problem comes in that wikipedia, as an encyclopedia (and i will call this site on that again and again), grants a statement of """"fact"""" on something which is now fiction, because the public has decided that the event, since it physically took place, cannot be reversed, even if all evidence points to the fact that it should've been.  (and, yes, i will find the same farcical situation in many sports articles.)  and if i must find a """"published fact"""" for something, then personal knowledge becomes irrelevant to the process.  (the final fantasy case.)  if we are not going to trust the general public to do research (wp:or), how do we trust the general public not to manipulate the """"published facts"""" (which see mania xxviii)?  personally, speaking generally, i don't trust most members of the public (far beyond wikipedia) to spell """"cat"""" if they are spotted the """"c"""" and the """"a"""".  how am i going to trust them with a public repository of the """"facts"""" when they get to determine what is """"fact"""" and who gets to post it?  (throwing out pillar #2)  ah, needs to be something the lawyer has signed.  i assert that hasn't happened in cena-rock, myself.  (one of my (ignored) claims was that the level of """"promo"""" of that match is the same as the level of promo in the daniel bryan intended-cash-in!)  and in stating """"these are some of our rules"""", you openly abdicate pillar #5 by your own statement.  the choice is yours, not mine, because the public apparently gets to determine everything in wikipedia as i said above.  how can i carry on an intelligent and informed conversation with someone like christianandjericho, who basically does not know proper english and chooses to type like a 12 year-old girl into a cellphone?  he probably doesn't even understand what i'm saying to him, frankly!  and how can i come to a consensus with a group of people like-minded to that?  at minimum, it's going to take a tban on pro wrestling and at least two ibans on the two other users, for starters.  i can probably come up with at least a pban on a celebrity for a prosecuted 1998 criminal threat on top of it without even taking initial action on the page!

fcf84e06462f4011	0	a	"""   feedback as requested   hey antonin! i'm only too happy to help out (as much as i can) - having sooooo many problems elsewhere. in fact, completely and utterly stuck and rather despondent about it all.   first impressions; not yet a balanced article - a lot on the controversies, too little on the magazine and its background; the latter, i think, needs clarification. what was the czech political-cultural context, and how did this produce the magazine? """"conservative"""" is too vague - i think readers will benefit from being told more about czech conservatism. then there's the magazine itself; who started it (and what were they doing before this?); editorial policy, contributors, transfer of ownership (if any) and whether or not the magazine has changed since its acquisition by the media group.   put it this way: certainly in the uk (and probably in the us), an award for growing the best cannabis plant isn't something usually associated with a conservative magazine...    i'll put this page on my watch-list. i'll be happy to sort out any copy issues, btw. best regards,     thanks for your opinions, davey. you are right, the article is not balanced. i'm trying to use only sources independent on the magazine itself, and unfortunately the sources deal mainly with controversies. there is an overview of the history of reflex in the 20th anniversary issue, i'll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions. btw, reflex is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine; could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well-developed anglo-american journalism and the perception of still """"young"""" independent czech journalism? using of this term in the post-communist world is quite complicated, as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity, and the first free post-communist media (including reflex) had to start building again; to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition. the provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism. this is, however, just my vague point of view. we should probably avoid this association on english wikipedia, as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience. again, thanks for pointing out the problems. i'll work on it.     i've attempted to expand and clarify the origins and background of the magazine as recommended.     yes, i've been hovering over your shoulder the whole time! good beefy stuff... d'you reckon you're pretty much done with the content? 'cos i do, and intend twiddling up the prose some time this weekend. by the way, it's no big deal but are you ok with all those red-links?     hi davey, you won't believe how happy i am seeing that you are still interested! i'm careful with the red links, this project has still gaps in detailed covering of czech topics. all of the red linked names are notable czech journalists. see the czech wiki articles for jan Šibík, petr hájek, jiří x. doležal, tomáš feřtek, josef klíma, jiří pehe, tomáš baldýnský, bohumil pečinka, miloš Čermák, pavlína wolfová. with the red colour i'm trying to point out that they should have articles also here. thank you for your help and interest, ask whatever )     oh, i know how that one feels. it can be a strange and lonely business indeed. still, here come the queries:   constitution and editorial continuity: d'you know who owned it in the first place? was it a one-man show which employed petr hájek? or was he owner and editor? sorry to be picky here, but it'll matter, particularly as this is living persons biog.  yes, the blp issue is the main reason why i asked for your help. hájek was the owner, together with andrej Šťastný and jiří fleyberk. he seems to be the most important one, according to my sources. ok: so the sale of the magazine (over the heads of the editorial board) was entirely legal, despite the resentment. d'you think this was seen as a matter of personal gain and freedom of action (on his part) vs personal responsibility"

51349	0	a	that already is a crisis and the bill is not responsible. the same problem exists in the uk. a student told me recently that the dropout rate is 80% within the first few years. positions are going unfilled entirely because nobody applies.  truth is, teachers have gone from society's respected elders to society's doormat. people don't want to do the job, even those who have specifically been training to do so. they find out what the reality of the job is like and realise, correctly, that the punishment is not worth the compensation.  teacher shortage is not a crisis, it's a catastrophe, and it's offensive to the country and the employees. i can think of little greater long term sacrifice than crippling education. but it's an easy pocket for governments to pick and difficult to assess results either way. you can squeeze the budget and replace it with a new plan of action every 6 months and nobody knows what's what. tell the public there's no problem, job done.

""i just wasn't wired that way.""   then i met her and it all clicked. she understands me like no one else ever has. i tell her everything, even the things i'm ashamed of, scared of, have anxiety about. the things i didn't let another partner know. i allow myself to be vulnerable with her and i'm met with love and support. i've never experienced anything close to what i have with her. honestly, i'm still not even sure how the fuck it happened, but i'm madly in love and just fall deeper in every day. she's become my best friend. definitely doesn't hurt that she's an absolute knockout either.   long story short, be patient, be open to it, and don't give up hope. we all move at our own paces in life.

96773d390d32ae21	0	a	i've been asked to give my thoughts on this matter, and i do feel that a line must be drawn and that this team is certainly not notable for wp. if you think hard enough, every minor or children's league is notable to someone. notable items here need to be notable to a wide region, state, country, not just a city. i think keeping info about the leagues is fine, i have no problem with that at this point. the junior team articles i have seen so far just say the team name and the city, even though it is already stated in the league article. and they will not get any bigger or better unless a lot of unnotable cruft is placed in, which is the last thing that wp needs.   and as for the wikiproject, you don't have to obey to the original standards. a wikiproject is designed to give a community for editors to collaborate on a subject, it's not meant to be official policy. i am stunned that an article like this is kept, it is not even close to being notable outside the area of the team, and should be removed, no doubt about it.

09e6671247cde0ff	0	a	""" history of primal therapy article  i read through the recent discussions on talk:primal_therapy. i also added two more comments to the talk:arthur_janov page. did you send an email enquiry? the 1973 date for france d's marriage to art is without credibility. after the divorce, to vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate arthur janov. after all, he wrote in the original primal scream: """"it is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through primal therapy have never separated."""" (chapter 12). and according to france d. janov's own admission in the primal center's video series 2, she enrolled at the primal institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. so it's a fact that art married a former patient.  my feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the arthur janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. it isn't really the place to dissect janov's reputation. i know it happens in other wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. i agree with your suggestion on the primal therapy talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate history of primal therapy article. the conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so i put together some links to articles which can be found online:  if you type emotional intelligence into google the no.1 result is steve hein's eqi.org website. he interviewed a former patient who attended arthur janov's primal center in the late 1990's. you can find his interview notes here, labelled """"cautionary note"""".  janov's bio on the primal center website states: """"the latest research conducted at dr. janov’s primal center on the effects of primal therapy on the brain was performed by dr. erik hoffman, former professor of neurophysiology at copenhagen university."""" you can read  what erik hoffmann, ph.d., is doing now at hoffmann's website.  on this page you can find a transcript of dr. e. michael holden's account of what happened to him after he left the primal institute.  carol mither's book, therapy gone mad, identifies case histories from janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against the center for feeling therapy.  simon ( )  thanks, simon - why can't you create an account like normal wikipedians complete with a talk page? i don't think the history idea will come to much, there is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of cgingold's latest analyses on the primal therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. i have already read the michael holden swan song twice - sad case.    you seem to be applying two standards of evidence. the primal therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on arthur janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. last september, i wrote in the primal therapy talk page: will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about stettbacher's method, or the international primal association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? there is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about the center for feeling therapy, erik hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of dr. e. michael holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the ipa convention in 1983. the books by carol mithers and tomas videgård are already referenced in the main article. i have a copy of videgård's book, by the way. also, professor steven rose wrote a one-page account of his research with arthur janov in lifelines: """"as janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures i was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex."""" further down the same page he added: """"i obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, i did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so i suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory."""" having participated in the editing of articles in t"

2c9fb5041bebf96c	0	a	i suppose i will start with this for the sake of further discussion and revelations concerning who the ignoramus is:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semitic_languages   the semites are a significantly greater diaspora than the jewish people. if a person actually read wikipedia or any other scholarly source they would not sound as ignorant.  however, i will conclude that the two individuals in this case, tenebrae and bbb23 that have been conducting character assassinations on a users homepage, while blocking out an individual from using their own account thoroughly displays the gestapo tactics involved, and that it was intended to mean anti-jewish as many others that are not aware of the meaning of the words they use have done and continue to do (hence the definition of ignorance). more to the point, however, is that i am not anti-anything, it all serves a purpose. furthermore, calling someone jewish that is jewish is not an insult.  i am not certain that calling someone jewish that is not jewish is an insult either, but if you consider it to be such than perhaps you should be examining your own condition.  to continue on, claiming that i, or anyone else have ascertained information simply from reading one's chosen handle reveals just how blocked your consciousness is.  how is it that i know this person is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ashkenazi_jews  and you do not?  i am well aware of who you are, tenebrae, and that you do know scarlett johansson, like most of us, as she is a very public figure and that you are sexually attracted to her.  i am sure you will lie and say that is not true, but just as there is no shame in being jewish, there is no shame in finding johanssen attractive.

77701	0	a	since they can sense it some time before it happens, they do warn the owner. possibly barking, heavy licking, acting restless, lying on their chest, etc. so the owner may have time to find a cushioned area.  i think it does also depend on the severity of epileptic episodes. i know some people hit their head on the ground very hard and hit things in general, others just have a foamy mouth and stare blankly for some time. so if an owner is prone to serious epileptic episodes, they may have an alarm button somewhere in the house or on them to call for help. service dogs can be trained to hit those buttons. the purpose of the dog is to mainly help the person receive help as fast as possible.

51a2604f4cf984db	0	a	the timeline starts at 1970 because the original article seems to have been written by someone who doesn't recognize the existence of the bronze age (which runs roughly 1970-1985).  the statement that the period begins in the mid-80's was added/changed by someone who does recognize the bronze age.  that's why the inconsistency. what we should do is create a bronze age article and just get rid of the references to 1970 in here.  but it's too easy for naysayers to kill the article by selectively demanding references that aren't demanded for gold/silver/modern.

50693	0	a	"you are asking all the right questions!  first, i want to start with an anecdote from foucault, literally in the preface of birth of the clinic. he describes a case from pomme, who cured a woman with hysteria by making her take 10 to 12-hour baths daily for ten months. the intent was to ""dessicate"" her nervous system and the ""heat that sustained"" by providing an appropriately warm and wet environment. at the end of this treatment, he was membranous tissues ""like pieces of damp parchment"" pass through her urine, including her right ureter. her intestine too, peeled off like a tunic, and passed through her rectum. the same was true of her esophagus, trachea, and tongue -- all these dessicated nervous membranes passing from her body and curing the patient.  he then contrasts this with a description from bayle, giving a detailed description of the arachnoid and dural space in a patient with meningoencephalitis, not fifty years later.  the question that foucault asks is this -- what did pomme actually see? did he truly see a ""damp parchment"" essentially consisting of the woman's internal linings pass from the ureter, rectum, and mouth? i've taken care of some sick patients, and i've never seen anything like that. this is obvious an academic exercise, but i imagine had i examined this patient c1750, i would not have described it in this manner.  i think he starts with this example because it illustrates so very well what he spends a book describing -- that our medical perception fundamentally changes the language that we use to describe things. i think that's easy enough to agree on. more controversially, does a different medical perception actually affect what the doctor sees?  so to get to your question -- i can attempt to answer them with my clinical gaze and a healthy amount of speculation. a ""head full of water"" could plausibly be hydrocephalus, especially if he had tb. tb makes a lot of pus, and can plug the cisterns (the primary reason tb meningitis can progress so rapidly).  how small can a heart get? not that small, but a restrictive cardiomyopathy -- say, from a long-standing tb pericarditis -- can greatly  restrict the size of the heart (http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/cardiology/pericardial-disease/images/figure-3.jpg, warning, it's exactly what you think it is). a complete absence of blood likely more refers to exsanguination, perhaps through some sort of abdominal perforation (again, tb could explain this), with then a delay in autopsy. this is also consistent with the gangrenous bowel.  this is what my ""gaze"" sees when i see that description.  but -- and this is what i was going for with this massive post -- i don't think the answer is that pat. ultimately, the answer of ""what did this doctor see"" is unanswerable, unless we possess a time machine. which is why i think other data points -- especially in regards to his symptoms, and analyzing pedigrees and portraiture, is so helpful, since those are old data points that we can subject to a modern gaze.  does that make sense?"

77472	0	a	i got myself a basset hound when i left my parents home, previously i had a german shepherd which i trained in my teens. their character is quite different, one being a hound and the other a shepherd. on holidays at my parent's i took them both on a hike.   the basset, as per usual tries to go in front tracking small prey ,which he does sometimes, even though i don't hunt, and he just stands there looking at the rabbit/mice when eventually he gets one out of hiding. that day he went and ran way too far.   so i told my long-haired german shepherd to go fetch him, he starts running and cuts right in front of the basset's way looking at him. the small-legged basset stops, looks at him and then tries to pass under the shepherd's watch, the shepherd barks at him and then the basset comes running back to me.   from then on, everytime the basset would look like he would get away from near me,  the german shepherd would run in front of him and bring him back.  genetics and instincts are something amazing.

54060	0	a	after all those “oh gawd, mum no” birthday cake surprises, i’m glad to see one that’s more me. my childhood was awful, i never actually got to celebrate my birthday, closest was one time where they wanted to take pics for family members, so they decked the table with food and made me sit prettily. no birthday party, even today at 28.  if someone would surprise me with a birthday party or even a cake, i honestly think i would cry.  edit: wrote this right before going to bed, and waking up to this was, well, i cried in the bathroom. from kind messages to offers for proper mothering, it’s all amazing, and somewhat overwhelming. i’m not exactly used to anyone paying me any mind, and now i’m crying again.  i will reply to everyone who messaged me, but for the moment i’ll say this: because i live in the netherlands, and nowhere near many of you, i won’t be able to take you up on your offer for a party or being my dj. in this case however, the thought most definitely counts. thank you very much.

80743	0	a	"your story adds up. i know because my dad dealt with something similar. he's a police officer, over 20 years. he said the single most heart warming call he can remember was a special needs man whose bike was stolen. the whole thing started when he was finishing up a call when an adult special needs man walked up to him holding a broken bike lock and looking devastated.   the man said to my dad, ""they told me at wal mart it was supposed to be unbreakable. but someone broke it and stole my bike....""  my dad, at the time, was busy with reports but couldn't turn the guy away. so my dad grabs this guys info and a description of the bike. it was a real tricked out bike too, real unique. guy had spent some of the little money he had to paint the rims gold and just trick it out as much as he could.   once the guy tells my dad where the bike was stolen, my dad already had a hunch. he knew of a homeless guy who hung around the area, did enough to stay on the radar but not enough to warrant any real attention.   my dad tells the guy he'll keep an eye out and if he sees the bike, he'll get it back for him. he gives the guy a ride back to his house and heads over to where the homeless guy hung out.   and sure enough, he sees the homeless guy with the bike. so he whips a u turn but the homeless guy saw him and ducked behind a convenience store, then disappears into a trashy motel area. my dad loses the guy but figures he'll see him again.   so the next day, in briefing, my dad lets all the other officers know about the bike and to let him know if they see it.   later that evening, after the rush hour calls die down, he goes back to where he last saw the homeless guy with the bike. he doesn't see him at first so he swings by a local convenience store for a coffee.....and sure enough, there's the homeless guy with the bike.   my dad goes up to him and asks him where he got the bike....guy gives a spiel about finding it yadda, yadda.   needless to say, my dad gets the bike back.   calls up the owner and tells him to meet him at midnight at the same place he first told my dad about the bike  they meet up and my dad's like ""guess what, i got something for you""  opens up the back of the car, guy sees the bike, and just lights up with happiness. my dad said he gave him the biggest hug before he starts breaking down in tears.   turns out, the special needs guy was taking the dart bus from garland to carrollton for work. for anyone who knows dfw, that's about a 40 minute drive on the highway. and then would ride his bike from carrollton back to garland to go home, usually around midnight after he was off. the dart didn't service the area he worked that late so his bike was the only way he had to get back home. he was worried about his job because his boss didn't like letting him off early enough to catch the dart bus back home.   long story short, even in major metropolitan areas with extensive public transit, it doesn't always work out for everyone. the man was doing what he needed to do to get to work.

56475	0	a	10,872 new yorkers to see their marijuana convictions disappear  by azi paybarahaug. 28, 2019  even as states across the country have legalized marijuana, potentially opening the door to a multibillion dollar industry, the impact of marijuana criminalization is still being felt by people — mostly black and hispanic — whose records are marked by low-level convictions related to the drug.  but on wednesday, new york began the process of expunging many of those records, as part of a new state law to reduce penalties associated with marijuana-related crimes, a spokesman for gov. andrew m. cuomo confirmed.  “for too long communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by laws governing marijuana and have suffered the lifelong consequences of an unfair marijuana conviction,” mr. cuomo said in a statement.  under the new law, which was passed in june and took effect on wednesday, 10,872 people in new york city will automatically have their records wiped clean of marijuana convictions, according to a spokeswoman for the state division of criminal justice services. in the rest of the state, an additional 13,357 people will see marijuana convictions cleared from their records, the spokeswoman said.  sealing these records would ensure that a person’s marijuana-related conviction would not come up in most background checks, state officials said.  a method for expunging the records, which has never been done in new york, is still being developed, the officials said. the process could take up to a year, a spokesman for the state office of court administration, lucian chalfen, said.  the drug policy alliance, a nonprofit group, said the number of people who would have their records cleared could be many times higher than the number cited by the state; the alliance cited figures showing that between 1990 and 2018, 867,701 arrests were made in new york state for low-level marijuana offenses.  under the new law, the classification of the penalty for possessing between one and two ounces of marijuana has been lowered to a violation, and fines have been capped at $200. previously, such possession was a class b misdemeanor. the fine for possessing less than one ounce of marijuana has been lowered to $50, from $150.  the move to reduce fines and clear people’s records has been embraced by advocates of criminal justice reform, many of whom said criminal penalties for using marijuana fell disproportionately on black and hispanic residents.  khalil a. cumberbatch, an advocate who was pardoned by mr. cuomo in 2014 after serving time for a robbery conviction, said in a statement that expunging marijuana records “gives people a new lease on life, removing the suffocating stain of stigma that prevents so many from reaching their highest potential.”  state senator zellnor myrie of brooklyn, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he hoped lawmakers will build on this “first step.”  “i represent brownsville; that was ground zero for a lot of this,” he said of marijuana enforcement. expunging records “is just the beginning of the state recognizing the errors of that war.”  in february, a study from john jay college found that “blacks and hispanics consistently had higher rates of arrest for misdemeanor marijuana possession compared to whites.”  kevin sabet, director of smart approaches to marijuana, an advocacy group, said he embraced expunging low-level offenses, but not full legalization.  “we don’t want people in prison for marijuana use,” mr. sabet said. “but the criminal sanctions on marijuana is not a reason to commercialize and normalize marijuana.”  mr. sabet said he wanted to see marijuana possession likened to driving over the speed limit. “it’s something discouraged,” he said, “but it’s not something that is going to destroy your life if you’re caught doing it.”  new york began decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana in 1977, one of the few states to take such a step at that time. in 2014, the state legalized a medicinal marijuana program with restrictions that reflected mr. cuomo’s apprehension toward the drug; for example, smoking and eating the drug are prohibited under that program.  today, more than 30 states allow medical use of marijuana. eleven states have legalized the adult use of marijuana. last year, the district attorneys in manhattan and brooklyn stopped prosecuting cases of marijuana possession and smoking in public.

582a0e3cb139534b	0	a	"""   well, i'll give you my opinion. i wrote the intervals section, and i admit that i didn't write it well at all. it was one of my first wiki contribs, and it sucked quite honestly. i would encourage someone to re-write it if they want to, or i will when i have time to mull it over and do it properly. however, as far as the specific point over whether it relates to the article: harmony cannot exist without intervals. when two distinct (by which i mean different) pitches are sounded, the interval between them is what creates harmony. harmony and interval relationships are inseparable, because they're one and the same. so absolutely, a section explaining intervals is relevant. however, the way in which i went about explaining it in my contrib wasn't so great. again, i would encourage a competent and learned musician to do a re-write, or wait and i'll do it.     i will say one other thing, which is that wikipedia is a learning reference, and will serve its best use to the public if average joe can come along and glean complete information from non-confusing articles. my ideal is this: say a churchgoing person, one who has very limited musical knowledge, wants to learn how to sing the alto/tenor/bass/whatever line in hymns, so that he/she can feel more """"one with god"""" on sunday mornings. i want for that person to be able to look at this article, and come away with a clear idea of how harmonies work, so that he/she can practice singing them. the oneand onlything which creates the alto, tenor, and bass lines are the fact that they're pitched at an interval to the melody (soprano) line. again, intervals and harmonies are one and the same. for the large percentage of the population who struggles with learning things """"by ear"""", a comfortably firm understanding of interval relationships is (along with practice thereafter) the magic key to unlocking the ability to """"hear"""" (discern) harmonies. that's why i think it's important to keep the section in question, but to rewrite it.

c51e064f7ce0aa70	0	a	"""i can't offer an offical document either, that the classical language category was introduced by a constitutional decree, but there are many notifications, that are not published on the internet, like the official notification, that tamil was declared """"classical language"""". however, there are newspaper reports, which confirm, that the classical language category was introduced by constitutional decree. so this is enough to prove it:  http://www.deccanherald.com/content/aug142008/editpage2008081384442.asp  also i found a conversation of the indian parliament, which illustrates the importance of the classical language status for india, where mr. shivraj v. patil compares the status of the scheduled languages to the status of the classical languages:  shri janardhana poojary: sir, the demand for declaring kannada as a classical language is pending before the government since 2004. the same answer has been given earlier also. my submission before the house is that the kannada text and recorded history belongs to 252 bc. the first kannada literary work kavirajamarga was created in 850 ad and it refers to some writings earlier than that. the 12th centaury kannada bhakti movement in the form of vachana or oral expression is unparallel. in contemporary kirtana which subsequently became karnataka sangeet is an enduring contribution to indian music. sir, the epigraphical material in kannada, numbering over 25,000 inscriptions in stone and copper, are rich in style and contents, which are not found even in tamil inscription. the unesco records kannada amongst the prime scripts of the world. sir, kannada is among the first living languages of the world in the history of continuous writing system spanning three millennium like hebrew, chinese and tamil.  shri janardhana poojary (contd): sir, the recognition was given to tamil. we do not grudge it. now, sir, when the world recognises kannada, in india...  mr. chairman: please, put your question.  shri janardhana poojary: ...step-motherly treatment is being given to karnataka. agitations are going on in karnataka. about three days back, about one lakh people gathered. everyday, it is going on. has the government recognised this? is the government going to take any action on this, and by what time?  shri shivraj v. patil: sir, kannada is a very rich language, ancient language. the matter is before the committee of linguistic experts constituted by the ministry of culture. this matter is now with the ministry of culture. they are looking into the matter. there are demands made by one other section of the society with respect to their language. now, these demands are being looked into by the expert committee, and after the expert committee comes to any conclusion, the ministry of culture will take a decision in the matter.  shri janardhana poojary: sir, in reply to unstarred question no. 1381, it was stated, """"the ministry of culture had received presentation from various quarters for declaring kannada as classical language. a committee of linguistic experts has been constituted to examine the claims of any language classical language status. this committee will advise the government in the matter."""" this answer was given on 6.3.2006. subsequently, to me also, the minister of culture has replied saying that it has been referred. now, the question before the house is as to how long it will go on like this. there is a limit to the patience of the people also. they are losing their patience. you may not believe, but they are condemning and criticising the parliamentarians and saying that karnataka m.p.'s are dormant; they are inactive.  mr. chairman: please, ask the question. don't make a statement.  shri janardhana poojary: how long will the government take a decision? after being referred to the expert committee, there has been a lapse of one year, what action is going to be taken by the government?  mr. chairman: mr. poojary, this is a supplementary question. please, ask the question. don't make a statement.  shri shivraj v. patil: as a matter of fact, this question should have been sent to the ministry of culture. but, because, the notice was given to us, and the notice was given at the last moment, the question was accepted and we are replying to it. as a matter of fact, it is only the ministry of culture which is in a position to take a decision with respect to this, and i would like to say that the language should unit; language should not divide. many languages in our country are rich languages and they should be a source of our unity rather than division. so, it would be necessary for all of us to tell our brothers and sisters in the states that on the basis of language, division should not be created. because the languages are rich; because the languages are ancient; because...(interruptions).  shri janardh"

3c1f2ca817e03e7e	0	a	"""   really tangled paragraph   the conception of a right to something that implicitly creates an obligation on someone else to provide that thing (a positive right) is widely challenged.  you can not enforce your wish for something (under the auspices of a right) if it implicitly constitutes an obligation on another to do something for you.  however, one person's right to something creates a negative right in that you have the right for that thing not be interfered with by another, and that other is obligated not to interfere with your right to it.  the obligation test is widely used to determine what constitutes a right.  to illustrate: you have the right to own an axe, but you do not have a right to an axe.  if you do own an axe, others have an obligation not to steal it.  i've got a post-graduate education, and i had to read practically every sentence of this paragraph more than once to parse it. and it has a lot of problems beyond that:   normally we avoid second person. i don't see why it is needed here.  """"widely challenged"""" with no citation: i have almost never seen this challenged except by liberatarians. i'm pretty confident that most people, for example, consider that the right to life extends to the point of creating an obligation for a government or society to attempt to rescue victims of a natural disaster. i would doubt that there is a """"widely"""" held belief that a person dying of thirst while someone next to him had abundant water could be reasonably expected to die respecting his neighbor's property rights.  by the second sentence, this has switched to imperative (or, more precisely, hortatory) mode, which is entirely inappropriate. it becomes a statement of a narrowly libertarian conception of rights, in the article's narrative voice.  again """"widely used"""" without citation. i cannot name a country where this, in general, has the force of law. certainly not the u.s., one of the more libertarian countries in the industrialized world, but one which recognizes a right to a publicly financed primary and secondary education.  in short: poorly written libertarian cant.   i'll allow at least 48 hours (and probably more) for someone to rewrite this in a way that belongs here, but if it hasn't been substantially fixed by then, i intend simply to remove it. -  | talk """

c568afce26e24fea	0	a	nice to meet you, 92.xx. you ask some very good questions. i'll be glad to answer them. -) one of my great passions in life is learning about a broad variety of different topics: computer sciences, physics in a general sense, world history, geography, biological life, etc. but above all else, i am extremely passionate about human rights. in the most general sense, i support freedom for everyone, regardless of their life situation. with regards to most of the causes that i support, not only have i taken the time to read about them on the side, but i've also followed news developments pertaining to them very closely. for example, i oppose the ruling family of saudi arabia because of their hardline islamist ideology and authoritarian methods. to start with, i consider saudi arabia guilty of gender apartheid against its women, who aren't even allowed to leave the house without wearing an abaya and being in the company of a male consort. it's the only country in the world where women are not permitted to drive. they are also known for severely discriminating against expatriate workers from throughout asia and africa, abuses against the shiite community in the eastern province, and publicly beheading people for nonviolent offences — they literally still perform executions on charges of witchcraft and sorcery. and that's just the tip of the iceberg in a laundry list of reasons why i detest the saudi monarchy. what makes it worse is the fact that there doesn't seem to be any outrage over their human rights record, which deeply troubles me. granted, i don't think saudi arabia is a controversial state to denounce. some of the ones i've listed are no-brainers to most people: a free burma, the end of totalitarianism in north korea, etc. but then there's the more divisive issues, such as kosovar independence or the syrian civil war. i have been following the latter since before the uprising even began in march 2011; already very familiar with the human rights situation in syria, i was fully anticipating the arab spring to arrive there sooner or later. i also knew it would be far more complicated than any other arab country, if for no other reason than for the fact that it has a society divided along sectarian lines. i support the downfall of bashar al-assad. i believe that he and his regime have committed large-scale crimes against humanity for the sake of retaining power (yes, i do think he deployed sarin gas in ghouta). however, unlike many others, i do not see opposition to assad as being mutually exclusive from opposition to al-qaeda and its affiliates, including its syrian branch al-nusra. they too have committed atrocities, specifically against the christians and alawites. the long and short of it is, i support a free, democratic, and secular syria. easier said than done, but it never hurts to be optimistic. now, kosovo is an entirely different story. the region has a very complicated history, especially during the existence of yugoslavia as an independent state. i'll spare you the lengthy explanation of the context, the situation after the breakup of yugoslavia, the guerrilla war conducted by the terroristic kosovo liberation army against ethnic serbs, the resulting ethnic cleansing campaign against the kosovar albanians conducted by the regime of slobodan milosevic, the un presence in kosovo, the 2008 declaration of independence, etc. all you need to know, as it pertains to my support of kosovar independence, is the fact that the vast majority of people in kosovo support it. everything else is immaterial to me; it's what the people want that i care about. the issue of kosovar serbs should be resolved through negotiations between serbia and kosovo. those are just two examples of my less popular stances. asperger's syndrome is considered a pervasive developmental disorder on the autism spectrum. at its most basic, you could say it is simply a mind form of autism — but that in itself would be a drastic oversimplification of what is a very unique condition. every case is different, and i have a particularly mild diagnosis. most people would never guess that there was anything different about me. it's more in the negative way that i would oftentimes interpret subtle nuances of socialization. for example, if i overheard two people having a conversation and discerned my name, i'd get nervous and assume that

68018	0	a	"^ this. being too nice and too passive can still hurt your social life, without also having to be some sort of secretly manipulative monster.  edit:  speaking from my own experience as a former nice guy, i had no real sense of what healthy assertiveness looked like. i didn't want to be like one of those ""pushy assholes"", so i went to the opposite extreme - i tried to be the nicest, most laid-back person possible. i listened to classical music instead of rap. i watched anime instead of ""trashy reality tv"". i prided myself on being ""different"" from mainstream culture. these things weren't bad in their own, but looking back i realize that i was trying very hard to be the opposite of what i saw most of my peers doing. i never pushed for sex - hell, i had no idea how to present myself as a sexual being. i had only one tool in my toolbox to relate to girls - niceness - and didn't understand why i was so unsuccessful.  i don't think that most ""nice guys"" are trying to play some weird mind games to get sex. they are trying their hardest to attract a romantic partner, but lack the social skills and self-awareness to do so in an effective, healthy way. they approach dating like how you would try to win over a romantic partner in a video game: ""if i say enough nice things, give them enough gifts, and never say the wrong thing, eventually they will fall in love with me.""  edit 2:   i've had a few people ask me how i've broken out of the ""nice guy"" mindset, so i wanted to write up some of the things that have been helpful for me. in all honesty, i still struggle with being a people-pleaser. it's something that i'm continuing to work on, particularly conflict-resolution. i've had some painful but instructive life-experiences that have helped me to break away from my old mindset. therapy has been extremely eye-opening, and i wish that i had sought it out a long time ago. my wife is also extremely helpful: she can instantly tell when i'm being ""fake-nice"" (aka people-pleasing), and she pushes me to prioritize being authentic. here are a few lessons that have been extremely helpful for me:  * ""niceness"" often comes out of place of fear, not genuine kindness. i was nice because i was afraid of people not liking me. i was **avoiding disapproval**, not earning approval for who i am. in reality, niceness was actually impeding me from having the kinds of relationships that i wanted, because i was afraid of being more authentic.   * my self-worth is not dictated by other people's opinions of me. in fact, people tend to like me more when i'm my real self, not who i think they want me to be. people are attracted to authenticity, and they can usually pick up on ""fake niceness"".   * my wants and needs are just as important as anyone else's, but i need to communicate them. refusing to express myself will create false expectations for the other person, and can eventually lead to pent up feelings of unfulfillment or resentment.    * ""nice"" is different from ""good"". sometimes being nice is actually unkind - it can be false or inauthentic. trying to make everyone happy often results in doing more harm in the long run.     * sometimes it's okay to make other people upset or disappointed. it's often better to be upfront about what you can and can't (or will and won't) do, rather than make false promises. when you set healthy boundaries and stick to them, people tend to respect them in the long run. if they habitually violate those boundaries, then that's a pretty good sign that they would have walked all over you if you if you hadn't set those boundaries.   * it's okay to be rejected. my particular brand of niceness comes out of a fear of failure and rejection. being nice allows me to minimize my vulnerability, but also prevents me from taking necessary risks. i've had to learn that it's okay to get rejected. it's okay for people to not like me all of the time. this has freed me to focus more energy into the people and things that matter most to me.   lastly, i'm going to plug a podcast that i think really nailed these concepts: ""shrink for the shy guy"" did a great series of episodes on niceness called ""not nice"". the first one is [here](https://www.shrinkfortheshyguy.com/not-nice-what-nice-really-is/). the speaker used to have social anxiety himself, and the way he explored those ideas really felt spot-on to me. i'd highly recommend checking it out.   i hope this helps!"

72576	0	a	i'll give the question some thought over the weekend if a new thread pops up, /u/sammythemc.    as for the pirate incident specifically, whatever unease we feel about its veracity, we don't have to attribute it to augustan propaganda.  capture by pirates is plausible enough; clodius is also reported to have been captured by pirates, for instance.  how caesar comported himself during his captivity might be invention, but it needn't be later invention meant to justify an augustan regime.  if we believe just the minimum of the story, that caesar was captured by pirates, ransomed, and then killed all the pirates, the only person to report on caesar's captivity is caesar, and i think it's easy to see why a young politician who had already escaped sulla's death squads might spread the report of his bravado in dangerous company.  other young men performed similar stunts - pompey raising his own troops to support sulla, and demanding a triumph, for instance.  there might be something about the source of the report that inclines us to suspect augustan fabrication, but i'll have to look more closely, and for that i will wait for the potential new question.

(also, this is minor, but wikipedia admins are no different in terms of article approval than any other editor. i am also an admin, but that just gives me the ability to work on more technical aspects of the project).  you are welcome to expand on the article as it is now, but it would be preferable to do it by gathering information from the many third-party sources listed.  the article is very well sourced, but not very much of that information is brought into the article.  as for the list of project management software, with such a relatively short list, it is inappropiate to have several links to the same family of products.  i don't know a way would satisfy your concern, other than to suggest to put the link in the best place you see fit. in the future, it might be worthwhile listing separately the desktop and the web-based products, but not while there is only enough information for one article.  again, please remember the primary focus of wikipedia (see what wikipedia is not), which is to bring neutral information, not advertising or promoting.

65756	0	a	the density of the water remains pretty much unchanged from the change in pressure. water is often considered incompressible because no naturally occuring pressure differentiall will cause water to expand to a significant degree. what will change is the actual mass of water in the lake. the pressure will draw more water to the low pressure area if the lake is connected to another body of water, the ocean in the case of katrina or from the other side of the lake of it is big enough. this is like sucking water through a straw. the water moves up the straw but drains it from another source. also, regardless of whether not the lake is attached to another source, the water will go up simply because the low air pressure means there can be less water vapor pressure (dryer air). so the air outside of the eye is very wet (obviously) but the air in the eye is not. the decreased pressure means thinner air and thinner air cannot store as much gaseous water. so the air that was previously very humid in the higher pressure areas can no longer hold all of its water resulting in the water vapor condensing back into a liquid. this isn't on the scale of rain, but enough to contribute towards the amount of water in a lake.

65994	0	a	yes, you are right. experiments on snakes found they absorbed 60% more calories from cooked food when compared to uncooked, and humans as similar.   but it also depends on the foods themselves. some, like milk, eggs, fruit and many more are pretty much the same, cooked or uncooked. plants and meat yield more nutrients and energy when cooked - eg a raw carrot is nowhere near as useful than a cooked carrot.  humans have a significantly shortened gut when compared to what it 'should' be, and that is likely driven by obtaining more calories by cooking. this shortened bowel in turn frees up energy we would otherwise be spending to digest for our brain (or so a really interesting theory on human evolution goes). in short: cooking allowed our brain to expand.  edit: but note that this might not extend to this scenario since the bread was already milled to flour, fermented and cooked. all those processes make it easier for us to extract calories. toasting might not add anything here, and certainly does reduce calories fractionally by burning sugars and starches we would otherwise digest.

'free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. one would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article francesco carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now """"deleted"""" comment. especially the section on the """"dutch media controversy"""" is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of peter veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van hooff. this section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. furthermore, we the populares, the people's front of rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. if user:slrubenstein does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. in any case, we fail to see why slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal wikipedians. we also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority. so in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator—there certainly must be one around here—to remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors. in order to prevent tedious unfruitful edit wars we suggest to discuss changes to the article on this talk page first. —   """

71791	0	a	sort of.  to be clear, overall education rates have gone way up - more people are getting bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and phds now than were historically. this is not such a good thing for bachelor's degrees - only about a third of jobs require such, but about 2/3rds of young people go to college, and about half of them are getting degrees. this is resulting in the value of college degrees dropping and inflation in what degrees people are asking for for jobs - there are lots of jobs that ask for bachelor's degrees now which really don't need to, but can because there's an excess of them.  however, on the other hand, in recent years, college attendance has leveled off a bit as a result of this.  we've seen a modest decline in overall college attendance in the last few years, but [we've been seeing the largest drop in low-income people going to college,](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/25/study-finds-drop-percentage-low-income-students-enrolling-college) and low-income people were less likely to go to college to begin with.  but you asked about education. this, too, is so; children of more educated families are more likely to go to college.  contrary to what many people might expect, this is not an american trend; in norway, we've seen the same thing:  > [and what happens is that — even though it’s essentially free — only 14 percent of children from the least-educated families in norway go to college, compared to 58 percent of children from the most-educated families, according to an analysis by a norwegian education researcher, elisabeth hovdhaugen.](http://hechingerreport.org/in-norway-where-college-is-free-children-of-uneducated-parents-still-dont-go/)  interestingly, this bottom-end rate is indistinguishable from the bottom-end rate in the united states (13%), suggesting that it is primarily cultural factors, not economic ones, which control college attendance.

f1dfec6c9fe04ca6	0	a	i have just read the source. i think you are very right. it is about global health but again not about medical tourism which is a subcategory of globalized healthcare driven by the patient movement. for example the reference article starts with the example of dave who had traveled to tanzania as a part of global health rotation. in this case, tanzania is neither the medical destination nor the developed country with collapsed or collapsing social health care system therefore no interest to medical tourism studies. it is clearly not relevant to the medical tourism. i think if medical tourism would be defined with economics terms such as imports and exports (by the way i do not like it in this way, just to clarify), we might not be so confused. like developing countries (medical tourism destinations) are the exporters and the developed countries are the importers. i would suggest to remove such texts and references which are out of topic, even though some of them are quite interesting for other studies.

66152	0	a	"for dark matter and ordinary matter, we basically measure the *total* matter first (since it all gravitates the same), then differentiate between the two using a second effect.   the total matter (23%+5%=28%) is roughly given by the ratio of heights of the first and third peaks in the [cosmic microwave background angular powerspectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cosmic_microwave_background#/media/file:powerspectrumext.svg) because the third peak mostly evolved (by gravity) when the matter content of the universe was negligible, and the first peak mostly evolved when the universe was matter dominated. so the third peak is kind of a calibrator letting the first peak tells you how much matter there is.  to differentiate just the ""ordinary matter"" part, you can get that from the cmb too, but an even cooler way is by measuring how much of various atomic elements there are in the universe in little pockets that appear to have been pristinely left from the big bang. in these pockets, you see that something like 24% of the atoms are helium-4. the amount of helium-4 formed by the big bang depends really sensitively on how much ordinary matter there was, i.e. the ordinary atoms that are the building blocks of helium. run the math and that 24% number tells you about 5% of the universe is normal matter. then 28%-5% and you get the part which is ""missing"", i.e. dark matter.   as for dark energy, well we've just measured how much matter there is (i actually cheated a bit above, those things tells you the total amount of matter, not the percentage relative to everything), so we can calculate how much all that matter gravitating in on itself should slow the expansion of the universe. then you go and measure the expansion and find, lo-and-behold, not only is the expansion not slowing, its accelerating! using supernovae as beacons to precisely measure the acceleration rate, you work out how much dark energy there is, giving you that 72% number.  there's probably like 10 other ways to measure these things than what i just described, cosmologists are constantly looking for new ways to do so and comparing the answers against each other, in hope to find a crack in the model pointing to some new things we don't understand!

73285	0	a	"not a woman, but i can speak on behalf of my experience with my wife.  we have two kids and there's just some really obvious reasons why our sex life struggled for a while.  * after having kids, women gain weight.  and while i still found my wife attractive, i think it hurt her self-confidence and feeling of ""sexiness"" or desirability.  so her sexual appetite was diminished.  i think mine may have been at a subconscious level as i could see that she was not as attractive for a number of reasons like weight, her general attitude, her grogginess, etc.  (i tried my best to alleviate, but only so much i could do). * after having kids, the body takes a bit of time to recover.  for several months after child birth, we needed lube even for vaginal sex, which we never needed before.  she wanted to have intercourse, but the body was just not cooperating at a biological level. * if you have kids, you realize that kids prefer mothers at night.  this seems to make biological sense because the child spent 9 months inside of the mother and of course, it is the mother that can breastfeed a child in the middle of the night.  so the consequence is that for a few years, the child will refuse anyone at night except for the mother.  in this case, some times my daughter would wake up crying.  i'd go into her room to comfort her and she'd scream for mommy instead.  so my wife got much less sleep than me, which affected her mood, her weight, and her health.  i hang out with my 8 year old at night now, but my 3 year old still wants mommy. * additionally, kids really don't sleep through the night until they are about 18-24 months old. * once you have kids, it really diminishes spontaneity; we can't just have sex because we gave each other sexy looks and we're in the mood; we have to get the kids to bed first so sex ends up like a routine and that's not fun for anyone.  so now we plan getaway weekends, but of course, it's expensive.  we have to find ways to kind of break up the monotony. * we keep things very balanced in terms of household responsibilities, but i can imagine that this is a problem in some households where the husband doesn't participate in day-to-day chores.  so we cook together, we clean together, etc. but i can imagine that in some households, this is a big turnoff for women when they are doing all of the household chores.  prior to having kids, i'd say my wife's sexual appetite was about the same as mine.  during and after kids, it diminished greatly (and perhaps that stronger sexual appetite before child rearing serves a biological purpose of leading to child bearing).  there were some months where i honestly felt like i was living a celibate life.  now that my kids *actually sleep through the night* and my wife has been able to drop a lot of the weight she gained, our sex life is definitely better and she initiates much more.  i think in my wife's case, the ability to sleep through the night and feeling more self-confident about her body after weight loss helped her regain her sexual appetite.  that our kids are now more independent also helps as we can leave them with sitters for a weekend and have some adult time.  moral of the story: kids -- don't have them unless you really, really want them."

72617	0	a	"to give a short answer: while these early forms were similar, segregation of performers both by music producers and american society in general, contributed to a divergence in genres, though blues continues to be an incredibly important influence on country  early on in the history of american music, you're correct that what evolved into country music borrowed heavily from especially blues and gospel, as well as other forms like tejano and cajun music. it is also important to note that these genres also borrowed from each other. similar themes and songs (trains, the legend of john hardy, etc.) appear all across what could be termed folk music in the 20's and 30's.  potentially the biggest industry-produced effect that pushed along these schisms was the distinction between white and ""colored"" artists early on in recording history. music by black artists and marketed for a black audience was ""race music,"" while music by white artists and marketed for a white audience was ""hillbilly music."" other music forms you mentioned that were popular within hispanic and latino communities were recorded but, since the bigger artists in those genres sang in spanish, those styles had little popular appeal until the latino population grew later in the century. my knowledge of early latino music is a incomplete so if i am wrong, please correct me.  the blues-country schism was also reinforced by segregation and the institutionalization of both genres. early in music recording history, it would've been unusual to find an artist of either race who sang only country or only blues. but the broad local appeal of the sounds led to commercial success, and of course there were forces which wanted to capitalize on that success. the wsm barn dance started in 1925, but its name soon changed. in 1927, while introducing african american harmonica player deford bailey, announcer george hay called the program the ""grand ole opry"" for the first time, and it would eventually become the dominant stage in country music and end goal for aspiring country artists. i have no knowledge of the ryman auditorium, the opry's home, being segregated. however, it is likely, though hard to determine, that small-time black country artists had reduced appeal due to the jim crow laws of the states they performed in, which contributed to the appearance of country as being white.  the two genres also developed differently and diverged. blues gave birth to jazz. a jazz-infused country styled called western swing was born in the 40's. the grand ole opry became able to determine what styles would get national exposure. in a way, what the opry said was country was what became country. by the mid 40's to mid 50's, this was honky tonk. this was a sound that was blues-influenced but not similar to blues the way old hillbilly music was. still, in the honky tonk era, blues had a tremendous impact on country music. hank williams, a white country music star (one of the legends of country music), learned guitar from a blues musician. but the blues forms that impacted country no longer had appeal to the urban african american in post-great migration chicago and it would take the electrification of the blues to reintroduce it as a popular form. later, the country music establishment purposefully changed styles to a mass-appeal nashville sound which kept little from the honky tonk style immediately preceding and had little visible blues influence, so even the older blues players had little interest in mainstream country anymore.  there have been black artists who have been influential in country music, but it wasn't until the 60's, with ray charles releasing an album of traditional country songs and charley pride becoming the first black performer on the grand ole opry since deford bailey's firing in 1941. however, the introduction of outlaw country, whose performers sometimes released songs glorifying the south, which was sometimes tied to the civil war, understandably turned a lot of black listeners away and towards other sounds like funk, disco, and what would eventually become hip-hop.  black country artists exist today, but the location of country's center in the south, the harsh jim crow laws in much of country's market, the controversial inclusion of the confederacy in some styles of country, the early industry-driven distinction between blues, country, and other folk music, and the shifting interest of black audiences away from both country and blues, led to country being a white-dominated genre.  pbs i believe recently did a nice miniseries called [american epic](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/american-epic/) that explores a few different artists of the 20's and 30's across a broad range, including country, blues, tejano, and hawaiian.  this is also like my second answer on here so let me know if i can do better. it's nice to see american folk musicology get covered.  edit: thought i might add how fitting this question is for the theme, as i generally consider the 1940s to be the time where blues and country significantly diverge stylistically."

73734	0	a	"i have a hard time with this article because it paints a very limited image of introverts and extroverts as well as behaviour indication someone to be one. and while the cultural aspect is raised the author still relies on western interpretations on how to categorise behaviour as extraverted or introverted:   > indeed, being extraverted can get you in trouble if you’re traveling in a country or culture that regards such outwardly-focused behavior as brash and impolite.   the point is that in those cultures the behaviour isn't considered an expression of extraversion because thats not how extraverted people in those cultures express their pro social attitude - they are *as* extraverted as other extroverts in other cultures but use different outlets. north american extravertive behaviour patterns are not the ""default"" or ""normal"" way of extravertive behaviour (even french introverts kiss their relatives on both cheeks while the most outgoing japanese person would be a little disturbed by that) but the whole article uses examples tailored around that point of view.   >  the ideal person in the “individualistic west” is “autonomous, expressive, and comfortable in the spotlight” (p. 2).   save for the ""comfortable in the spotlight"" part introverted people are perfectly autonomous and they can easily be expressive. introversion does not necessarily mean people don't express their feelings or individuality - not speaking when you don't feel like you have anything to say is an expression of feeling in of itself and it's not right to talk about introverts being quiet in public as a perpetual state of ""wanting so say something"". they are not autists with social deficiencies.   one one hand i'm perfectly okay with the conclusion that ""being yourself"" will lead to more happiness and increase your chances of social acceptance but on the other i think the author fails to show that introverts already possess many of the qualities valued in modern society and tend to sabotage themselves with anxieties from aspiring to behaviour they experience as unpleasant *because*, like the author, confuse being socially able with being extraverted.

66055	0	a	black powder is a low explosive, which means i deflagrates rather the detonates.   what that means in lames terms is explosives are measured in how fast they burn, which is what a conventional explosive does, just at a very rapid speed. so as a low explosive black powder in and of itself is not very destructive when compared to a high explosive. what makes black powder effective is containing it. contain it in a barrel and it will propel a projectile. contain it in a pipe and it becomes a mechanical explosion causing damage by way of the pipe breaking at great velocity do to build up in pressure (think coke bottle shaken then tossed up in the air). because it’s a low brisance (ability to cut) it’s not very effective at damaging hardened structures. the main way it would be effective is if it was able to build up enough pressure in the tunnel or building that it was placed it. and other factors like the building materials, amount of earth it was under etc would all factor in. with that, the quality of black powder and amount of moisture as well. there are instances of huge black powder explosions, and instances of not so huge. there would have to be some real study and testing done to say for sure, but what i can promise is that there is no chance it would have gone unnoticed. i hope that answers a least part of the question. i will clarify where i can, if you have questions.

74757	0	a	"thank you everyone-  i never thought this would have such a huge response and it's an incredible feeling!  i have been getting a lot of questions about how i did it and i am going to do my best to explain everything : - - -   so basically i was at rock bottom.  i was in an emotionally abusive relationship, i was self conscious about my body, i was failing college, no good friends and i had nothing that i was really passionate about.  it really depressed me to imagine living the rest of my life this dissatisfied and unhappy.  i constantly daydreamed about being a different person, and one day i decided i would do what it took to change everything i could.   usually when things went wrong i would blame everything but myself and it was really important that i went back through some painful life events and reanalyze maybe what i could have done differently.  for example, i blamed my friend for the end of our friendship but looking back i realized i was actually the shitty one and probably deserved for it to end the way it had.  i made a list of the aspects of myself and my life that i wasn't happy with and i was determined to improve.    at this point i had already dropped out of school at my university because of the combination of poor grades, poor attendance, and lack of passion for my major.  i had always wanted to be a nurse but always told myself i was too stupid to try it and that it was way too hard for me.  it scared the shit out of me but i found an accelerated lpn nursing program that was only 12 months (hondros school of nursing) and i applied for the next available semester.  i worked my ass off studying and sometimes i would drive to class crying my eyes out because i was scared shitless but no matter what - i told myself i would not give up.  and i even failed a semester... but on march 1, 2018 i got my nursing license :-)   ontop of this, i had to remove all the toxic people out of my life.  since i was someone with low self esteem and desperate for validation, i had a couple people who were only around me to take full advantage of me and my kindness.  this was difficult, but i had to put myself first and remove them from my life because it was the best thing for me.  i also gave up drinking and going out to the bars for a while because i knew it would be the best decision overall for me.    it was a lot of faking it because i had always been a pretty negative person.  i just had to force myself to redirect my thinking to positive or just avoid the mirror if i knew i was having a bad day.  i worked really hard on improving my skin and hair as well as my style and makeup routine.  it was a slow process, but it all began to come together.  i had eased up a lot on myself and i started to pick up new hobbies (like painting) as i was learning more about myself and being kinder to myself.    and this is my favorite thing i started doing that really helped improve my life : i got a nice pretty journal and on each page i wrote out a list of 10 goals that i wanted to accomplish that week.  i picked things like ""call mom"" ""go to dinner with ashlee and enjoy yourself"" ""attend all lectures"" ""clean apartment"" ""50 squats 3 times a week"" ""read 20 pages of a book"" etc.  just things that i knew would improve my overall life and health.  i made sure that i only wrote down goals that were realistic because if it was on the page- it had to get done that week (if not, i move it to the next page for the next week).  also, every month i reflect in the journal.    -- hope this helps!!"

72620	0	a	"pretty much on point. the recording industry noticed those black blues players very early on, and some even tried to get them on record and make money off of them, but never really succeeded.  blues music wasn't even known as blues untill 1912, with hart wand's dallas blues. before that is was pretty much known as ""race music"". music by black people, for black people. the way the music was marketed at the time, same for the whiter musics, very much reflected the social state of society. there was a very big divide between blacks and whites in society, so it made sense to keep the music seperate aswell.   this caused the primary players in music (ie, billboard magazine) to treat blues very much like a commodity. something merely to sell people. it was advertised in their magazine as music that ""rings the race register for both of these sides"" (billboard magazine 01-02-1947: 165), which slowly evolved in more neutral reviews like “while the recordings may sound dated, this only adds to the charm of the package” (billboard magazine 15-07-1972: 32) or “it's ollie shephard singing his own true love blues and psy day blues, a small band paving the way rhythmically at a moderate tempo” (billboard magazine 17-01-1942: 64).  the authenticity of the blues players themselves, the authenticity of their music, the ""lived"" sounds of their music started to become an important point of reviews about their music. in other words, their race started to get a more positive connotation when associated with their music, while it really started out as an argument not to listen to it because ""it's music for the black joints"".  now in this 40's the emancipation of the black people in america started to get along quite nicely, and it is easily discernible that from around this area the legitimitazion of blues as an artform started to be accepted more and more by a increasingly broader audience. the blues artists themselves got more people to show up to their gigs, suddenly white people started to show up. in the early 60's there was a massive blues boom in england, mainly by the post-war generation, that wanted to distinguish themselves from their wartorn parents and grandparents. this bluesboom was instrumental in bringing to light a lot of the blues artists, and really, making them famous. several of those hadn't performed a single song in dozens of years, like mississippi john hurt who recorded nothing after his first couple of sides in 1928, only to be rediscovered in 1963 by a blues enthusiast from england. so goes the story for several of those blues artists, who were simply tracked down and thrust into the limelight by their adoring english fans.   the increasingly positive relations between the black people and white people caused a process called ""isomorphism"" to take place. the basic idea here is that a less popular entity will copy things from a more popular entity to somehow become more popular itself. the blues musicians started taking progressively more things from the popular music at the time in an attempt to get their music more accepted in the mainstream. interestingly it wasn't the blues musicians mimicing the more popular folk or country music that caused them to really get their music legitimized, but as i described in the previous paragraph it was mainly the alreayd established players discovering this whole new music and basing their sounds around it. they started to mix in characteristics from blues in their own music, which in turn caused blues to get legitimized as an art form.   my favorite story about this whole process of the legitimization of blues as an art form involves the first time b.b. king performed for a primarily white audience.   > i was booked into the filmore west. now we used to play the filmore all the time, but it was then about 90% black. but this time when i'm booked to go into the filmore west, i come up there, man, and they had about five or six stairs that led up to the doorway. and it was long-haired white people, men and women, sitting body to body going up to the door. so my old bus pulled up, and i told my road manager, ""i think they booked us in the wrong place. you better go in there and check it out."" so he went in, and he found the promoter, bill graham. bill came out and said, ""b., this is the right place."" and i said to myself, ""oh god, what do i do here?"" but he came out and got me.   >    inside the filmore auditorium, people were sitting down on the floor. there were no chairs, tables - everyone sitting on the floor, but they seemed to be very calm. you know, nowadays you'd be trying to step over, step around, and some guy looks at you, ""man don't step on me."" they didn't do any of that. they would just bend over one way or the other and let us pass. and i went to the same old dressing room where we used to go, and i'm as nervous as a cat when a dog's around.   >    when bill brought me to the stage, [he gave me] one of the shortest and best intro's i've ever had. he said, ""ladies and gentlemen…."" everyone was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. ""i bring you the chairman of the board, b.b. king."" everybody stood up and i cried. that was the beginning of it.

' talkcontribs    ah, i had missed that you had said mao's art of war, not sun tzu's.  still, mao never wrote a book called the art of war.  the el norte press edition is a compilation of four separate treatises.  they would be notable individually, but none would be linked to the art of war disambiguation page since none of them shares that title, nor could the el norte edition be advertised on any of the articles devoted to one of those four treatises (e.g., on protracted war). ' talkcontribs    there is a difference between editions that on their own satisfy the requirements of wp:n and the insertion of information about a specific edition into articles about a book.  a more specific notability guideline is available at wp:nb.  since the art of war (disambiguation) is not a heavily-edited page, leaving this to another editor to correct does not seem likely to resolve this problem.  if you like, you can request a third opinion, which would bring others into the discussion.  ' talkcontribs    thanks for your note.  while anything written by mao zedong would count as notable, a collection of his writings, assembled under a title that he never chose, would not be.  it is for this reason that i am loathe to include the art of war as one of mao's writings or to put it on the disambiguation page.  one thing that caught my eye was your claim that this work is referenced in scholarly papers.  that would be a sign of notability.  did mao ever publish these works together as unit under the title, the art of war? who has discussed the works by this title? ' talkcontribs    thank you again for your comments.  the fact that this edition appears in the footnote of an unpublished paper does not make it notable; blogs are not reliable sources, either.  you mention that this book is used at west point.  i would correct you to say that this edition has been ordered by the west point bookstore; the book in question does not exist — except as a creation of el norte press.  you mention your expertise:  expert editors addresses this issue, so we don't have to throw our credentials on the table.  if you wish to pursue this further, the link for a third opinion is above.  '''''' talkcontribs    art of war by mao zedong dispute   summary of third opinion:  any works attributed by mao zedong (mao tse-tung), not already indexed specifically should be considered notable and deserving of a reference line, as long as they are verified. the editor asking for the inclusion has made an argument for notability. the art of war community should decide on any future postings regarding this book.  i have re-installed the reference to the art of war by mao zedong (mao tse-tung) on the art of war disambiguation page. this is the only dispute in queue a"

ca41d8b7afd2fda7	0	a	perhaps then, the way out is to find a wp:rs that says that these christian sources may be inflating the figure. then the article could quote the higher figure (some christian sources say that the proportion of christians may be as high as 15% but according to xxxx these numbers may be inflated). or, if the source (the one claiming that the christian sources are unreliable) then it would be ok to drop the higher number and relegate the info to the religion sub-article. however, failing an external [wp:rs]] confirmation of the motivations of these 'christian' sources, it is wp:or to state that 'it's in the interest of these christian sources to overstate their numbers'. at best, it is as speculative as 'the egyptian government allegedly being interested in promoting a lower percentage of christians because of its troubles with islamic fundamentalists', which, btw, i did not say is true or even my view, i presented it as a counter hypothesis to the speculation of biased christian sources. the point is that we can't speculate about motives because we don't do wp:or. we need to look for external sources to guide us on the veracity of information out there. if we can't show that a source is unreliable, and the source is reasonable, we should present their statistics with the appropriate caveats.

72590	0	a	"kim macquarrie's ""last days of the inca"" and john hemming's ""conquest of the inca"" are both excellent, they were my favorite and most colorful explorations of the matter when i was reading about the inca for work and also the most in depth. both explore in differing ways the role that native allies played in helping the spanish conquer the inca, although it is not truly their focus.  /u/pachamcamac is probably more qualified to speak on andean resources and he wrote an excellent comment with detailed resources that deserves more attention [elsehwere in the thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/affur9/machu_picchu_was_never_discovered_by_the_spanish/edzsrbg) you may find it insightful. i am not an expert on the inca, i had to become an amateur one for a work project.  the cliff notes would be that, more than the military exploits, the spanish did a masterful job of exploiting weaknesses at the foundation of the incan empire. those weaknesses grew from its explosive rise from a kingdom under pacha kuti (there are myriad spellings of his name) to an empire in the way which almost all empires are built, through the conquest of other peoples. the inca maintained their empire through a system of (forced) marriage and, from at least some historian's perspective, continued, ritualized terror of their conquered peoples. their name for their ruler, ""sapa inca"" itself hints at the deeply familial aspect of its government - inca (or inka) is the familial name of the supreme royal family of cuzco. calling it the incan empire as compared to the cuzcan empire would be similar to calling the roman empire the ""julio-claudian"" empire - . sapa inca, the name for the ruler, just means ""the only inca"", i.e. the patriarch of the inca family.  the inca were excellent conquerors but, as omar bradley quote fabulously puts it, ""amateurs discuss strategy. professionals talk logistics."" more than anything, the inca's ability to construct roads in the rugged andes to support and transport their large armies was immensely important to their conquest of their neighbors, who were often at similar or in some cases (from what i recall reading) arguably more advanced states of development, such as [the moche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moche_culture) (those same roads were invaluable to the spanish in time).  after conquest, the inca imposed taxes, which included their religion upon native peoples. this religion, which, to the extent i have read, was in many regards not dissimilar from neighboring cultures in its religious/military/political aspects or utility, but became something of a sticking point with their conquered people, and i've read different commentaries arguing that it wasn't simply imposed as a religion, but became a tool of state sponsored terrorism to keep conquered peoples pacified.  the incan taxation system was unusual (not for the americas but in most other cultures) in that, along with ordinary tribute/taxes (jewels, silver, livestock, etc), it included a human taxation. human taxation has actually been pretty standard throughout time and actually existed in other cultures as well, it took the form of mandatory work time: at a certain time in the year, communities were expected to  send workers to maintain the roads, bridges, and forts that were so essential to the incan military - just, to give a sense of how amazing these roads were, [the incan ability to transmit information via the chasquis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chasqui) is mind boggling in a society that had no horses and was in many parts mountainous, and that messenger system was a product of the roads, waystations, and forts that the incan military supported through tax tribute and built by those mandatory labor taxes. but there was another kind of human taxation, a kind of state terror program in which the children of foreign polities like the moche linked above, were sent to cuzco to be ritually killed.  the inca do not seem to have practiced human sacrifice to the scale of the aztecs, and there is some indication that certain sapas outlawed the practice at various times, but they [archaeological work shows they definitely did practice it in what they called capacocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capacocha) consistently over time, even if not continuously, and it was aligned with the inca sapa - if he fell sick, or if one died, there would be sacrifices, and people knew where their children were being sent. and what a strong reminder of who your conqueror is - ""the king fell sick, we are gonna need a few more of your kids to replace the ones you just sent us we had to kill to bring him back to health, the empire appreciates it"". what is interesting, you'll note from that wikipedia link, is that a. the translation is ""royal obligation"", i.e. a tax, b. most of the children came from outlying (more recently conquered) territories.  the spaniards were appalled at this, as many people today would be. one of the (many) ways the spaniards persuaded natives to aid them was by promising to lower taxes, which included ending the sacrifices. now, what is much less clear is if the natives understood this in the way the spaniards meant, which was ""by forcefully converting everyone to catholicism as subjects of the spanish crown"" or more as ""we will help you conquer your inca oppressors and now they will have to give you tribute"", because, as i mentioned, human sacrifice was pervasive in pre-colombian america and it was part of many local different religions, and people don't generally participate in religion without believing it. i saw little evidence in my reading that any historians think the andean people saw the practice as bad per se, only that it was not great to be the one footing the bill with your children - quite the opposite would be my interpretation. the resistance to catholocism and some of the fascinating fusions of pre-colombian ritual and catholocism, such as the parading of the saints in a similar manner to how the mummies of sapa incas were paraded, indicates to me the answer is that people believed this religion and didn't exclusively see it as a political tool, even if it was also used as one. i think the difficulty spanish priests had in filtering pagan aspects is a clear indication that people were not angry about the religion itself and probably expected to continue the practice, simply by reversing the roles of who gives capacocha.  something macquarrie emphasizes in ""last days of the inca"" is a pretty good microcosm of the questions around ""to what extent was taxation and human sacrifice a thing the natives were concerned with in helping the spaniards?"" it's the question of the truth of post-conquest writing by the descendants of native people: those who were literate were often mestizos who found themselves targets for suspicion as native sympathizers by spanish governors/anyone with an [encomienda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/encomienda), but as the children of spaniards they also were often in positions where they stood to be quite powerful and wealthy if they could prove their loyalty to spain. some writers were very denigrating of native religion even while speaking very highly of other truly impressive achievements such as the engineering feats of ollantaytambo, which could not have been completed without the system of taxation that also happened to include human sacrifice.  today (in america at least) i think it’s fair to say we are much more open in our discussions of the cost of colonization to the native people, but i think a misconception has arisen that people at the time universally thought what they were doing was just. undeniably some/many did, but one of the tragedies of the post-conquest restructuring is that there were spanish contemporaries who, if not initially, eventually recognized the cruelties pizarro, the conquistadors, and the [encomienda system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/encomienda) were inflicting on the natives in the effort to stamp out any trace of human sacrifice or paganism. those complaints were taken seriously by the spanish crown initially and were simply ignored in the colonized places because, well, latin america is very far removed from spain, oversight was limited, and the profits of killing so many indigenous people were so immense that, in some of the same sense that we today look the other way toward labor exploitation in poor countries, people were willing to look aside at how awful the replacement system was for the natives. [bartolome de las casas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bartolom%c3%a9_de_las_casas) comes to mind as a complex person who generally agitated for change. i cannot recall which resource or whose account it was i was reading, but one of the grievances against the spanish crown in the post-inca environment by later peruvian writers was that the spanish had secured native aid on the promise of reduced taxation, only for those natives to find that once pizarro had settled into power, even though they had stopped the ritual kililng as a form of taxation, far more were dying of the commercial labor tax being exacted to work as slaves or in royal silver mines."

65923	0	a	">longer generations would make a species adapt slower to environmental changes, which may also be a weakness.  this can be seen easily when comparing humans and bacteria. the ability reproduce quickly is the reason bacteria become resistant to so many things so quickly.   it's also the reason we don't rapidly adapt to bacteria.  it's partially because we already did. the development of the immune system was the adaption to bacteria.   it becomes interesting when you look at how fast bacteria reproduce in proportion to humans.   e.coli for example reproduce every ~20 minutes or so. if we give ""modern humans"" 100k years of existence then it only takes e.coli a short time to go through the same amount of ""evolution"" to an environment as humans did in 100k years.   even if the numbers are off by quite a bit, a sludge puddle of e.coli will ""evolve"" as much as humans have in 100,000 years in a few months. 1 hour for e.coli is roughly 60 human years of ""evolution"" (assuming 20 year generations in humans). so by the time this post is a day old the e.coli on your food will have had 1440 human equivalent years.   it gives an interesting perspective on the microbiological world that inhabits and surrounds us.

82600	0	a	first off, let me acknowledge that it’s strange to learn, as an adult, that you don’t know how to do something basic like drink out of a cup. i know what you’re going through. i’ve been there. still, hear me out.   for years, i could not understand how my wife was able to drink tea while it was still hot enough to burn tile. i’m talking liquid magma that i could hardly hold, my sweet wife would happily sip away at, with no apparent ill effects.   one day we both ordered a cup of tea and after seeing her start drinking it immediately, i assumed it was safe enough and promptly burned the hell out of my tongue on the still flaming satan piss in that cup. as i nursed my now-blistered tongue, i asked my wife how much asbestos she had eaten as a child in order to allow her to chew burning coals like that.   she looked confused for a second and then said “you can’t suck your tea like your lips are a straw, you need to draw in the top layer of tea using your top lip like a lasso.”  i tried it, and it changed my life. seriously, just tilt the cup so the drink is level with the rim, rest your upper lip on top of the (scalding hot) liquid, and pull it in, bringing a little tea with it. the evaporation cools the very top of your drink quickly enough to make it drinkable. if you suck from lower down or pour it into your mouth, you will burn a hole right through your face.

8111f9aad0257248	0	a	, 7 june 2009 (utc)  you could take your images with a black background and remove it using photoshop or gimp. you're probably right about oso4, although it is possible to show  a bit of packing. not necessary though, molecular structures are mostly about the molecule! i respectfully disagree that space-filling models are less desirable than ball-and-stick models. graphite intercalation compound is a prime example! you can see the way the potassium atoms prop open the graphite layers. both styles are complementary - although in some cases, one may be much clearer.  thanks for adding the reference to file:rutile-unit-cell-3d-balls.png. i've updated the image description. i think it's important to give the source that was actually used for the image, rather than any convenient reference that seems to say the same thing. sometimes there are differences or mistakes in sources that we don't notice until later.  you make a good point about noting atom colours explicitly. i will start to do that in my image descriptions. it's not always practical, though, to add a caption. chemboxes are a notable example. and often, it is easy to deduce which atom is which colour, e.g. phosphorus pentafluoride!    12:20

65905	0	a	"other responses have gone into what makes an individual long-lived. this post will address the question as op phrased it: what determines the lifespan *of a species*? and what's the deal with human longevity?  many people have a concept of aging that could be described as the ""wear-and-tear"" model. basically, the notion is that as you go through life, you accumulate nicks and dings from macroscopic scars and stretch marks to accumulating microscopic injury and dna damage. eventually it's just too much and you run down. *it turns out this concept is markedly untrue, at least at the species level*.  drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, has been the workhorse of many experiments, including those studying longevity, life-history theory, and evolution. many years ago, researchers working with flies did an evolution experiment. they selectively bred fruit flies for longevity, and in a remarkably short time they had flies with dramatically longer life-spans than is the norm. these flies weren't evolving novel genes in just a few generations, rather, they had recombined existing alleles in ways that lead to longevity. the important thing to note is what happened when these long-lived flies were re-introduced into a 'normal' population. did these super-long-lived flies thrive? no, quite the contrary. within a few short generations, any sign of longevity had disappeared. in competition with their 'normal' counterparts, they were immediately outcompeted. (i tried finding the original papers, here's a [modern replication](http://www.pnas.org/content/97/7/3309.full) of these sorts of studies, with more precision.)  what these researchers discovered was that while longevity is perfectly possible, and within the realm of already-existing genes in most populations, this potential isn't realized *because of trade-offs*. increased longevity is exchanged for decreased fitness in other areas. perhaps these long-lived flies in nature would be less likely to evade predators, have more difficulty finding food, or are less likely to find a mate. everything has a cost. note that this is different than the 'programmed' idea of death, that your genes have predetermined a time of death for you. in the life-history model of aging, it's not that dna 'wants' an organism to die, far from it - it's just that other traits (that hurt longevity) are more directly advantageous to the propagation of genes, and so combinations of genes with these traits out-survive and out-reproduce the combinations that lead to longevity.  the immune system gets interesting. unless something else kills it first, it's all but inevitable that an animal will die of cancer. the ticking clock of mutations accumulate, eventually leading cells to proliferate out of control, breaking internal apoptosis mechanisms, evading the immune system, and eventually killing the host organism by hogging the lion's share of nutrients and energy.  what exactly is a 'cancer resistance gene' or a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? why would anything evolve a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? that doesn't make sense, and they don't. rather, it's a gene that is perilously close to breaking something important, if it mutates. *redundancy* is an important concept. if you have 3 copies of something important, you're more or less ok if 2 of them break. if you only have 1 copy, you will be in trouble quickly. animals that tend to be long-lived, such as elephants and whales, tend to have many, multiply redundant copies of genes involved in important functions like apoptosis and immune regulation - the sorts of genes that when they break ~~tend to cause~~ are no longer able to stop cancer.  humans don't seem to have nearly enough multiply-redundant copies of these sorts of genes to explain all of our longevity, while it might contribute somewhat. we don't look like elephants or whales in this respect. this sort of evolution towards longevity would reasonably be expected to take a relatively long time to evolve, as many duplication events would have to happen, and then spread through the population.   it seems humans are probably like the flies that were selectively bred specifically for longevity. in humans, the [grandmother hypothesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/428128a)  conceives of human longevity as something that is directly advantageous to gene propagation ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grandmother_hypothesis) introduces the concept well). it's a sort of grandiose kin selection, where elderly humans in prehistoric times were still able to contribute to the survival and reproductive fitness of their children, grandchildren, and extended relatives. unlike other species that experience a rapid deterioration after their own ability to reproduce goes into decline (such as salmon after spawning), humans *could* contribute into their later years, and so longevity was selected for. maybe we're not so unlike our experimental flies after all."
