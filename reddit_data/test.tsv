496b3dd023e0b62d	0	a	"""  hi, everybody. i just stumbled by this little edit war, and would like to make a few suggestions. as this article stands, it's a jumbled mess. i believe that marie is correct, in that some semblance of encyclopedic structure needs to be used in this article. i have great respect for logger9's expertize in these subjects that so greatly interest me, and his willingness to back everything up with a source. however, to logger9, i think a liitle guidance may be helpful in composing a proper encyclopedia structure. encyclopedic writing is not like scientific writing.  to make it simple, an encyclopedia needs to be written in a journalistic format. the most important information is delivered as quickly as possible, in the first few sentences. this is done using the fewest amount of words possible, and should written so even a child can make snese of it, (at a 6th grade level). we call this the """"lede,"""" and the only purpose of the lede is to answer the question, """"what is a liquid?"""" it should be no more than a paragraph or two.  on a subject such as this, an """"intro"""" section would be appropriate. this is just an expanded lede. this may seem a bit redundant, but is actually extremely useful. some people coming to this article will know absolutely nothing about science, and don't want the feeling of being thrown into a college level class head first. the intro should be written at about a 10th grade level, explaining the scientific aspects in the simplest of terms. (imagine you're teaching a 10th grade science class. how would you explain it to them?)  then, the following sections should get into college level explanations. it is perfectly acceptable to describe well established theories, and the histories behind those theories, but be careful to make it brief. the article is meant to answer the question of what a liquid is, and should not stray into the history of liquid theory. also, when giving theory, realize that a scientific theory is really just a very well thought opinion, and should be attributed to its source. under no circumstances should we combine theories in a way that might lead the reader to a third conclusion, unintended by the original sources. nor should we give the impression that any theory is somehow absolute truth.  also, you will find that most readers want information to be in its correct place. i have seen instances in the past where information was copied and pasted directly from one article to the next. this sort of redundency is usually unnecessary. it's better to add a link to the article where the info is most relevant. and, it is also very distasteful in writing to copy, even from oneself. if it is absolutely necessary to have the same info in multiple articles, then the writing should still be original. the goal is to make articles succinct ... to fulfill the readers curiosity about a subject and only that subject, but to link to any related subject that may further the reader's knowledge. by using this format, it helps satisfy everyone's curiosity before they become bored and move on.  to marie, i'm glad you explained that english is not your first language, because at first i did think the tone was a little harsh, but now it makes sense. i think logger9 has some very useful contributions to make, so i'd love to see a discussion on how to incorporate them into appropriate places. i'm fascinated by the science, and would love it if we all could work together to make it understandable to all. (i'm sure you both are far more knowledible than i am.) to everybody, please use your edit summaries! there are many people watching, and edit summaries save us all alot of time.   """

b5c6724821ca3e38	0	a	i believe running a pdp-10 (real or simulated) and matching the original programming environment would produce the most accurate representation for the original adventure. i have a simulated pdp-10 running (see my url above) with session logs on how to set this up. however, the matching old version of the pdp-10 operating system and fortran compiler crowther used are unknown and may be lost. a pdp-10 with later os and fortran still compiles and runs crowther's and crowther's/wood's code as is, and all print terminal input/output can be logged. below is crowther's adventure (see build-adv0.txt) as it would have been printed on a pdp-10's hard copy terminal: .run adv31  welcome to adventure!!  would you like instructions?    yes somewhere nearby is colossal cave, where others have found  fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumored    that some who enter are never seen again. magic is said     to work in the cave.  i will be your eyes and hands. direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  (errors, suggestions, complaints to crowther)     (if stuck type help for some hints)      you are standing at the end of a road before a small brick  building . around you is a forest. a small   stream flows out of the building and down a gully.      go in you are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.  _ the font, and maybe the command to start the adventure program, may differ with the true original hard copy. i think the print out may be the more accurate representation. since, that was how crowther wrote and played the game?

(maybe ani is a better place to report his rudeness) his first revert did happen several days ago without rationale for his removal of the part. after his revert was challenged today, then he declared to contestants to accept either his inclusion of other cases or exclusion of fujimura. in my point of view, that is a very unwise way to cooperate with others who disagree with his edit because he can't own the article and demand others to follow his own rule. in the ongoing dispute, i got several inappropriate threats by him, and he even lied about my edit. so, i want admins at least give him a proper warning. if amagase keeps to degrade my dignity and fact, he should deal with the consequence anyhow. appletrees (talk)

1875b70bd36df6fa	0	a	p.p.s. i'd like to quote wikipedia blocking policy, as per the blocking policy page:   explanation of blocks  blocking is a serious matter. the community expects that blocks will be made with good reasons only, based upon reviewable evidence and reasonable judgment, and that all factors that support a block are subject to independent peer review if requested.    notifying the blocked user  administrators must supply a clear and specific block reason which indicates why a user was blocked. block reasons should avoid the use of jargon as much as possible so that blocked users may better understand them. administrators should also notify users when blocking them by leaving a message on their user talk page unless they have a good reason not to. it is often easier to explain the reason for a block at the time than it is to explain a block well after the fact.  when implementing a block, a number of pro forma block reasons are available in a drop-down menu; other or additional reasons can also be added. users can be notified of blocks and block reasons using a number of convenient template messages—see category:user block templates and wikipedia:template messages/user talk namespace.

66325	0	a	most vets offer it before any anaesthetic but it's up to the owner if they chose to go ahead. many diseases are underlying, i.e they show no clinical signs. pre-op blood work helps to identify contusions which would make anaesthesia life threatening. in young, apparently healthy dogs and cats, there are congenital conditions such as a hole in the heart, kidney dysplasia, liver shunts etc that wouldn't show up until the body is put under stress, such as anaesthesia.  for instance an apparently healthy dog might have a vein left over from when it was in the womb that bypasses the liver (a shunt), reducing oxygen supply to the organ. when anaesthetic drugs are given this puts an extra strain in the liver to break down the chemicals and it fails to compensate. this means the drugs stay in the system much longer than they should, or build to life-threatening levels. a simple test pre-anaesthesia will show the liver under strain, and more investigations can be performed to determine whether the dog is safe to undergo the procedure.

ff3bda963eb1fed7	0	a	my dear courcelles – you might take a moment and let mr. sensei48 know that you monitor all my postings; needless to say, it’s superfluous for him to forward them to you.   i’m sorry to see you’ve misled this graduate of notre dame on the matter of my conduct – or misconduct. i’ve never denied that my record at wiki is rich with demerits; both custer and reno (especially reno) were masters of the demerit at west point. no dishonor in that.   my advice to sensei48 is to form a skirmish line, and hold that position. do not retreat to the timber. neither should he order a “charge to the rear”: that way disaster lies.   i include the rousing “notre dame victory march” to help inspire you to defend your remarks of  may 5, 2011:  rally sons of notre dame sing her glory, and sound her fame raise her gold and blue, and cheer with voices true, rah! rah! for notre dame.  we will fight in every game strong of heart and true to her name. we will ne'er forget her and we'll cheer her ever, loyal to notre dame. chorus: cheer, cheer for old notre dame wake up the echoes cheering her name, send the volley cheer on high, shake down the thunder from the sky, what though the odds be great or small old notre dame will win over all, while her loyal sons are marching onward to victory.  bon courage!
58303	0	a	i remember hearing my daughter's heartbeat for the first time when i went in for my first ultrasound.  that's probably the instant i fell in love with her.  i don't know if it would normally bring me any comfort to hear her heart beating in another person's body, but she told me once that in the case of a fatal accident, she hoped they could salvage her organs in time to help someone else live longer.  she was so passionate about it, which makes me think that her gift of love to a complete stranger would somehow bring me solace.

eddfceee2f25f160	0	a	well yes it is repetitive, but that's because some statements are not addressed. in such  discussions one should speak about the facts (not about the individuals) but one should also listen  no i don't want to include the actor model in gr as you say (i have said this at least 3 times).yes hewitt sounds cranky at times, but as far as the category itself he's got a point. my only comment was that the category relativistic information science is meaningful (see my comments above). whether you or anybody else in gr doesn't like it, that's another matter. the category is called relativistic information science (not gr information science). the only other person on wp who asked me about my credentials was a crank on a rather infamous discussion on bell's theorem. for whatever it's worth to you, i have a (not recent) phd from harvard. i do research in quantum information although i am pretty knowledgeable in pde's and c*-algebras (of course without authentication there is no way to prove this so this somewhat pointless).  do you seriously think that i would be participating in this discussion if i didn't know about the difference between gr and sr?  anyway this irrelevant, since arguments should stand on their own.

9a23ccdc30e19263	0	a	"""   hungary during the holocaust -the kastner train                the 1955 kasztner libel case: the verdict of judge benjamin halevi. the state of israel claimed that malkiel grünwald's allegations against kasztner were a lie. when grünwald published these accusations, the israeli government did rather more than demand that his views should not be broadcast. because a prominent zionist official (dr. kastner was a spokesman for the ministry of trade and industry) was involved, the attorney general of the state of israel prosecuted grünwald for criminal libel. let the verdict of judge benjamin halevi (who later became one of the panel of three judges that tried eichmann) in israel's district court of jerusalem speak for itself. the attorney general v. malkiel grünwald this material should be studied carefully. the masses of jews from hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the deportation trains without knowing their fate. they were full of confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to kenyermeze. the nazis could not have misled the masses of jews so conclusively had they not spread their false information through jewish channels.  the jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the nazi or hungarian rulers. but they had trust in their jewish leaders. eichmann and others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead the jews. they were able to deport the jews to their extermination by the help of jewish leaders. the false information was spread by the jewish leaders. the local leaders of the jews of kluj and nodvarod knew that other leaders were spreading such false information and did not protest. those of the jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were persecuted by the jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'. the trust of the jews in the misleading information and their lack of knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be deported to the gas chambers of auschwitz led the victims to remain quiescent in their ghettos. it seduced them into not resisting or hampering the deportation orders. dozens of thousands of jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few dozen police. yet even vigorous young jews made no attempt to overpower these few guards and escape to nearby rumania. no resistance activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos. and the jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities. the same jews who spread in kluj and nodvarod the false rumor of kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn their own people against the misleading statements, the same jewish leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of deportations . . . these same leaders did not join the people of their community in their ride to auschwitz, but were all included in the rescue train. the nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of extermination permitted rudolf kastner and the members of the jewish council in budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends. the nazis did this as a means of making the local jewish leaders, whom they favoured, dependent on the nazi regime, dependent on its good will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. in short, the nazis succeeded in bringing the jewish leaders into collaboration with the nazis at the time of the catastrophe.  the nazi chiefs knew that the zionists were a most vital element in jewry and the most trusted by the jews. the nazis drew a lesson from the warsaw ghetto and other belligerent ghettos. they learned that jews were able to sell their lives very expensively if honorably guided. eichmann did not want a second warsaw. for this reason, the nazis exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the jewish leaders. the personality of rudolph kastner made him a convenient catspaw for eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their task easier.  the question here is not, as stated by the attorney general in his summation, whether members of the jewish rescue committee were or were not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the s.s. chiefs. it is obvious that without such s.s. nazi patronage the jewish rescue committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an underground. the question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the nazis interested in the existence of the rescue committee? why did the s.s. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the jewish rescue committee? did the exterminators turn into rescuers?  the same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent jews by these german killers of jews. was the rescue of such jews a part of the extermination plan of the killers ? the support given by the extermination leaders to kastner's rescue committee proves that indeed there"

""what kung fu did you learn? what did they teach you?"" his family asked, eagerly. ""they didn't teach me anything,"" he mumbled. ""oh, you are so modest, tell us what they taught you!"" they urged. the man grew enraged. ""they didn't teach me anything!"" he shouted, as he slammed his palm on the table, breaking it in half. "

[correct]""""  i think the important part of the guideline is what i italicized. i think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn't matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the """"incident"""" section. take a look at the example given in the guideline—air florida flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article air france flight 447. both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. i don't think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. it's also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as """"crashed"""", per wikipedia policies. taking into account what i said, here is a proposal for the lead:  if an official would just refer to the plane as """"presumed crashed"""", then the following could be added as a second paragraph in the lead:  thoughts? a good compromise?

(those consequences to seem like they would be rapidly reversible, however.)  presumably a similar argument could be made about geothermal exhausting the heat within the earth, causing the tectonic action to cease, but that seems a lot further off than wind-based power generation having an impact.  194.59.184.12

d3f5fd7ac71bb657	0	a	wellington metropolitan vs wellington urban   as someone who has lived in wellington off and on for 20 years (i now regard it as my home town):  in all of this one crucial fact is overlooked, the wellington metropolitan area includes the kapiti coast as far as waikanae. there are several thousand people who commute to other parts of the urban area everyday and the suburban rail network goes to paraparaumu, with a planned extension to waikanae. almost everyone i know thinks of the kapiti area as part of greater wellington.  so i am left wondering why the boffins in wellington refuse to include this area in the urban data. yes i know there is the stretch of road past paekakariki, but that's no different from the haywards road or the hutt road. in reality, in spite of the classifications, wellington remains the second largest metropolitan area in new zealand, by my calculation the population including the kapiti suburbs is around 415,000, still around 30,000 more than christchurch.   if christchurch gets to include non-contiguous suburbs (eg halswell, lyttelton), then so should wellington. not only that, banks peninsula was included in christchurch in 2006 so that bob parker could become mayor of christchurch and promote christchurch as the second largest city in nz. the reality is christchurch has an inferiority complex, and i can say that because i'm from there. it doesn't change the fact that wellington has more people and is more important than christchurch, no matter which way the geographers and politicians want to spin it.  instead of merging the pages how about creating a new one for greater wellington, which could include kapiti.

65770	0	a	actually, racial differences have been studied pretty specifically pertaining to nose shape [since the 1800s](http://www.popsci.com/climate-nose-shape-evolution#page-6).  there has definitely been a correlation between flatter, broader noses and equatorial climates, and narrower, longer noses at higher latitudes.  [this study](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006616), for example, controls for genetic drift and found statistically significant differences in nose shape across cultures, varying directly with temperature and absolute humidity.  the [theory](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-shape-of-a-nose/) on this is that narrow chambers are better at insulating the air that is exchanged and warming it up, whereas broader chambers facilitate more open surface contact with greater volumes of air, allowing for more efficient cooling.

79273	0	a	i just had my first real taste in management. about 20 people, i get to run the project my way and at the end of it we delivered a superior product only a week over schedule.  anyway, i walked in expecting to be not like a real boss but like a 'cool boss'. and it was cool. everything was moving steady as we got set up and organized the first couple weeks. identified a problem child right away but was able to mitigate her dead weight in productive ways.   then the honeymoon period ended abruptly, somewhere near returning from lunch on like a stupid day like a friday, and my problem child went ballistic on a new hire on his first day.  when we spoke about it her rebuttal devolved into a half-racist rant and why she shouldn't have to hold their hand on unfamiliar tasks.   so then i'm the bad guy because despite giving my new team the loosest possible amount of leash, one person created a situation that had to go on paper and as a result i immediately had to drop being cool and become the policy enforcer.   the point of the word vomit is my biggest lesson is i tried to be cool but habits of individuals and the pressure of the bureaucracy have this disgusting way of distorting even the most idealist minded manager.

(and, it's reversible with permission logged via an [[commons:otrs| otrs ticket].) as for the suggestion to   from just reading this page, it looked like this had been settled, and the photos are to be left in and photos of members of other groups can be added over time (and there have been multiple other editors providing opinions already).  good.  i would add that images should be shrunk or (better yet) merged, as at [:file:eriamercol.jpg], so that this can happen.  however, i see file:traditional_eritrean_dance.jpg has replaced tigrinya eritrean wedding picture file:eritrea_eritrean_wedding.jpg.  is this a problem?  i don't know the ethnicities of the photographed parties.  i haven't looked through the article's edit history and don't plan do. flickr has lots more appropriately licensed files.  i see file:rashaida_family.png is on the french article, so there are photos available.  re. faytinga photo: i think it should stay. re.  the mayote site seems to be a mouthpiece for a particular set of politicial views, so i don't think it's a reliable source for much other than its own views. (my opinion would be swayed if it had a written fact-checking policy.)  however, given 3 other sources vetrisimino0 says confirm faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  can you accept that, middayexpress?  if not, i still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here. i do wish to point out that a blanket order to a fellow editor like  is highly inappropriate and invalid here! the wp:bold guideline applies to, and allows, such edits.  however, so does the part of bold that guides one as to how to react when one's bold edits are not left in place.  so, in other words, both of you should read / review wp:bold. (i see no argument for an exception to bold.)  so, hopefully both sides will accept my opinions, and move on to edit on other topics within and without eritrea.  there are points where i have agreed with each of you and points where i have disagreed with each of you (two each), and i believe i've been able to be fair and impartial.  hope that helps.(t•c)

bd2367e25694c8da	0	a	"""   comments from rhb   i am approaching this as someone who knows very little about the subject. i will give some high-level comments mainly on structure and content. there are copyediting and prose issues as well, but it is probably worthwhile to tackle the general problems before going into specifics. before i start, one general point that you will see often in my comments is that there are at times new subjects that are suddenly introduced. although wikilinks help, a clause or a few words of explanation would smooth the flow of reading for a person not familiar with the subject.  background to the mission this section seems a little long relative to the rest of the article. unless there is a significant expansion planned for the rest of the article, i would recommend reducing this section. there are small details that do not add very much to the augustine story, e.g., the origin of st martin’s church, the fair-haired slaves theory, the pope writing to various kings. bede is suddenly introduced without explanation.  arrival and first efforts the mission turning back to rome is not explained. is there a significance to what happened? it says “…on the one hand… on the other hand…” but the two items mentioned do not seem to be in opposition as expected when this phrasing is used. augustine established first at canterbury. since he was the originator, it might be good to give a reason why he chose the location. the archbishop of arles is suddenly introduced. who is he? was he based in arles (in modern-day france) or in kent? the existence of an archbishop implies a significant christian population existing on british soil. this then brings more questions to mind. it says """"that christmas…"""". but what year is that? the king became a saint after his death, but the sentence may be in the wrong place. did the king die shortly after augustine's arrival? in the same paragraph, some information of the existence of christians before augustine's arrival is given. this info should go before the discussion of augustine's arrival. mellitus and justus are suddenly introduced without explanation. the sentence """"a theory by the historian s. brechter…"""" is either a run-on sentence or is incomplete.  additional work after the first sentence describing the two episcopal sees, there is a sudden jump to after 1066 and a discussion of a cathedral. how are they linked? also what cathedral is it? the description of the archeology seems out of place in the """"additional work"""" section. is it meant to show that augustine managed to build new churches? if aethelbert was only the king of kent, how was he able to summon bishops outside his realm? there is a sudden introduction of the tonsure.  further success concerning """"temples and usages"""" is that """"temples and their use""""? the """"former… latter"""" construct does not work very well here. concerning the quote """"whoever wishes…"""", who said that?  i would recommend reading the article out loud. i think you will find some sentence structures that seem a bit complex or difficult to understand. following the corrections, a good copyedit/prose check is needed. i give as an example, the sentence """"as to why pope gregory…"""" could be made better as in """"nothing is mentioned in the sources on why pope gregory chose a monk to head the mission"""".  i hope this has been helpful.

72751	0	a	"this is my first lengthy comment on /r/askhistorians, so i hope it fulfills the general criteria.  i wanted to address a specific point of your question which was ""were most of lee's men from virginia?"" though lee was the commander of the army of northern virginia, it turns out that not many brigades of virginians were actually involved in the confederate order of battle. looking at a list of the appomattox campaign, you'd find that approximately 8 brigades of infantry were ""virginia"" regiments. usually an average full-strength infantry brigade could have about 2,500 troops, leading to simple math that suggests there might have been as many as 20,000 va infantry.   but, the math here intuitively seems wrong -- as you might realize, most regiments (constituent parts of the brigade) were already below 50% strength by this late stage of the war. for example, the 34th va infantry regiment mustered out with 466 troops and only surrendered 224 at appomattox. indeed, looking at the rest of the order of battle points to *32* different brigades of soldiers not from virginia, spreading across the confederacy from maryland to louisiana. the amount of virginia infantry is a significant, but not all-encompassing, amount.  interestingly, there were 6 brigades of cavalry from virginia, yielding a much higher percentage of the army of northern virginia's total cavalry force. by comparison, there were only 2 brigades from north carolina (under generals barringer and roberts) and a handful of other southern troopers mixed into gary's brigade from ga, sc, and va.  it is worth noting that the order of battle also has a ""richmond department"" led by ewell that was entirely made of men from va.  though this may not answer every element of your question, it begins to suggest that the overwhelming majority of troops were not, in fact, particularly close to their homes when lee surrendered.  source:   [quick order of battle from nps](https://www.nps.gov/apco/order-of-battle.htm)  more detailed order of battle gleaned from [*official records...*](http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moawar&cc=moawar&idno=waro0095&node=waro0095%3a1&view=image&seq=1289&size=100)  [useful refresher on the organization of civil war armies to help clear up some of the terms that i used](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/civil-war-army-organization)"

59850	0	a	years ago my daughter had to have a tooth pulled and i took her to a special pediatric dentist that sedated her to have it done. she was about 6.   on the way home we had to stop and fill a prescription for antibiotics and we stop at walmart.   she was still a little loopy from the sedation and she was walking very slowly and strangely. she refused to be carried. as we cross the crosswalk, slowly, somebody honked at us. honked!   a man crossing the other direction literally yelled at the driver can’t you see she has a disabled child!   it made me so sad to think that somebody with a disabled child who was walking slow and maybe a little weird would be honked at by a stranger. on a crosswalk.

7accd16a7ed3504d	0	a	"""   pretty badly written introduction.   namely that the writer seems more interested in writing about common law than civil law. while i am sure some degree of comparison is very useful, if not necessary, i don't think that going to great lengts to explain what common law is and then just say """"and civil law is not like this"""" is a very good way of defining civil law.  the 4th paragraph in the intro (the largest one) is the main culprit here. in fact the third sentence in it doesn't even follow on properly from the first two and should logically read pretty much the opposite of what it does. in addition it seems to be be very us-centric: while it mentions english common law, it then goes on to list examples of basic tenets of this which seem to be drawn directly from the us constitution.  so i think it's pretty badly written as an introduction, but as i don't know too much about the subject i don't really want to go about editing it myself."""

3e0cfcfdc9447a90	0	a	"""  page rebuild  for quite some time, the alcoholism entry has provided out of date or incorrect information. i'm in the process of rewriting it to meet contemporary scientific standards for the disease. i welcome external review and discussion.   stuart gitlow md (chief, annenberg physician training program in addictive disease, mount sinai school of medicine, nyc)  thanks for your contributions so far.  you may be interested in creating a user account.  some of the benefits are discussed at this page: wikipedia:why_create_an_account%3f    it greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes, for one thing. -)    good points, and i've created an account as you suggest. see my notes below as well. sg  in response to the commentary at the very, very bottom of this page (dupe social impacts), i've rearranged the content of the page a bit.  i believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism, and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people: definition, effects, diagnoses, treatment, broader issues.  fyi, i renamed the first instance of social issues to read """"societal issues"""" and moved it into the broader issues area.  i moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the """"effects"""" category.  after this edit i'm going to go remove the original note of this (because it's no longer germain), so you'll have to look at the next edit in order to read it.    in looking over the article and the discussion of stanton peele's perspective et al, i'm wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to """"excessive drinking,"""" whatever that is. alcoholism doesn't refer to someone who drinks a lot. many people drink a great deal but aren't alcoholic. conversely, many alcoholics don't drink very much at all compared against the general population's intake.    the section on """"terminology"""" that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding.  since you seem to think it's important, i'm putting it back in.    righto   despite the difficulties that we've had of late, the entry is coming together nicely. i'm looking over the effects section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol use. it is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. the effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (this is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). nevertheless, i wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article. can we build a consensus regarding this area?     alcoholism vs. alcohol abuse   the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism make a difference between one and the other. what i found more confusing is that from """"alcohol abuse"""" you're redirected to """"alcoholism"""".  """"alcoholism, also known as 'alcohol dependence,' is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance"""".   moreover, """"alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, or physical dependence"""", etc etc.  >> getting the facts @ niaaa     response:  good point.  from one interested perspective, aa literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism.   i can't make the correction. i'm not that good informed and my english is quite lousy. could you..?    how about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug addiction? correct me if i'm wrong, but alcohol is certainly a hard drug, characterized by intense (and possibly fatal) withdrawals... isn't that addiction?  this is mostly true.  the root"

5abc3b1e0b44695b	0	a	"""      thermological explanation of galling  hi. i´m responsible for most of the text regarding the galling phenomenon presently found in the wiki archive.   my opinion of the galling phenomenon is the following. galling is highly connected to thermal or pressurized influenced contact and the interaction between the mating surfaces. the temperature or pressure around penetrating objects is higher for small and sharp objects compared to larger blunt objects due to higher acceleration. this means that phase transition can take place even in the initial build up process and onset of adhesive material transfer and galling. it was clear that a change in material behaviour, which increased resistance for further advancement, took place around sharp edges even in the build up process where attached material was insignificant. my conclusion, there is a connection between the attached material and the geometrical situation around penetrating objects and developed pressure and temperature in the contact zone.  the theory about electrolyte and a galvanic exchange is interesting but in my research using a sofs (slider-on-flat-surface) tribo-tester, revealed a clear difference between exhibited contacts found in the tracks after testing. an electrolyte and a galvanic exchange should always be present, which was not observed using the above equipment.   if you are interested in the argumentation read the reference and perhaps include it as a reference in the wiki text about galling.    wallin h. 2008, 129 p: an investigation of friction graphs ranking ability regarding the galling phenomenon in dry sofs contact  (adhesive material transfer and friction), a free pdf document available here or www.diva-portal.org found here or at www.uppsok.libris.kb.se here use search words:""""galling & harald wallin"""" or the direct libris link here"""

50808	0	a	royal participation in battle is a very common and normal thing in history. in many cultures, the main justification of a king's supreme power was his ability to protect his land and people. martial prowess and military superiority was therefore often a key element of royal propaganda. a king who was perceived as weak or cowardly would find little support among his subjects.   our earliest surviving description of a historical battle is ramesses ii's account of how well he fought at qadesh; pharaohs and assyrian kings boasted of how many men they personally killed; the kings of homer's *iliad* fought until they were too old, and then they only talked about how much they had fought when they were younger. persian kings led their armies in person; spartan kings fought alongside their men, and at least 5 of them died in battle; the kings of macedon, including alexander the great, were covered in scars sustained in combat. the roman emperors of the principate (27 bc - ad 284) were army leaders first of all, though this was less true for the emperors of late antiquity.   this very short and very incomplete list covers less than 2,000 years of history, and only for a small part of the world; i'm sure that we could go on forever if we included all eras and all continents.

(for comedy, this can result in, in the morning, laying stone still as one feels that there is a lot of blood inside them....  then the quick leap up out of bed, clutching one's crotch and fleeing to bathroom.)  actions that involve contracting the womb can make more blood come out--as the womb already contracts itself to try and push blood out.  excersize, activity, orgasm and similar can have the same result.  being still can result in blood pooling inside.  every womb-owner has experienced, say, going through a class, and feeling fine in regards to if they need to change their tampons, then standing up, and realizing that no, they need to go now.  but we can't really effect the heavy/light-ness of our period.  we can't control how bad the wound is bleeding, so to speak.  typically, you start with light days, then heavy days, then light days again.  so, again, think of it as a water ballon or something, attached to some flexible tubing.  the water's leaking out at a relatively set rate (that may be light, heavy or anything in between) ... and the water finds all sorts of places to go, and changing the orientation of the tubing can result in pooled fluid being released from the ""tide pools"" so to speak."

71345	0	a	  -  stephen hawking’s 3 favorite songs.   “[symphony of psalms](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwzguo_eoc) was in fact the first piece of music professor hawking ever purchased. “i first became aware of classical music when i was 15,” he said. “lps had recently appeared in britain. i ripped out the mechanism of our old wind-up gramophone and put in a turntable and a three-valve amplifier. i made a speaker cabinet from an old book case, with a sheet of chip-board on the front. the whole system looked pretty crude, but it didn’t sound too bad. at the time lps were very expensive so i couldn’t afford any of them on a schoolboy budget. but i bought stravinsky’s symphony of psalms because it was on sale as a 10” lp, which were being phased out. the record was rather scratched, but i fell in love with the third movement, which makes up more than half the symphony.”   [wieniawski’s violin concerto no. 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=anodabjbt8a)professor hawking was actually inspired to buy a collection of wieniawski’s music after hearing his second concerto on radio 3 in the 1990s, but prefers the first in particular for its “haunting phrase in the first movement”.   [francis poulenc’s gloria](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=reqseqktyya) is the final piece in professor hawking’s musical trilogy. part of the work caused a “scandal” – in the french composer’s own words – when it was first performed in 1959 because of its unusual mixture of light-heartedness and spirituality. poulenc later explained that he had been thinking of frescoes in which angels stick out their tongues and “serious benedictines whom i saw playing soccer one day” when he wrote it. professor hawking first heard the poulenc gloria in aspen, colorado, during the resort’s 1995 music festival. “you can sit in your office in the physics centre there and hear the music without ever buying a ticket,” he said. “but on this occasion i was actually in the tent to hear the gloria. it is one of a small number of works i consider great music.”

[the ""world famous"" florida avenue grill](http://floridaavenuegrill.com/), which bills itself as the ""oldest soul food restaurant in the world"" is undeniably a historical and popular establishment, and also arguably the best known *native american* restaurant in dc that you've never heard or thought of as such.  its founders, the wilson family, are occaneechi (now recognized by north carolina as the occaneechi band of saponi) and i've never heard lacey c. wilson, jr. describe himself in any other way. he's bled for that, but you wouldn't know it unless you were one of the local families. my mother conducted interviews with him, but she has exclusive control of the material, which will *hopefully* not pass into my possession any time soon. the food is fantastic, although i haven't eaten there in years."

71789	0	a	"tldr: yes and no. there is no direct connection between having and education and then getting more education as a result. however, education leads to more money and more money leads to more opportunities for education and more success in obtaining education, both for an individual and for that individual's children. it would be perfectly correct to say that the wealth gap has created an education gap because the american education system is so dependent upon local economies.  -----  sociology professor here.  it can be stated as a scientific fact that [wealth inequality exists in america.](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fpkmaxcwusmc&oi=fnd&pg=pp11&dq=america+wealth+disparity&ots=mfq68urexx&sig=3pdwpch0yimtgca2g2qs8eorvju#v=onepage&q=america%20wealth%20disparity&f=false). it can also be stated as a scientific fact that [wealthy individuals are more likely to graduate high school, graduate college, and obtain advanced degrees](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-eilbqaaqbaj&oi=fnd&pg=pp1&dq=america+wealth+disparity&ots=uusv9owrtc&sig=un3vqnhdi4h_tab14kedeizlrxi#v=onepage&q&f=false). therefore, the wider the inequality in wealth the wider the inequality in education.  however, there is a worse problem that's hidden in that statement. education attainment is not a perfect indicator of how educated a person is. that's sort of counter intuitive, so here is an example:  group a) a poor section of town has low property values which means less taxes that fund schools. this then means that the school cannot hire the best teachers because it cannot pay very well. this means that the education being received by students is delivered by average or below average teachers, that textbooks and campus facilities are more likely to be outdated, and that after-school activities and extra curriculars are more likely to utilize sub-par equipment.  group b) a wealthy neighborhood has high property values which means plenty of funding for schools. they can afford high salaries, so many teachers apply to work here, meaning the school can select the best of the best. they also have money to keep their facilities and extra curricular activities up to date.  now if both group a and group b have a perfect 100% graduation rate, can we say that the students that graduate have the same education? yes and no. they passed 12th grade, but in one situation the academics were more rigorous and the education included more than just the bare minimum. so on one hand we can point to statistics that say america's graduation rates are increasing, so we must be smarter. on the other hand, our schools are getting less funding and in some neighborhoods the curriculum are more lax, therefore the graduation rates increasing may be showing that our schools are getting easier to pass.  some studies have shown that [private schools emphasize critical thought and leadership, while public schools are more likely to emphasize discipline, cooperation, and obedience](http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/wq_vol11_w_1987_research.pdf). is this a disparity? in a way. leadership and critical thought are skills needed in management and entrepreneurial jobs, while cooperation and obedience are more useful in menial labor. this isn't specifically tied to school funding, but it is worth noting that education quality will affect job prospects and success.  lawmakers and policy makers are well aware of these trends. to correct for this, america has the ""no child left behind"" law which forces all public schools to meet at least a minimum standard of education. the problem is that some schools barely meet it, while other (well funded) schools exceed it by leaps and bounds.  some states also have a ""robinhood"" law which takes excess money from wealthy neighborhoods and redistributes it to poor neighborhoods to keep schools from becoming too polarized. these are effective, but not perfect, and i'm not an expert on this area so i'll leave it at that.  however, all of this just says that the wealth gap creates an education gap. so the next question is, does higher education create more education?  for an individual, no. most people seek a particular degree, and then stop seeking education. if education snowballed like the op implies that then we'd have individuals who obtain dozens of ph.d's, and that's pretty rare.  it is common, though, that [educated parents are more likely to raise educated children](http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2005-06518-016) (pay wall). there's a lot of different factors here, mostly having to do with parent's higher education meaning more income and more free time. at the same time, this social fact is why colleges have programs set aside to specifically help first generation college students. people who go to college when their parent's hadn't gone to college are [half as likely to graduate](https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/classroom-resources/first-generation-college-students-graduation-rates/) as students whose parents do have a degree.  in summary, the answer is a soft yes. there is an education gap in america and it is growing, but it has more to do with the wealth gap and school funding than with education specifically."

72428	0	a	"the warren commission formed after the assassination of president kennedy produced [this appendix](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html) on the history of presidential protection. they note that before lincoln, ""there was remarkably little concern about the safety of presidents and few measures were taken to protect them."" this persisted even after president jackson survived an assassination attempt due to a misfiring gun. in the 1840s congress did assign a guard to the white house — but apparently with more of an aim to protecting the building and grounds than its primary occupant.   during the civil war lincoln was guarded irregularly — sometimes by washington, d.c. policemen, and sometimes by army units. lincoln ""was reluctant to surround himself with guards and often rejected protection or sought to slip away from it."" this, the report notes, ""has been characteristic of almost all american presidents.""  the congressional report after lincoln's assassination, ""with traditional reluctance, called for no action to provide better protection for the president in the future."" the warren commission notes that some people at the time saw lincoln's assassination as a unique reflection of the civil war, which was now over, and not something indicative of a need for broader protections. indeed, for more than a decade after booth, presidents continued to walk about in public alone and unguarded. (i remember, but cannot find a source, an anecdote about either grant or hayes, that upon receiving a threat on his life, the president didn't change his routine other than to purchase a heavier walking stick. sadly, you should disregard this anecdote unless someone else can find a source for it, but it's delightful enough i thought i'd mention it as an aside.)  after president garfield was shot, the new york tribune contrasted ""the simple republican manner of life which the custom of nearly a century has prescribed for the chief magistrate of the united states"" with ""the forms and safeguards of courts"" — implying that bodyguards were seen as a courtly, monarchical affectation, where as a republican president should be open and accessible to the people (july 3, 1881, quoted in warren commission report). surprisingly or not, despite the second assassination of a president in two decades, congress ""took no steps to provide the president with personal protection.""  the secret service, initially a group for combatting counterfeiters and financial crimes, first began providing part-time presidential protection in 1894 — apparently a coincidence because a group of colorado gamblers were suspected of plotting to assassinate president cleveland. president mckinley actually had secret service protection when he was assassinated, but it was his death that finally spurred congress to give the secret service ""full-time responsibility for the safety of the president.""  returning to lincoln, he was certainly aware that many people wanted to kill him. president theodore roosevelt later quoted lincoln saying, ""though it would be safer for a president to live in a cage, it would interfere with his business."" he had sporadic guards but no formal protection.  fascinatingly, general ulysses grant was originally invited to attend ford's theater with lincoln on that fatal night. he begged off with an excuse about needing to be with his children, but [possibly because julia grant and mary todd lincoln hated each other](https://featherfoster.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/mary-lincolns-rivals/).   from a [recent biographical article on grant](https://www.damninteresting.com/the-reconstruction-of-ulysses-s-grant/):  > grant would never forgive himself for begging off, certain that had he accepted the invitation, his bodyguards stationed outside the door would have stopped booth. **as lieutenant general of the u.s. army he was entitled to armed protection around the clock. the president in those days was not.**  hopefully this was helpful!"

(they shall come to nothing, like water running forth; and when they go to bend their bows, they shall be made feeble, or weak.)  >8 as wax that floateth away, they shall be taken away; fire fell above, and they saw not the sun. **(like a snail that melteth away into slime, they shall be taken away; like a dead-born child, they shall not see the sun.)**  like the snail, even the best-armored knight will melt away. /u/sunagainstgold is a lot more familiar with this subject than i am; spangenberg's work sticks in my mind."

73322	0	a	"the title of the article is extremely deceptive. there is no actual spike. in reality, the birthrate for teenagers fell by 25% between 2011 and 2015. but, the 3.4% spike over 4 years is the theoretical difference if funding had sustained in texas, calculated by comparing to 2011-2015 data of states that had funding.  in other words, the 3.4% spike is a hypothetical ""what if"" scenario.  i doubt anybody will read this comment, but i read the research paper linked from the op article, and i dug up these statistics:  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr62/nvsr62_01.pdf  on page 8, you see that texas birth rate for teenagers aged 15-19 was 52.2 in 2010 and 46.9 in 2011.  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_01.pdf  in page 6, we see the 15-19 birthrate went down to 34.6 in 2015 in texas.  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_01.pdf  on page 37, we find that most of births for people age 15-19 are between 18-19. the birthrate for age 15-17 for texas is 21.1. the birthrate for age 18-19 for texas is 72.0.  even the reddit op research paper on which the article is based admits the birthrate fell despite funding cuts:  https://www.academia.edu/19435560/family_planning_funding_cuts_and_teen_childbearing  > before 2011 teen birth rates in texas average nearly 69 births per 1,000 teens, compared to 45 births per 1,000 teens outside of texas. *for both groups, teen birth rates fell after 2011.* as such, the analysis below can be viewed as estimating to what extent teen births rates could have declined further in the absence of family planning funding cuts.  the article contradicts itself. it has a summary that claims a spike, but on page 9, admits that the teen birth rates fell in texas after 2011.  so where does the 3.4% come from?  if you take a look at page 33 of the op research paper, they got the 3.4% by calculating what the presumed teen birthrate theoretically would be been if the funding hadn't been cut.  this means that while the texas birthrate did fall consistently between 2011-2015, the researcher claims that it would have fallen by an extra 3.4% if the funding hadn't been cut. it's pure speculation, as you can't rewind time to a parallel dimension to prove yourself right.  so, the reddit title is actually incorrect. there is no spike. just a prediction offset."

65743	0	a	basically. water is gonna follow gravity to the lowest spot. the lowest spot could be a pond, lake, or, for the majority of water, the ocean. water will follow rivers and gullies until it reaches the ocean/lake/whatever the low spot is.  problem with a hurricane is the storm surge, which forces the ocean to rise into the coastline. i know the shear wind force can push it but there may be other factors (for reference, put water on a plate and blow on it. it will move towards the area you blow). so the ocean, where the rainwater normally flows, is now several feet higher, meaning those rivers/streams/gullies are going to stop flowing once they reach equilibrium with the ocean.
51895	0	a	from op:  > **the mammoth bones were broken while fresh.** hammer tools were found near the body. they weren't chewed apart, as if by an animal, they were smashed apart by something with enough dexterity to use a tool. so something was likely using tools to masicate the mammoth 130,000 years ago.  and /u/jeladli:  > paleontologist here,  > **yes, it would almost certainly be evident if these bones had been previously exhumed by early humans.** you have to remember that the rocks that these specimens are found in are the context in which the animal was buried. in that sense, if the sediment around the animal had been disturbed (which would be necessary in your hypothetical scenario) then there would have been evidence of that in the field. of course, there is always a chance that the authors missed this in the field, but i will tell you that most of the people that are involved with this study are extremely good (i.e., anal-retentive) stratigraphers.  > also see /u/brojangles comment on breakage. fresh bone breaks very differently than older bone.

72697	0	a	the problem here is the mismatch between historical armour, which tends to exist in just a few styles without notable differences in effectiveness, and the desire to have a clear system in which the player can level up their equipment. the result is that most games either introduce an arbitrary progression from bad to better armour (usually leather -> linen -> bronze -> iron, or something like that), or introduce fantasy armour. it makes sense from a game design standpoint, but obviously has little to do with historical reality.  this reality, as far as we can tell, is that by the time of the peloponnesian war very few greek hoplites would have worn body armour of any kind. this applies to both sides in the conflict. most depictions of warriors at the time show them with a simple conical helmet and a shield, and no other armour. they would wear a simple tunic in battle; for spartans, the tunic was dyed red. greaves may still have been common, but the only kind of cuirass that would be frequently worn was the linen cuirass known as the *linothorax*, and even this may have been rare. bronze armour had all but gone out of style, and was mostly the prerogative of cavalry, which carried no shield.  i wrote in more detail about the lightening of the hoplite panoply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/5tvsl6/a_question_on_armor_in_the_late_archaicearly/ddpnaqs/).

72490	0	a	"to discuss the 1876 presidential election, let's rewind the clock...  first to the 1860 presidential election, where 81.2% of eligible voters (white men) participated. this heated election was a four-way split with abraham lincoln (republican), john c. breckinridge (the breakaway pro-slavery southern democrat), stephen a. douglas (the mainstream democrat, often referred to as a ""northern democrat""), and john bell (constitutional union, a third party neutral on slavery issues). the electoral college went to lincoln, sealing his victory, but the popular vote was not in his favor (39.8%, meaning 60~% of americans did not vote for lincoln). lincoln's election - and the indifference re: secession from the lame duck president, james buchanan - among *many* other issues regarding slavery - provoked south carolina into leaving the union, followed by several states in early 1861 and the establishment of the confederacy.  next presidential election is 1864 during the war itself. turn-out continues to be high (73.8%) which is  impressive considering the number of white men away from home in the battlefield and the new introduction of absentee voting. as to be expected, there is widespread voter fraud. the union soldiers backed lincoln, though, and he won the day again. the civil war ends in 1865, and lincoln is assassinated soon after. he is replaced by his vice president, andrew johnson, who republicans do not want to remain in power because he was a bit too sympathetic with white southerners and showed bigotry towards newly freed african-americans.  next presidential election is 1868: former civil war union general, ulysses s. grant (republican) against new york governor horatio seymour (democrat). another high turnout (78.1%). it's electoral slaughter with grant winning triple digits against seymour's ninety. but, as with lincoln's 1860 election, grant does have a struggle in the popular vote, where seymour receives a healthy 47~%. this is the first time african-americans, newly freed from slavery, could vote. in contrast, some white southerners had not yet gained back their voting rights from their treasonous turn against the u.s. government. entire states (va, ms, tx) were termed ""unreconstructed"" and had no electoral vote.  next presidential election is 1872: the incumbent ulysses s. grant (republican) against horace greeley (liberal republican, a breakaway party from the republican party). the democrats did not run anyone, throwing their support behind greeley. the turn-out (71.3%) was less high, in part because of the confusion with the democrats' absence and the split republican ticket. still much higher than we see today, which fluctuates in the 50s%. very strangely, greeley actually died during the vote counting process. even more strangely, his wife had died the week before the election, so he spent his few weeks left on earth in a grief-stricken daze.   and finally we get to the 1876 presidential election. presidential elections for the past four cycles had been intense, fraught, and significant for the future of america. you have the spoiler number: 81.8% of eligible voters participated. certainly, by 1876, american men recognized the importance of the presidential election and their individual vote in the race. in particular, there was a real obsession with what would happen between the republican and democratic parties, as they've undergone great stresses in the last sixteen years. yes, the civil war was won, but reconstruction had taken a real toll on both parties. unlike in the 1872 presidential election, democrats decided to run and campaign hard.  our two candidates: ohio governor rutherford b. hayes (republican) against new york governor samuel j. tilden (democrat). incumbent republican president grant decides not to run for a third term, in part because of accusations of corruption in his administration. democrats had not won a presidential election since the 1856 presidential election twenty years prior.  issue 1:  white southerners hated reconstruction. the white leaders of the southern states were sick of u.s. federal forces' occupation and influence on state/local governments in the south. thus, the white south seemed poised to vote democrat. during the 1876 election season, numerous incidents of pro-democrat, anti-black violence occurred, including an ugly series of events throughout south carolina (remember: the first state to secede in 1860). one such event, the hamburg massacre, made it clear to white southerners that anti-black violence / voter intimidation would not be stopped by federal republican officials, leading to more violence and voter fraud on election day. consequentially, resentment towards ""carpetbagger"" northerners and republicans was now intertwined with resentment towards freed african-americans. note that in 1876 (11 years post-war) three ex-confederate states still were under republican governmental control: florida, south carolina, and louisiana. and white southerners hated this ongoing federal reconstruction: it denied them self-government. they wanted it over. the democrats agreed. strangely, so did many republicans by 1876. it didn't matter: the democrats had a stronghold in the south founded on resentment of federal intervention and a rejection of black progress.  issue 2: the civil war was not fully over. many republicans  resented the rise of the ex-confederate back to his full voting rights. one campaign song, [""the voice of the nation's dead,""](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.23702100/) included lyrics such as ""our country from all traitors we must save"" (traitors being ex-confederate southerners) and ""tilden aided treason"" (re: tilden's conservative anti-republican views). republicans contrasted hayes' valorous military service in the union army (he was repeatedly wounded but continued to serve) with tilden's war-time criticism of lincoln and disdain for republicanism. republicans even accused tilden and democrats of [inspiring intimidation and violence of northern men](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.12804700/)  (the so-called ""carpetbaggers"", who brought all their belongings to the south in bags made from carpet) who had relocated south at the polls. republicans ""waved the bloody shirt"" of the civil war, as it was known then.  issue 3: in 1876, the united states was struggling economically. since 1873, the country had been suffering through an economic depression and financial panic, which incited frustration against the incumbent republican party, who many blamed. more people show up to vote to expel the incumbent party when times are rough. (a more recent example of this case is herbert hoover and fdr in the great depression.) so, surprisingly, the democrats have an edge by having not been in presidential power for a while.  issue 4: that strange third party from the 1872 presidential election: the liberal republicans. these undecided men had to find a new home, and the democrats went in for the embrace. they took on the policies of liberal republicans and propped up tilden as their candidate: an anti-tammany hall, anti-corruption honest man. liberal republicans, who had been repulsed by the corruption in reconstruction and the grant administration in 1868 and 1872 terms, were pleased with the nomination. but the republican nominee rutherford b. hayes looked equally as good, if not better, for his life-long dedication to honor and honesty, and of course, this was naturally their home party. when republicans rejected a candidate interested in the spoils system and chose hayes, the party won back many liberal republicans, though notably not all.  issue 5: the swing states - oh the swing states! if you look at [the electoral map for the 1876 election,](https://www.270towin.com/1876_election/) you'll see some states far north have gone blue (democrat). tilden campaigned hard in his home state of new york, and he won it (note: ny had gone republican in 1860, 1864, and 1872). several other states swung democrat that were situated around new york, such as new jersey and connecticut, which were key to achieving electoral victory. further west, indiana also proved to be a contested ground, with the difference of five thousand voters turning the state in favor of tilden and the democrats.   the swing states added up: by the end of the election night, tilden and the democratic party had amassed 184 electoral college votes, one shy of winning the whole thing. but those three aforementioned states under federal reconstruction - florida, south carolina, and louisiana - were in dispute. (so was colorado, which had just become a state). these 20 votes cast the whole election into confusion, leading to a massively political/cultural mess called the compromise of 1877 (which put hayes into the presidency and officially ended federal reconstruction).  oh - and finally, perhaps most importantly - issue 6: fraud. so much fraud. the percentage - 81.8% - is based on *reported* numbers of ballots cast. corruption raised hell during the 1876 presidential election in terms of counting votes. south carolina boasted 101% of eligible voters participated in the election. florida and louisiana similarly saw inflated numbers. democrats threatened both black and white republicans with violence in the south. not to be outdone, several northern states also saw inflated and almost impossible numbers of eligible voters coming to the polls. this massive amount of fraud led to the electoral confusion and disputed southern states, which in turn brought about the compromise of 1877.  so whether 81.8% of eligible american voters in 1876 actually participated... will never be known. but, without a doubt, the 1876 presidential election was both impressively strange and contentious.  *final note:* i do not do political history by trade. i research social and cultural history in the civil war era. i acknowledge there may be errors here. i look forward to reading other answers!  *sources below.*"

1bd5df351cceb62e	0	a	it was just an example of another an apolitical use of the term. there are others, i just don't remember any specifically. while i don't debate the inherent ties to right-wing politics, the lack of a dictionary definition, the popular usage of the term, as well as the inherent ridiculousness of the word itself make it hard to relate to an one political affiliation exclusively. but the main problem with the wording of the article's intro is that it doesn't specify the context of the political usage. it says feminazi refers to feminists who are preceived as intolerant of conservative views, which implies the word refers to any feminist who opposes any form of conservativism. i think it should be limited to conservative views on gender roles or something along those lines. the word would be used to refer to a feminist who was campaigning against fiscal conservativism or the war in iraq unless there was some clear tie between these views and his/her views on gender equality. 69.85.216.191

65791	0	a	"the big fuss is that when people say ""radiation"" they are conflating anything that emits/radiates energy (i.e. anything but the cold vacuum of space) with ""ionizing radiation""  - x-rays and gamma rays. the normal stuff like light, infrared, uv, radio is so common and harmless, we don't think of it as radiation, except when speaking scientifically.   the reason ionizing radiation is dangerous is that high concentrations of ionizing radiation are so powerful they penetrate all but the most dense matter (ex. lead). ionizing radiation has so much energy, when it's traveling through matter, it smashes through it, breaking apart molecular bonds. when these molecular bonds are in your dna, your dna can get messed up and that cell in you body won't function properly any more. a few cells here and there, your body can handle, the cells self-destruct or are otherwise cleaned up. but if too many get messed up dna, they get out of control, these cells run amok. we call that cancer.  [also, here's a handy chart from xkcd explaining the scale and levels of dangerous ionizing radiation.](https://xkcd.com/radiation/)"

72520	0	a	"as outlined in geoffrey robertson's book *an inconvenient genocide*, the core belief behind the turkish denial of the armenian genocide lies in the *motives* for the killings. turkish officials don't deny that ottoman military personnel killed armenians; they dispute the amount (they claim 300 000, while the most commonly referred to number is 1.5 million) and the reasoning behind it.  robertson cites the turkish ""official"" numbers of armenians living in turkey at the time as a reason that 1.5 million armenians couldn't have been killed: ""[turkish] demographic studies prove that prior to world war i, fewer than 1.5 million armenians lived in the entire ottoman empire. thus, allegations that more than 1.5 million armenians from eastern anatolia died must be false.""  (it's noteworthy that robertson counters this with evidence from the armenian church, who claim that 2.1 million armenians were living in anatolia at that time.)  on the intention, article ii of the united nations *convention on the prevention and punishment of the genocide* outlines that, in order for a sanctioned killing to be classified as a genocide, there must be ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group..."". turkish officials today claim that the killings were performed because armenians ""rose up"" against the ottoman government in support of russia, hoping that in victory they would claim their independence. to support this, in 2007 turkish counsellor orhan tung wrote in the new statesman (an opinion that the government mirrors to this day) that ""credible evidence"" for the intention to commit genocide has never been concretely found. this is obviously disputed, because as opposed to the holocaust or the bosnian war, there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.  (again, its worth noting that armenian historian ara sarafian reported to mediamax that *talaat pasha's report on the armenian genocide*, which was published by the gomidas institute in april 2011, as a proper ottoman government document showcasing this exact intent.)  tl;dr: the turkish government doesn't belief that an armenian *genocide* happened, but refer to it as politically motivated killings, because of the definition of ""genocide"" by the united nations.

66129	0	a	short answer: maybe, maybe not. no one is sure.   longer answer: the alphabet we use today is something that evolved over ~3,000 years, through 4 iterations minimum:   phoenician ⇒ greek ⇒ latin ⇒ modern languages with letters like j, w, and ß, as well as diacriticals like å and diphthongs like œ.   as a result, there’s no one answer for where the order for a given modern language comes from. the alphabet for english is different from that of french, or swedish, or polish. consider the hungarian alphabet, which looks like this:  a, á, b, c, cs, d, dz, dzs, e, é, f, g, gy, h, i, í, j, k, l, ly, m, n, ny, o, ó, ö, ő, p, q, r, s, sz, t, ty, u, ú, ü, û, v, w, x, y, z, zs  now, we can look at that and see that the basic order of the latin alphabet remains. the additions are just stuck in after the related letters whose sounds they modify. as with english, we have the latin alphabetical order, plus the later medieval insertions of j and w. the insertions are obvious and easy, because they simply follow the letters they were invented to modify/clarify.   but for the latin order, it’s trickier. latin is a blend of etruscan and greek, and they adopted neither wholesale. for example, etruscan had 3 letters for what we would think of a ‘k’ sounds today: c, q, and k (probably ‘kay’, ‘qoo’ and ‘ka’ but this is a guess since etruscan remains untranslated). g was a lesser-used sound in etruscan, but /k/ was very important, so they invented c from g, swapped kappa and gamma in the order, then inserted the ‘other’ k sound further down the line from Ϙ or qoppa , a pre-standardized greek letter used in some cities.   long story short, there’s some interesting linguistics research that suggests certain groupings of letters were created intentionally by different groups at different times, and then just kept out of habit by adopters.   so for example, the beth gimel dat sequencing mentioned in a number of other posts was adopted directly into greek as beta gamma delta, but then the gamma was replaced with c in latin.   edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

72472	0	a	the idea that you can assume the nonexistence of a purportedly-historical figure, as if that were some kind of default hypothesis, is methodologically suspect and unprovable. there’s no convincing explanation for *why* we should expect their to be more evidence than what we do have. the reality is that we have a limited and selective body of evidence for everything that happened in the ancient world. so we have to infer what we think is the most plausible narrative from the body of evidence that we do have. you just can’t expect absolute proof of every event in ancient history.   there are lots of reasons to suspect that jesus existed. we have multiple, independent, early attestation. things like the criterion of embarrassment suggest that the gospel writers had to work around historical memory in order to build the story they wanted to tell. christianity uniquely depends on the life and works of jesus in a way other religions don’t, so it’s hard to imagine how the movement started if jesus never existed, at least without making other assumptions for which we have less proof. there’s no convincing explanation, at all, for why and how christianity developed if not from a movement that claimed to be based on jesus’s followers.   of course the existence of christians around the time jesus is reported to have lived is evidence. how else could you explain their beliefs? there’s no parallel anywhere of people making up a mythical being and then claiming that he was actually a historical person who lived in or near their lifetimes.

(i don't know about her personal life, btw, just taking this from what i've seen of the show). the revolving doors of good and bad people exists to highlight how she is a good judge of character and morality.  i honestly think it's just significantly better than most reality tv shows because you watch to admire a genuinely admirable person.

52181	0	a	no, it has nothing to do with replacing drug dealers with licensed dispensaries.  the phenomenon of falling drug use among the youth in decriminalized or legalized areas has been studied since the 1970s, and appears throughout the relevant substance use literature.  there is a correlation between criminalization of drugs and higher substance use because of the lack of harm reduction strategies and false or misleading information about the subject.  when illicit drugs are decriminalized or legalized, drug use among youth drops in almost every region.  why this occurs is still debated, but it’s likely a combination of factors involving public health and safety and access to accurate and timely information about the drugs in question.  lying to kids doesn’t work, and preventing them from getting accurate information only makes it worse.

50695	0	a	"gosh, what a great question! it's such a great question, in fact, that **there is no definitive answer to it.** (maybe you can be the person who [trawls the nixon tapes](http://nixontapes.org/) and finds the answer.)  before i start the discussion, it might be worth pointing out something that you (well, maybe not *you* in particular /u/trynnafindabalance, but *you* collectively, as in everyone reading this) might have overlooked.  what's obvious to us today, with the benefit of hindsight, was not clear to nixon or anyone else in the united states in early 1972. we know the results, and so we have an artificial assurance that because things turned out they way they did, they *must* have turned out that way. living in the moment is to live in uncertainty.  at the start of 1972, opinion polls showed nixon and the various democratic contenders in a close contest. [sen. edmund muskie was considered a strong candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/31/archives/nixon-and-muskie-nearly-even-at-43-and-42-in-gallup-poll.html), and nixon feared facing alabama gov. george wallace (who was ultimately incapacitated in a may 1972 assassination attempt).   at the start of the year, when g. gordon liddy and attorney general john mitchell discussed the campaign to harass and sabotage the democratic party, nixon's wide victory wasn't yet apparent. that would come later.  it's also important to remember that the june break-in — for which gonzales, barker, mccord, martinez, and sturgis became infamous — was only part of the campaign approved by nixon's backers (including liddy). that campaign also included wiretapping and other kinds of snooping. **remember that nixon himself may not have been aware of the exact activities: it was the coverup that got him in trouble.**  but that doesn't get to your key question: ""what were the burglars after?""  there are *a ton* of fun theories about this. the most popular theory is that nixon believed that democratic national committee chairman lawrence o'brien had some dirt on a loan given by billionaire howard hughes (yes, of spruce goose and ""the aviator"" fame) to nixon in 1969. some of that money, [according to reporting by ""60 minutes,""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/) went to paying for frills at nixon's key biscayne home.  [e. howard hunt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ex-spy-crafted-watergate-other-schemes/2012/05/31/gjqah80ufv_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d90adae4247e), who hired the burglars, told the *miami herald* in 1997 that they were actually looking for ties between the democratic national committee and foreign governments. they were searching for evidence of foreign campaign contributions (something that might be familiar to americans lately), which would make great dirt in the election that year.  “what we were looking for is the same thing every congressional committee is looking for today, which was evidence of illegal foreign contributions,” he told *herald*. “that was the rationale for going in there. we’d heard rumors that both the vietnamese and fidel castro were inserting funds illegally into the democratic national committee. and the idea was to look at the books, photograph them, in and out, and that’s it. it didn’t seem like such a deal to me. you know, i’d been doing that stuff for years, a ‘black-bag job’ into other embassies. but you know, i didn’t have skilled people.”  in 2001, [liddy testified that the burglars weren't after anything political](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/us/g-gordon-liddy-gives-first-testimony-on-watergate-break-in.html): they were actually looking for photographs that put the wife of white house counsel john dean into a call-girl ring.   contemporaneous rumors held that the motive behind the burglary was to find evidence held by the democrats that linked nixon to various assassination attempts made by the united states against fidel castro. a lot of those rumors stemmed from the fact that the watergate burglars had deep ties to anti-castro plotters, and some americans reveled in the idea that the nation's dirty tricks had come home to roost.  [columnist george will has an interesting theory](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/08/reason-watergate-george-will/) that ties the motive to events happening in the days surrounding the burglary. one year before the break-in, the *new york times* began publishing the pentagon papers. will has suggested that nixon was worried that the papers would expose nixon's 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks related to the vietnam war. nixon's successful sabotage of those talks, revealed only in the past few years, violated the logan act of 1799.   regardless of the motive, it seems likely that nixon himself had no particular knowledge of the june break-in, but he did know broadly about a campaign of ""dirty tricks"" against the democratic party to hamper democrats' efforts to fight him in 1972. and as i said before, it wasn't the break-in that ultimately forced nixon to resign: it was the cover-up.   that's something worth remembering."

72748	0	a	"well, medieval travel writers knew that the chinese used toilet paper.  but i'm getting ahead of myself here.  > there was, in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a powerful king among the kings of china...he was wealthy as he was powerful, but he had grown old without being blessed with a son...at last, he sought the intercession of the prophet (whom allah bless and keep!) with the most high and implored him, by the glory of his prophets and saints and martyrs...that he would grant him a son.  > *[it works]*  > he committed his boy to...the harim till he reached the age of seven. then he ...gathered together the olema (*ulema*) and philosophers and doctors of law and religion, from all countries.   > *-from ""the craft and malice of women,"" burton trans.*  ""'alā' ad-dīn and the wonderful lamp"" is kind of an awkward text to work with. the manuscript tradition (...traditions) of the *1001 nights* is a mess already--our earliest notions of the text are only 1000 nights, for starters, and no surviving copy gets close to having 1001 tales. but probably the most famous of the tales even before disney has special problems, namely, it isn't actually part of that medieval manuscript tradition at all. the way medieval texts including/especially *1001 nights* worked, that absolutely doesn't mean it's not just as deeply rooted as others. but when a story first shows up in the 17th/18th century as europeans are getting their hands on the text, there's room for caution.  fortunately, tales like the frame story ""the craft and malice of women,"" which has an alternate title but why would you ever use it, serve as a fine substitute. the frame and some of its internal tales trace back through the egyptian manuscript tradition, so we're good here.  i dumped a block quote on you at the beginning so you could situate yourself: we've got a ""king of the kings"" of china (a title that medieval arabic geographers use when talking about a land they're a bit more familiar with, persia), an *ulema* or class of muslim scholars, astrologers, philosophers, religious leaders, and--oh yeah--islam. in other words, we're dealing with the trappings of medieval islamic culture in this text, too.  but, well...this doesn't exactly coincide with what merchant, diplomats, and ethnographers are writing about china just about the same time people start writing down *1001 nights* collections (or at least, ones that survive). for starters:  >  i do not know of a single member of [china or india] who is a muslim, and arabic is not spoken.  our ninth-century informant adopted by 10th century author abū zayd al-Ḥasan al-sīrāfī has more to say comparing the two lands:  > india is the land of medicine and of philosophers; the chinese also have medical knowledge. most of their medicine involves cauterization. in addition, they have a knowledge of astronomy and astrology, although this is more widespread in india.  just from the *beginning* of the tale, then, it's clear that *the craft and malice of women* is set in a fantastical china, not the actual one. the examples continue, like houses being made of stucco instead of wood. we'll return to the fantasy in a bit, because as promised: toilet paper.  abū zayd and whatever earlier accounts he's drawing on for the first book of his text (he probably doesn't know for sure and it may well have multiple sources; a later author attributes excerpts from it to a merchant called sulayman) offer a surprisingly rich view of early medieval china. in the beginning of book two, in fact, abū zayd recounts a long history of a recent rebellion! but it's especially fascinating to see what details of chinese culture the geographer-ethnographers and their sources emphasize.  > the chinese are unhygienic, and they do not wash their backsides with water after defecating but merely wipe themselves with paper.   yeah, like that one.  throughout the text, comparisons to arab culture or other known cultures help the original readers understand china and help us understand why abū zayd et al. emphasize particular details.  > their staple food is rice. they often cook a sauce to go with it, which they pour on the rice before eating it. their ruling classes, however, eat wheat bread and the ﬂesh of all sorts of animals, including pigs and other such creatures.   eating all meats is a big deal to the muslim observer. elsewhere, he compares chinese religious practices to zoroastrians. this is a good remind not to take everything at face value, though. anna akasoy has shown that ""zoroastrianism"" (a twisted idea thereof) was a common framework through which muslim ethnographers sought to understand foreign religions in, for example, west africa.  given the consternation we see on askhistorians about medieval muslims and alcohol, this is a particularly interesting observation:  > their drink is a wine made from rice. grape wine is not to be found in their land, and it is never imported—indeed, they do not know of it and do not drink it.   it looks like our author is quite familiar with wine made from grapes!  we also learn that the chinese tax foreign imports at a 30% rate, have a fiscal bureaucracy staffed by eunuchs, and place an enormous premium on reading and writing. i'll include another passage that's a popular interest topic on askhistorians: a sort of premodern passport:  > anyone wanting to travel from one part of china to another obtains two documents. the document from the ruler is a permit for the road, made out in the name of the traveler and those accompanying him, and stating his age and his companions’ ages, and the tribe from which he comes...the second document concerns the traveler’s money and any goods he may have.   > the reason for this procedure is that there are guardposts on the road where they examine both documents, and, when a traveler arrives at one, they write, ""so-and-so, son of so-and-so, of such-and-such an origin, arrived at our guardpost on the nth day of the nth month of the nth year, accompanied by so-and-so."" this is in order that none of the traveler’s money or goods should go missing.  i don't have to tell you not to take all this as surah truth about early medieval china. in most cases we're dealing with multiple layers of transmission, and a culture where repeating earlier stories was as good as firsthand observation/often treated as firsthand observation. nevertheless, modern scholars generally consider the fact-checkable points somewhat reliable--at least, much more so than contemporary accounts like *the wonders of india*, a fascinating collection of sailors' stories in which basically everyone gets shipwrecked on a island of amazons or cannibals.  i've already mentioned the difficult heritage of this text. it survives in one damanged manuscript copy today. but we know that whoever wrote it in the 9th century, it was read and copied in the 10th by abū zayd and by the persian scholar ibn al-faqīh. in other words, in the middle ages, this text got around a little!  but then we have to balance the scholars versus the storytellers. when we talk about ""medieval muslims' knowledge of china,"" we shouldn't just think about the best-connected. while obviously also not everyone was reading *1001 nights* itself, the ubiquity of many of its stories around the mediterranean world suggests a much more common currency for them than for abū zayd.  and don't let the insertion of islam, science, kings, and harems--perfectly ordinary elements of life to medieval muslims!--fool you. the china of the *1001 nights* is a china ""days of yore and in ages and times long gone before""--it's stocked full of the magic that, even if not the *specific* story of ala ad-din, the same air of exoticism and, dare i say it, orientalism."

(c)(t)   okay; just to note that it was very appropriate of you to revert the closing and leave the thread open, for the reasons you've stated.   there are a couple of things i'd like to clarify for future incidents. if amib had participated in that particular deletion discussion, then using his tools would likely be inappropriate. alternatively (as may be the case here), if amib had been involved in personal and direct conflict with ikip, especially if it was recent, then his use of tools would not be appropriate. such involvement can cloud judgement. however, mere general participation in other deletion debates/discussions is not necessarily enough for an admin to be considered """"involved"""". similarly,"

ffcc739193ff4894	0	a	hi mihir. we all understand the complications you're going through. as i said here, an unacceptable burden has been placed on the cas to make this poorly designed program work. we can be lenient when it comes to writing style, poor english, etc. these issues can be fixed gradually through copyediting, although i have to say that in some cases the english so poor (often resulting from copying text verbatim and then attempting to change individual words or verb tenses, or removing one or two phrases from the sequence) that the text is incomprehensible. only editors who are subject specialists can copyedit such articles, thus greatly reducing the pool of editors who can make the repairs. here's an example. the student had had multiple copyvio problems before and asked me to look at the new draft. i could confirm that blatant copyvio doesn't seem to be there anymore, but i simply cannot understand the content enough to fix the english or even comment on its accuracy.however we cannot be lenient on copyright violation, ever. the scale of the problem is now so large that it's now going to take literally months (and many editors) to find and remove it from articles edited by iep students. the silver lining to this cloud is that we'll probably find and get rid of a lot of other copy vio that didn't come from iep students. hardwired control is one example i found today. the whole article is basically copied from computer architecture and organization by john patrick hayes, and has been like this since at least 2008. best,

bb71e255e5fab9ce	0	a	that is fascinating and certainly enlightening, but it doesn't bolster the uncited statement in this article that the sigs broke their frames in testing.  though i wouldn't be surprised that something was going on under the table with the berettas, i was in the military when we did the switch from the old 45s to the 9mm, and the 9mm was a troublesome, finicky weapon not suited for most of the environments that we had to use them in.  the 45 might not have been pretty, but it would take a lot more abuse than the beretta would and keep firing.  but that's neither here nor there, my only contention is that there's an uncorroborated statement in this article that nearly the opposite is reflected in other articles.

74278	0	a	this is gonna get buried but i use to work for a very prominent manufacturer of e cigarette juices. helped build two of their manufacturing environments. i still remember when we heard about juul pods and reading through their patents.  i don't want to go in to too much detail but basically, average vape dudes will vape 3-6mg. juul pods are often 50 mg. if you tried to run 50mg in a traditional vape (yes its higher temp often which makes a difference) you'd cough up a lung. how does juul do it? nicotine salts.  read their patents and you'll see what they are doing and why juul is so addictive. it's not the fruity taste or the ease of delivery, it's the amount of nicotine you are able to ingest and with such ease and speed. cigarettes don't compare, i can't tell you how many occasional smokers i have seen go into full nicotine addiction after a few days with a few days with a juul.

(whether simeon is the cousin germane of jesus, as eusebius puts it, or the second or third brother of jesus – also ‘simon’ or ‘simeon’ – will be discussed later.)  p.416 ‘eusebius retains hegesippus’ internal references, even though at this point he does not enumerate what these sects were. he does in a later passage where his note about the election of simeon bar cleophas to succeed james for some reason triggers a discussion of hegesippus’ life.’  pp.468-9 (a) ‘suppose we were to say, as also concluded above, that by ‘rechabite’ eusebius was trying to same something similar to ‘essene’, ‘nazirite’, or ‘ebionite’; then out of this band of essene or ebionite ‘priests’, one, james’  ‘cousin’ and successor, simeon bar cleophas, emerged as the next ‘bishop of the jerusalem community’ in palestine (only, after the fall of the temple and jerusalem, there clearly was no ‘jerusalem community’ any longer to speak of).’  (b) ‘if we now superimpose the story of the stoning of stephen from acts upon the story of the stoning of james from epiphanious and eusebius, then simeon bar cleophas or the rechabite priestly ‘witness’ becomes james’ (and presumably simeon’s) ideological adversary paul . . paul takes the place of his opposite number, james’ successor in palestine, simeon bar cleophas – the only difference being that while one approves the other disapproves of what was done.’  p.607 'there is no mention on this page of simeon bar cleop"

19d6db697390c06d	0	a	i'm not sure that what they think they are doing is correct - it would be what they say they think they are doing, and reliable sources suggest that what they say they think they are doing is misleading.  the recent apa report says that what they say they think they are doing is not what is happening.  they say they think they can change people from having homosexual attraction in way that minimise this, or even have heterosexual attraction.  the apa has said quite categorically that there is no evidence to support claims like these.  i don't see that people's delusions, even if they are experts, need a place in the lead of an article in which they only feature marginally.  they feature marginally, because the therapy is seen as fringe by the mainstream psychological and psychiatric communities.  the only people who take it seriously usually do so from a religious perspective, and the apa has also stated that religious interests have no expertise on these matters, and should stick to religion.  it is a fringe theory, because very few practitioners in this area hold it as having any merit, and there is no evidence to support it.  it is to psychtherapy what 'the holy blood the holy grail' is to religious history.

15436b7716d074db	0	a	"""  mentioning darwin gave up natural selection and became a lamarckian  the article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of the origin of species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. hence i propose the following insert at the first darwin quotation in the current section ‘publication of the theory of natural selection’, which i also propose should be retitled ‘publication of the darwin’s theory of evolution’.  proposed insert:  'however,  even in the first edition of his book darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. in the last sentence of its introduction he said “furthermore, i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”  but by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. as c.d. darlington wrote in 1950 in his foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of the origin:  """"let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. on the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....the most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the professor of engineering at edinburgh. professor fleming[sic] jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as darwin believed, blended in inheritance. nature would never be able to keep any differences to select.   darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. he had hinted it in the first edition of the origin of species: at the end of the introduction he had said that """"natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" in later editions he hedged further. he fell  back on the other means. these depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. in adopting this view darwin was giving up his own, and wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of lamarck.""""  [p. xvii on the origin of species by means of natural selection first edition reprint in the thinker's library by watts & co, 1950.] '  but darlington failed to establish lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. in fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘mendelian-darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. but even by 1950 darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to darlington:  """"in view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. that is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. but where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. at the same time the foundation of darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in darwin's own country. the universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. they contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. the old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."""" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix]. '  i also propose the following edit of the article's introduction:  his 1859 book ‘’on the origin of species’’ posited natural selection was the main selector in the evolution and origin of species, but by its 1872 sixth edition darwin had abandon"

7070427ae19e9a0e	0	a	2014 (utc)  i object to this. it's not a calendar year that the competition runs in, but a football season. while it will be done before the end of 2014, it still takes place within the 2014/15 football season (as shown on the info box below), and when the next season edition (and so on) takes place with a january final, will create an odd situation where there is a 2014 ffa cup article, then 2015/16, and ongoing 20xx/xx article titles. it is better to standardise them now to a full seasonal date. there is also the possibility that a shift in competition dates over multiple seasons could see a competition run entirely in the first half of the year, followed by another edition of the tournament that starts and finishes in the second half of the year, which would lead to a very odd title situation if we go by a 'calendar year' article title process, eg we could end up with a hypothetical situation of having to disambiguate two editions of the tournament played in the same calendar year despite being in different football seasons.   09:14, 15 may

de978d244b7053a6	0	a	"""  first of all, congratulations on the good article status.  nice work.  since you don't object, i have added that section back to little boy.  that action should not affect its good article status.  here is my reasoning.  that particular bomb design is uniquely associated with the hiroshima bombing, which, in turn, was largely a public weapon effects demonstration.  its purpose was to show that a single bomb could duplicate the effects of, say, the tokyo firebombing which required 279 airplanes and 1,700 tons of bombs.  hiroshima was spared any earlier bombing in order to serve as a pristine nuclear bomb target, a situation made possible by its lack of importance as a military target.  the two airplanes that accompanied enola gay were there to measure the weapon effects.  nobody expected the loss of hiroshima to tip the balance in favor of immediate surrender.  the """"shock and awe"""" was expected to come from observing that it was effect of a single bomb.  most of what we know about nuclear weapon effects comes from an intensive study of hiroshima.  it was flat urban terrain well protected by natural and artificial firebreaks, and it was enough larger than the total destruction area that the margins of the effects could be precisely measured.  nothing new was learned from nagasaki, and no other bombs were tested on live urban targets.  in the many test explosions that followed, large and small, the overpressure and thermal impulse contours were measured, and the hiroshima effects were extrapolated to estimate the theoretical destruction area.  granted, it was pure happenstance that little boy, and not fat man, was used at hiroshima, but since it was this discussion of weapon effects seems appropriate here.

66044	0	a	the cool thing about the (large) calorie unit is that it is defined as the energy required to heat 1 litre of water by 1 degree celsius, which makes this calculation quite easy. if we only look at the energy required to heat the water, and assume ice-cold water is 0 degrees, it'll take 37 calories to heat 1 litre to body temperature. a quick google search reveals that 1lb of body fat contains about 3500 calories of energy, which requires you to drink a little under 100 litre of ice-cold water to burn.

20986351e07b8911	0	a	drprinceton  the way wiki immediately took down the 8 prime spirals pages and the minor referer pages about the person that discovered it way back in 1995 who also has a new project known as helixq is a joke.  let's see the argument of wiki is that the 8 prime spirals are not 'peer reviewed', in academia anything involving crypto and national security has been censored for decades and in 1995 when the original paper came out revealing numerous new prime theory that was years ahead of prime theory then, there was no way for such work to even be published, so usenet was how it was distributed, and it's a fact usenet has been heavily edited involving the topic.  now you can all point to your rules about 'peer review' but this shows how ignorant everyone thus far is about academia and censoring of math involving primes and crypto. let's see wiki has a page on dr. bernstein, a guy that took the nsa to court in 1995 the same year the paper was released, so that's how restricted publishing prime theory as it relates to crypto was in 1995, and is still today.  you expect nsa funded journals like ams to allow such information to be 'peer reviewed'?  anyway, my original article was 'heavy handed' killed by 'mods' at wiki and if you don't think the nsa has infiltrated wiki and almost every type of mass social media on the net (and yes to me wiki is a social media/project) then you need to read on the snowden documents.  so the article put a light on some very interesting 'prime theory' that is supported by github, anyone can check the github cite to see the info that every so-called prime algorithm and many have pages on wiki, all failed to outperform a 2300 year old algorithm, aka sieve of eratosthenes, all expect for one algorithm, a prime spiral algorithm that i know has been around since 1995 and a theory that has been heavily censored by the nsa since almost any reference to the many posts about ennisa prime formula has been erased from usenet, the original 'social media' of the net.  that all being said, i'm constantly now being 'threatened' by who? mods that think me insisting the removal of the original page is suspect to obvious manipulation most likely by the nsa?  prove wiki has no nsa bots or mods controlling the discussion, put the page up and let it be edited properly.   the original article was what i would think any real mod not working for the nsa would agree was pretty npov, and the 'cite' to github verified the whole claims, that a new prime algorithm is beating all known prime algorithms, something the other wiki page prime algorithms do not do.  the original article referenced the discover is connected to obvious 'disinfomation' as well, and the continued supression of anyone discussing his work and him as was done by wiki in this article is defacto proof that the ptb want to keep the public and academia in the dark about significant advancements in prime theory.  anyone can google nsa and the major journals you think are 'peer reviewed', what do you see searching nsa and ams, oh it's funded by the nsa. lol  that's your 'peer review', so any real mod here can step in and put the original article back. the pyprimes test of the algorithm shows how major this work is.  then the public can decide who discovered it, i know the origin is 1995 and 1997, i've been following it that long, and to see wiki put up pages about a slow 60mod algorithm from 2004 that was discussed in the same prime work in 1995 is a joke.  then you start to peel away who are the guys involved in all this new crypto and prime work and you start to see nothing but nsa funded projects.  what you don't think the nsa had laws in place for decades banning such work? they did. and now they control the academic journals with funding to furthr control what is released about anything that can impact crypto and the heart of crypto is what, prime number theory.  the mere fact that a project that is open to public scrutiny by competent computer programmers has shown for over two years a new prime algorithm is the so-called king of the hill of prime theory, and wiki mods and most likely nsa/wiki mods are doing their best to treat the pyprimes speed tests like they are insignificant.  the fact is pyprimes exposed how advanced the 1995 work of dr. adoni was by it beating all the major prime algorithms.  the fact is pyprimes referred to the 1995 30mod prime algorithm as 'croft spirals', which is a joke since croft created his site about the theory in 2010, then in 2012 pyprimes picked it up, and now wiki is saying so what, there's a new prime algorithm that dethroned every prime algorithm wiki has pages on.  i per

294653a6a2d944af	0	a	some small fixes i have tried to give the article some balance. bacque was actually an accomplished writer in canada before other losses, but it is important to point out other losses was his first foray into history. i think it's important to point out bacque is talking about losses among german pows held by the western allies. certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, german pows died in allied custody if the soviet union is included among the allies. as well, tens of thousands of german civilians died in soviet forced-labour crews. bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by anthony beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of europe before the marshall plan, the european reconstruction period, the founding of the ecsc and the beginning of the cold war. i am not familiar enough with bacque's books, especially the second one, to accurately describe them. i think someone who has read them carefully should, at least, give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand. i don't know why holocaust deniers would embrace bacque's work, since any neglect of germans held as pows by the western allies does not negate the genocide against the jews and other nazi victims. as for the plagiarisms committed by ambrose: they are not relevant to this discussion.

a5d9d2153c64521e	0	a	march 2008 (utc)  i think you are both right. an ethnic group is a group of people with a subjective belief in a common descent (or if you like the perception of a common descent). to be an ethnic group a group does not have to have an actual common descent, only the belief in a common descent. there's also the meaning of descent, in anthropology descent does not by necessity have have to have a biological reality, some ethnic groups claim a common descent from gods, or totems. so i think that the english certainly are an ethnic group/nation because they have a perceived common ancestry.   09:25, 16

aade001dbec6ef5d	0	a	i intended the comment about multiplicity to be an exception to the first line about quadratic convergence. you are correct that this is less than clear.  your suggested phrasing is fine.  durand-kerner is newton's method simultaneously on a vector of root guesses, with the derivative of the polynomial approximated by the derivative of what the polynomial would be if its roots were the current set of guesses.  this permits a lot of redundant computation to be eliminated,  and the algorithm parallelized.  if f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial and p,q,r,s are root approximations, the approximated polynomial is (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s) and its derivative at p is (p-q)(p-r)(p-s) so a durand-kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s)) and iterations of identical form for q, r, and s follow immediately.  you are correct this looks a lot like the example given in the jacoby's method article.

76912	0	a	it's a bittersweet reality really... one of my beloved felines used to hide toys and small rocks or the dogs kibble in my shoes... only my shoes.... so i got used to emptying my shoe before putting it on. after he died i would catch myself doing it and be so sad. now my son hides rocks... cat kibbles.... small toys .... in my shoes and i have to empty them.out and it makes me smile and think of my fluffball.  other things i do for current cats.... cover all plastic wrapped items like cases of water so the licker doesn't lick it until he's sick. or ensuring there is a kitty friendly staircase up to our bed and window sills etc for my little old lady cat.   the... this is my life now.... for my cat..... happens too often

b05474764367e403	0	a	solutions and suggestions ...    asked for a third-party opinion, so here goes:  this long-running discussion makes me think of a few things in general:  michael is a newby, so the wiki policy of don't bite the newbies seems to be relevant, and it looks like for the most part,  is sticking to that, apart from personal comments about michael's english. i can relate to the fact that it is sometimes hard to figure out what someone's point is, and that may be what kwami was trying to say about michael, but i think it's out of line to say that someone's english is non-native, or that someone's knowledge of arabic is similarly less than desirable. so my point on this one is this: stick to the point and leave personal comments out.  sometimes, discussions about articles and edits get pretty heated, even without personal comments. if you can't handle it, take a wikibreak. this is what i do, and it works for me.  divide up the topics for discussion - it makes it much easier for people to comment without having to read lots and lots of stuff they aren't interested in. for example, if i want to comment about /el/ and /ba'al/, where in that long discussion would i want to put my comment?  i think one of the best things that can be done for this article is to divide it up. put the meat of the wadi al-hol in an article by itself, and the proto-sinaitic script information in its own page. what remains of the middle bronze age alphabets is a general summary of why these two are thought to be related, plus thumbnail sketches of the content of those two articles, with appropriate main article type links. i think this will focus the discussion. for example, if colliss has written about one but not the other, all refutation and support of colliss's arguments will be guided to the right discussion pages.  this topic is one of many that has scholars screaming at each other. there are ways of summarizing the opposing arguments that allow casual readers to understand the controversy without getting information overload.  in relation to both of these scripts, the article suffers from a dearth of citations, appropriate or otherwise. the various assertions are interesting and serve as a stepping-off point for finding the actual sources, so i would oppose the deletion of every single unsupported citation. after all, it was only a few years ago that wikipedians started to insist on citations - before then, there was a whole lot of original research, some of which still persists without proper citations.  i for one would like to know how many examples of these inscriptions have been found. from the current state of this article, it seems like there is only one of proto-sinaitic (which was found in two locations, which can't be right) and that there are only two wadi al-hol inscriptions, which we can see in the illustration provided. there is also a citable reference in some national geographic website about semitic anti-snake inscriptions in part of unas's tomb in giza. maybe that should have its own page, too, with an appropriate link.  i don't buy this business about arabic being irrelevant. it reminds me too much of how european researchers dismissed all arabic scholarship about the arabic language itself. however, any references to arabic in an article on a topic from the middle bronze age have to keep in mind the huge time difference. for example, the hamza was a much later development, so it sheds about as much light on wadi al-hol as the development of the letters j, v and w.  i don't accept the table at all - the article is about an intermediate step that is not represented in the table. the table represents conjecture about connections between two known endpoints, hieroglyphic and the semitic alphabet (for lack of a better term). besides, if the hypothesis is that the proto-sinaitic script evolved from hieratic writing, then why is that script not represented in the table?  i don't accept the business of naming these letters. unless there is evidence to show that these symbols even had names at the time they were used, the names are anachronistic. if the names were in fact attested at a different time in a different script, the person promoting the use of the names has a big burden. in terms of wikipedia, all we have to do is say that a particular citable scholar has made the connection, and if the connection is disputed, we can point to a citation that says that too. it is our own editorial discretion that says how we portray that dispute, for example,  a says x, but others disagree, for example, b.  it is not clear whether x is true, as claimed by a, or whether y is true, as claimed by b.  scholars disagree on whether x is tr

e7d218d5fb8777ed	0	a	"""   hoover's murder investigation re kennedy   the information about hoover's role in the murder investigation of president kennedy is well documented.  hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of president john f. kennedy which is often called the """"crime of the century."""" the first citation in the kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the house select committee on assassinations. it issued its report in 1979 after a three year investigation into the assassination of john kennedy, martin luther king, and robert kennedy.   the report by the congressional committee was critical of the performance by the fbi as well as other agencies.   the second citation in the section on the kennedy murder is to the pbs frontline news show. it was reviewing the official government records that “electrified” top washington insiders and have been kept secret for over 40 years. these secret documents were obtained by the assassination records review board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure. the once secret documents are fascinating, especially as reviewed by pbs.    hoover conferred with nicholas katzenbach of the justice department about how to approach an investigation of kennedy’s murder. the former attorney general was grilled by the hsca 15 years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in kennedy's assassination. the copy of his memo is carried by lancer.  if the reader wants the full version of the testimony by katzenbach the reader should go to the house committee report.  president johnson, along with hoover, also knew about the oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be oswald trying to contact a """"hit man.""""   maybe there would be another motive for impersonating oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him. i don't know what it would be.   there is no question the fbi, under hoover, acted as the primary investigative arm of the warren commission, and hoover testified to the commission as seen from these once secret transcripts of the warren commission hearing:  i have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of president kennedy   the testimony is unsealed now.  there is no secret anymore about the fbi destruction of evidence. they were caught and its now public knowledge. there is a full pulic record. the agent involved even wrote a book about it.      the american public does not believe the conclusions reached by the warren commission and believes the government has something to hide.  this is what the assassination records review board believes.    conclusion  therefore, any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in. one should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesn't like it. if that were the criteria for deleting information, then wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country. nothing """"negative"""" can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a """"theory."""" no, the information is documented by reputable sources.  what i can't figure out is why mr. hoover's sexual life gets so much space, and yet someone doesn't want information on hoover's job performance on the biggest case of hoover's career.

66461	0	a	"good answer! to expand on this, in the industry we call it ""60 cycle hum"":  electrical current flow creates a magnetic field, and transformers have cores made of ferrous metal.  so the changing alternating-current is causing the big metal cores to move a little bit in a way that matches the rate at which the current changes.  the fundamental frequency is 60hz like our power frequency, but because of a phenomenon called [""magnetostriction""](http://tdvib.com/magnetostriction/) the transformer iron vibrates at twice that rate, or 120hz.  if an electrical load on a piece of equipment screws up that normal 60hz current we can absolutely hear it:  transformers that have a ton of current harmonics no longer produce a nice ""60 cycle hum"", but can have a much louder, sharper buzz that sounds very noticeably different."

65709	0	a	this event apparently released 3 solar masses worth of energy.    if that sentence sounds weird, remember e=mc^(2), which means energy and mass are interchangeable.  so to figure out how much energy that is, you have to take 3 times a solar mass (2&times;10^30 kg) and multiply it by the speed of light (300,000,000 m/s) squared, which is an awfully big number:  * 5.4&times;10^47 joules * 1.3&times;10^41 kg or 66 billion solar masses of tnt equivalent (**a typical galaxy made out of tnt**) * 2.2&times;10^34 kg or 11,000 solar masses of thermonuclear explosive * 5000 type 1a supernovae * 100 hypernovae  a sphere of lithium deuteride thermonuclear explosive that massive would be 36 million km across, and isn’t even capable of exploding because it is so heavy it would immediately collapse into an 11,000 solar mass black hole.  but this was a release of gravitational energy, not light, so we never saw a thing, just felt the slightest ripple when it distorted spacetime as it passed by.

72330	0	a	"so, i was curious because this was high on my front page and there were no answers, so i did a quick search. i found a paper discussing the effects that the 1918 flu pandemic had on iran, and it included some background about the effect of wwi on the iranian populace as well. a lot of this post is taken directly from this article, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased. (the citation is : amir afkhami. ""compromised constitutions: the iranian experience with the 1918 influenza pandemic."" bulletin of the history of medicine 77, no. 2 (2003): 367-392. https://muse.jhu.edu/)  so iran declared its neutrality during wwi, but despite this the great powers used iran as a battlefield at times. russia and britain both had imperialist designs on iran for various reasons, interfering with its internal politics to try and secure their own interests, and as a result it became a target during the war. some of the incidents during the war include: the ottomans chasing the russians into northwestern azerbaijan in 1914; in 1915 wilhelm wassmuss organized a revolt among the qashghai tribesman in southern iran against the british who controlled oilfields in the area; the russians counterattacked the ottomans allowing the british to recover control of southern iran by 1916; a revolutionary iranian group called the jangalis emerged to control the countryside of gilan in 1917-1918; britain also tried to use iran as a springboard to attack russia in an attempt to reverse the russian revolution of 1917, and the new soviet union responded by annexing parts of northern iran.  as a result of the warfare occurring in iran, there was damage to iran's economic, industrial and agricultural power. the occupying armies forcefully requisitioned or looted supplies. this led to widespread famine and the spread of disease. iran's government was also essentially a protectorate surviving at the whims of whichever power was present and winning at the time, leaving them with little ability to actually help their own people. in addition, ahmad shah qajar, the ruler of iran at the time, was a weak ruler with little influence in his own government. the populace resented his father for authoritarian policies, and in an attempt to address this, ahmad shah tried to appoint only the best ministers, but he was unable to control their actions. in the face of the great powers of wwi using their country as a battlefield, and the threat of the soviet invasion and their humiliating demands, the populace resented the government's weakness, contributing to the political instability.  while political instability and warfare can lead to famines, the biggest cause is often climatic. 1916 and 1917 were both years with very dry summers, leading to crop failures. this, coupled with the foreign armies seizing what food they could, resulted in widespread famine, which was worsened by hoarders and speculators. when the influenza pandemic broke out in the spring of 1918, grain supplies had hit a low point, prices had doubled from six months before, (which had reached a ten-year peak). in addition, there were outbreaks of bubonic plague, cholera, malaria and typhus. the british were also building up for their attack on the soviet union, and sponsoring a native military contingent known as the ""south persia rifles"", making long-term contracts with large landowners for grain to feed the troops, adding to the scarcity.  f.a.c. forbes-leith describes the situation in what i assume is a memoir, checkmate: fighting tradition in central persia. (i haven't read the actual book and am using a citation from afkhami's article).  >""the country was in a terrible state and the peasantry was in the last stages of starvation. every time i was forced to stop my car, i was surrounded by hundreds of near-skeletons who screamed and fought for such scraps as i was able to spare. in a single day's journey of fifty-six miles between the towns of kirind and kermanshah, i counted twenty-seven corpses by the roadside, most of them those of women and children, and the general condition of life amongst the peasants was so frightful that i was ashamed to eat my simple rations in their presence.""  so the iranian famine of 1917-1918 was primarily a man-made catastrophe exacerbated by climatic conditions in which there was also an influx of infectious diseases. the wikipedia listing states that majd's initial population estimate of 19 million is called into question with other estimates only being 11 million. afkhami's article says that iran's projected population at the beginning of 1918 was 11 million, so it may be that the 19 million number comes from *before* wwi broke out, and after the famine it had hit 11 million, at which point the influenza pandemic hit, killing a further 8% to 21% of the population according to afkhami. (0.8 to 2.3 million). although afkhami's footnotes say that the population in 1918 was not too different from the population in 1913, before the war, which i am not sure whether to believe or not, given the effects of famine prior to the flu's arrival."

50703	0	a	"there was no specific planning for or against the patination of the copper. no measures were taken to either encourage or discourage the natural process. the copper skin of the statue is actually a fairly thin layer, about the thickness of two pennies, and it was left more or less untouched for the first hundred years or so of the statue's existence. any effort to remove the patina would have disturbed the protective oxidation layer and eventually led the the thin copper sheets weathering away. the original copper did deteriorate over the years from water making its way into the statue and collecting in low points. this damage meant that several parts were so severely damaged that they needed to be replaced by the 1980s. the tip of her nose, the end of a hair curl, and the entire torch were replaced in a massive repair effort from 1984-1986.  prior to that, there were various attempts over the years to seal the copper of the statue from the inside. these various efforts created a buildup of a variety of coatings, including bituminous sealants and many layers of paint. these remained intact until they were all removed during the 1980s restoration using a mixture of solvents and liquid nitrogen. as a result, the inside of the statue is now just the bare copper with the exception of the inside of her head, where the crown observation platform is. that area is painted because of ongoing vandalism concerns. it is repainted once a year on christmas eve to allow time for the paint to dry over christmas day, because that is the one day each year that the statue is closed.  the statue's skin does have many holes. some are from missing rivets, some from water damage, and some others are intentional, to allow water to drain out and prevent it from collecting in low points. the holes are mostly small, but on bright days you can certainly see pinpricks of light coming into the statue, particularly as she narrows toward her shoulders and head.  all of this is not to say that people did not take notice of the greening of the statue and occasionally advocate for it to be ""restored,"" presumably by polishing or otherwise removing the patina. when asked about the patination, bartholdi (the original sculptor) suggested that it could be gilded to prevent further discoloration. no effort to that effect was ever seriously considered as far as i know. the treatment of the statue during the 1980s restoration was a subject of major interest to people who care about historic structures. there were a number of papers written about the restoration techniques employed in the repair work and the project was a major subject of the annual meeting of the national association of corrosion engineers. several papers were written and presented at that conference and later combined into a book on the subject."

'island' systems with much smaller load/generation have a much harder time maintaining a conistent 60hz.

(this means that the ~~experienced travel time~~ **time that passes inside the ship** approaches 0 as f approaches 1. if you could travel arbitrarily close to light speed, you would experience the journey as effectively instantaneous.)  here's a calculator for it: http://www.emc2-explained.info/dilation-calc/  at .999c (99.9% light speed) it calculates that time is slowed down to 4.47% of the outside value. that means four years are experienced as approximately 65 days.  edit: fixed the wording. this is literally the time that passes for the ship. it affects everything, from atomic clocks to metabolisms to brain activity.

71696	0	a	no, i don't think any telescope could come close.  for instance, hubble has an angular resolution of about 1/10 of an arcsecond. it is approximately 384,000km from the moon. 1/10 arcsecond is 1/36000 of a degree, and a circle is 360 degrees.   1/10 arcsecond on a circle with radius 384000 km is:  2 * 384000 * pi / 360 / 36000 = 0.18617  so the resolution of hubble would be 186m, much too large to make out a single human. to achieve the sub-1m resolution needed to discern a person on the moon, a telescope would need a resolution over 100 times better, which does not exist.

51564	0	a	kind of points to a brain anomaly in the region where pain is processed. emotional pain is processed in the same region as physical.  edit 2: while the emotional and physical pain holds, some people think the brain plays no role in the healing process. it’s true there are signaling cells at the site of the injury that kick off a cascade of healing although it’s still a highly researched topic because there’s a ton more to learn. if the issue is with the local signaling cells then i’d guess she has a genetic defect that renders signaling cells and pain receptors useless. but that doesn’t take away from the fact that pain receptors and emotional pain are hitting the same brain region.   edit: also, if the brain is unaware of pain (injury) the normal repair response may not happen, meaning instead of sending out the troops to build scar tissue as quickly as possible it goes about just growing and sloughing cells like normal, which over time would fill in any injuries with normal tissue albeit slowly. that would be life threatening though if she had a major injury.

d263ce44390c3853	0	a	"""  i see your point, but i think the difference is that we aren't talking about translations and romanizations. that is what we are using already (romanizations). for example vegeta instead of bejita or vejita. noone's using unnofficial romanizations, or straight romaji or kanji, which is why i get riled up when i see the """"use english"""" argument. so i hope i didnt come off as contentious. it's just that i think people misuse the word translation. i dunno if you saw the old mr. satan/hercule argument. points on commonality were certainly worth discussing, but a number of the more vocal people were insisting that mr. satan was a japanese phrase and hercule it's translation. that isn't what translation is. the thing is, and i think a lot of people forget, is that english-language wiki is a language choice, not a subset of countries that we are allowed to write articles about. english wiki is worldwide, like every other wiki. most other wikis get this too. look at the french wiki. the french dub named piccolo as satan (kami being god of earth, they figured his evil counterpart would be the devil) and then changed mr. satan to hercule (that's where the name comes from). but the articles their were on piccolo and mr. satan, making note that when adapted into french the names satan and hercule were used. on attacks- those are likely going to be restructered soon anyway. as for why in most cases we used names from the daizenshuu attack list, it is because that is the only comprehensive list that exists. i have tried... really hard... to work such a list based on the dub and even viz manga. you can't. the manga doesn't cover every aspect of the series and misses some attacks, and viz is weird with attacks (keeps some the same, half-translates some, translates some into chinese). the dub has some that are the same or translations, some with names invented for the dub, some attacks misnamed as other existing attacks, some attacks with multiple names, and some attacks without names at all. for example, piccolo's old signature move that you see in games more often now was the bakurikimaha. you saw it when he attacked raditz on the cliff. gohan's first signature was the masenko. according to the dub these two distinct techniques are the same move and called masenko-ha. goku's last ditch move is the genki dama and yamcha's signature ki attack is the sokidan. according to the dub they were both spirit bomb, and the sokidan has also been renamed spirit ball. tenshinhan's signature kikoho has been called between dub, manga, and games the tri beam, blast cannon, ki blast cannon, and chi kung blast. it just gets confusing trying to keep track. and then there are moves that don't get named, like freeza's death ball pr the big bang attack. they get named as such now because of video games, which are translated from japanese, which goes by the daizenshuu list, so any attack that doesn't have a dub rename tends to be some form or translation of the original name (since no dub equivolent exists for them).   i really hoped that makes sense... its like 3 in the morning here, so if it didn't let me know and i'll clarify.

71356	0	a	i'll start with some of his accomplishments: he was one of the first people to propose primordial black holes along with carr, zel'dovich and novikov, which if observed could give us a window into the early universe, and may even be dark matter. perhaps his most well-known work is the proposition that black holes radiate as black bodies (ie hawking radiation), generalizing the work of unruh. this has led to the creation of the lively subfield of black hole thermodynamics and information theory. he is also one of the founders of quantum cosmology (the idea that you can have a wave function representation of expanding spacetime) along with hartle, wheeler and dewitt.  as for how he compares against the greats... this is not to belittle his accomplishments in any way, of which there were obviously many, but none of his predictions have ever been experimentally verified. a lot of people here are comparing hawking to the likes of einstein, but honestly, from a working physicist who is familiar with his work, he doesn't even come close. einstein's ideas represented a fundamental shift in our understanding of the universe, and have been verified over and over again. there are many others who have fundamentally altered our view of the universe (and have been vindicated by experiment) that many laymen have probably never heard of before (maxwell, dirac, de broglie, bohr, heisenberg, friedman/robertson/walker, weinberg/salam, yang/mills, noether, gell-mann, and these are just some prominent theorists of the last century, there are many more great minds behind every groundbreaking experiment, like wu, hubble, ruben, weiss, rutherford, thompson, etc). until his ideas are verified, they're just untested hypotheses (though nobody in the field seriously doubts hawking radiation isn't real). hawking's contributions, while very interesting in their own right, are not the ground-breaking game-changers that revolutionized physics.  that said, i'd say he's probably one of the most influential scientists of the century, not only because of his interesting work, but also because the man is an example of perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds. not only did he manage to survive, but he pushed the boundaries of human knowledge. that's something we can all aspire to.

c14191d3b69c839b	1	a	"""   wikipedia is communism!!!!   it had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. from the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.  having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. with the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: the three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. then, justine and beth had been roommates while i lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.  as i sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, i allowed my eyes to truly linger on justine as she told beth about a recent situation at work. the florida sun had certainly added a glow to justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. as when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as i had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which beth and i both certainly appreciated. the long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. the red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.  the conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. i took the opportunity to once again study beth, and was equally impressed. while noticeably shorter than justine, beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. as in college, beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to justine.  it felt so good to be in their presence once again. especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, i was thankful that i had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. i had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, i was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.  the intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. i was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. an arm wrapped around each of them, i held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants i typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. my eyes closed, i reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.  no words were needed. and as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, i smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching beth and justine in their own intimate encounters. but eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. i stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.  i awoke in the morning to the scent of french roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while beth and i held each other as she slept. the feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h"

50812	0	a	"well, the answer is unfortunately not that satisfying, but i expect that you came into this question realizing it was a somewhat vain hope given the use of ""disappeared from history"". to provide a little background, sally hemmings had a number of children, some of whom died in infancy, which are generally accepted as being fathered by thomas jefferson (i would direct to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/6aqa2e/panel_ama_slaves_and_slavers/dhj0rqm/?context=2) for more discussion, broadly, of the sexual relationships between masters and slaves in the antebellum south). whether or not this was fact has been debated since before jefferson himself died, and scholarly opinion has swayed about, but it is pretty much now the consensus.  anyways though. harriet, described as ""nearly as white as anybody and very beautiful"" had no trouble passing for white, and as you already are aware, made use of this. she was freed in 1822 at the age of 21, apparently on a promise jefferson had made to sally hemings to do so when the children reached that age. the documentation of harriet's liberation is almost next to nothing. edmund bacon, who worked as an overseer at monticello, described her departure, being the one who gave her the $50 that you mention, and stating she had been headed for philadelphia. and as for her life after she headed north, we only have one account which we can give any real credence to, that from her brother madison, who wrote in 1873:  >harriet married a white man in good standing in washington city, whose name i could give, but will not, for prudential reason. she raised a family of children, and so far as i know they were never suspected of being tainted with african blood in the community where she lived or lives. i have not heard from her for ten years, and do not know whether she is dead or alive. she thought it to her interest, on going to washington, to assume the role of a white woman, and but her dress and conduct as such i am not aware that her identity as harriet hemings of monticello has ever been discovered.   washington city in this case refers to the district of columbia as it was then known, and it would appear that while she kept a low profile, she did not choose to cut all ties with her family, at least immediately, as madison claims to have remained in contact with her through the 1860s (he was writing in 1873). he also gives us reason to believe it quite possible that she has living descendants, but of course was much to guarded to allow any information to get out which could give much of a thread to follow. what the end of communications even meant is up in the air - perhaps she decided to cut her final tie to non-white society, or perhaps she simply died. we can only speculate. but in any case, madison's account is the lone source we can rely on to reconstruct any sense of her post-emancipation life.  she was not the only child of jefferson and hemmings to follow such a route. while madison and eston both left records, writings, and known descendants, their brother beverley was similarly allowed to leave monticello for the north, and even less seems sure about his fate then his sister, doing a similar disappearing act but without, it seems, even the record of correspondence that harriet left he was briefly in contact, long enough to communicate back that he had married a white woman and that they had a daughter, living in washington city, but that seems to be the end of it. in both the case of beverley and harriet, it should be noted, jefferson *officially* recorded them as being escaped slaves, as their departure was recorded in the 'farm book', but it was quite clearly allowed with his approval as a means of sending them north in technical compliance with the aforementioned agreement he had made with sally. the backhanded means of liberation is thought to have been a means of following through without providing ammunition for those looking to prove the parentage.  now, as to the second part of your question, you might perhaps want to x-post to /r/askscience as it is less a history question that one for a geneticist. what i do understand of these things would imply that it is possible to find genetic matches that show relations by various degrees, but it isn't like those genes are signed ""t.j."" establishing who that common ancestor is takes a lot more leg work. to compare to the famous claim about genghis khan's widespread dna, this is based on finding the the same y-chromosome (which records patrilineal descent) in millions of people that shows they share a common male ancestor a certain period back in time. genghis khan is then assumed to be the one based on historical circumstances. but i would hesitate to say more, as again, this is getting into the territory for a scientist to discuss.  cogliano, francis d., ed. *companion to thomas jefferson*. wiley. 2011  gordon-reed, annette. *the hemingses of monticello: an american family* w. w. norton & company, 2008  ishida, yoriko. *modern and postmodern narratives of race, gender, and identity: the descendants of thomas jefferson and sally hemings*. peter lang, 2010 "

71464	0	a	the time dilation factor (lorentz factor) can be calculated by the equation: 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 ).  note that v/c is your speed relative to the speed of light (.999 in this case).  for a speed of .999c, we get a lorentz factor of 22.37    this means that for every 22.37 years in the reference frame of earth, one year occurs in the reference frame of the spaceship.    this is not a mere illusion or change in how time is experienced, but an actual dilation of space-time.  relative velocity causes dilation in spacetime, leading to many counter intuitive phenomena.  one of my favourites is that events that are simultaneous in one reference frame are not necessarily simultaneous in another.

897d2118b5d999b4	0	a	"""  old discussions from 2003   some mormons argue that even assuming mainstream christianity's definition of god's omnipotence and omniscience, not only can god exalt mortal man, but god must do so.   i don't understand this sentence.  i don't know what the issue is supposed to be, to which mormons are contributing their """"argument""""; i don't know what it means that god """"must"""" exalt mortal man.   20:54, 4 nov 2003 (utc)  agreed. it is not clear what the writer meant. i have no idea who wrote it, but i'll change it.  sorry for that very brief and very confusing statement. where it reads, omniscience, it should have read, omnibenevolence. the idea is that the mormon meaning of deification is supported even by mainstream christianity's definition of god's omnipotence and omnibenevolence (in contrast to mormonism's less literal definition of god's omnipotence). namely, if god really is omnipotent, then god can deify mortal man...and if god really is also omnibenevolent, then not only can god deify man, but god's goodness compels god to deify man.  23:36, nov 4, 2003 (utc)   much more clear.  thanks.  23:40, 4 nov 2003 (utc)   this does raise a question for me; and since i argued with my wife today, and lost, concerning who should have the car this morning, i am in the mood to ask it.  should """"omnipotence"""" and """"omnibenevolence"""" imply, as your argument holds, that making gods out of created beings is something that god must do, then why do you not expect that every person would be exalted?  for that matter, is god too small to exalt animals? vegetables? rocks or sand?   perhaps the argument assumes the same shallow and useless understanding of """"omnipotence"""" and """"omnibenevolence"""" as atheists do?  argumentatively yourse,  21:52, 15 dec 2003 (utc)   i am curious.  being orthodox, we believe that god's benevolence includes allowing mankind to have free will to choose holy ways or not, to work toward theosis or not.  if it is mandantory that god exalt mortal man, what does that say for what mormons believe about free will and why it does (or doesn't) exist?    i changed the nature of god is to become the nature of man to the nature of god is to become united with the nature of man.  this is an important distinction. this union of the two natures first took place in the incarnation of jesus christ, when the two natures were joined in christ's one person. god's divine nature is unfathomable, and will never be understood by us, much less become completely ours. theosis is rather our participation in god's divine energies (as described/defined by gregory palamas) and union with his nature. we will still never be divine in quite the same way that god is divine; we will still always possess a human nature only, it's just that that human nature will be thoroughly healed and cleansed, and united with the divine nature. at least that's my current understanding. references available, and corrections remain most welcome. -)   06:23, 10 dec 2003 (utc)  excellent  18:17, 10 dec 2003 (utc)   entire sanctification   i'm pretty sure that it is tolerable to teach """"entire sanctification"""" in the eoc; although i'm sure that it isn't a doctrine in the sense of being something necessarily believed.  therefore, i would like to  remove the disclaimer sentence in the opening paragraph, which says """"but this is not a doctrine of orthodoxy"""".   16:09, 24 dec 2003 (utc)   the """"eoc"""" abbreviation threw me for a minute; my first assumption was """"evangelical orthodox church"""", which my local parish used to be part of until not that long ago; then i realized you probably meant """"eastern orthodox church"""", right? gotta love these tla's, especially with regard to denominations. anyway, """"entire sanctification"""" is probably one of those teachings that isn't officially affirmed or denied by eastern orthodoxy, in large part because the doctrine of entire sanctification was formed in a different context and in response to different questions and answers than anything eastern orthodoxy has really needed to directly confront. in a similar vein, i haven't been able to get a straight answer from anyone as to what orthodoxy thinks of semi-pelagianism; closest i've come is """"orthodoxy deals with different questions"""" or """"orthdoxy would pose the question differently, and then answer that other question like this"""". coming back to entire sanctification, the closest thing to an """"official"""" position i can think of is just a story of a monk telling his abbot that he had finally """"arrived"""" and was no longer experiencing"

(also i'm just now realizing that mom must have been about 5 weeks pregnant with my little brother, due to timing.  holy shit.)  i spent most of that time coloring in the waiting room, and had for the most part gotten over my lack of birthday.  but then, very very late we got back from the hospital one night and my dad opened the front door to the house and presents just spilled out.  so, so many!  i was only 6 but the pile was bigger than me, and it was mindblowing.  dad said the birthday gnomes must have done it.

""we meet again"" is all he said, and that was probably only the second or third time i've ever seen my dad cry. i bawled quietly as he wrote it all in the book. i never knew my grandfather, but i knew my grandmother very well. she'd always been content with my dad and us, never seemed to have any regrets. she read *tonnes* of romance novels. sometimes she would say in a jovial tone that she's ready to move on and i would balk, but she'd just say ""you'll understand when you're older.""  i never knew the love they shared but it must have been something powerful. they were from a generation of brits that didn't share their feelings as openly as later generations, so i know those few words scrawled in that book mean way more than their brevity might imply."

73255	0	a	strange that this study considers the role passion plays and not sexual satisfaction.   the male orgasm is widely understood to be the signal that a sexual encounter has ended - so it is more likely to happen every time. a woman’s orgasm isn’t as essential to the sex act. orgasm isn’t essential to enjoyable sex, but i’d figure most people would rather have one than not.   as a woman who had a few semi-serious relationships (that lasted long enough to be considered long-term by this study) i know i rarely initiated because i wasn’t ever expecting to be fully satisfied by sex with my partner (sad but true).  once that changed, my behavior changed.  edit: addition: a few people are asking if i took initiative to improve the situation. yes, i did. and before i found the right partner, those attempts were not fruitful.

72658	0	a	"i am a little late to the party this time, but i want to give some insight about the situation regarding this issue in late 6th century/early 7th century arabia. removing pubic hair (and armpit hair) was considered very routine in arabia at that time. both for men and women.  al-bukhari narrated in his book [\(hadith no.: 5889\)](http://www.gowister.com/hadith/bukhari/5771/) and muslim narrated in his book [\(hadith no.: 257\)](https://sunnah.com/muslim/2/64) that prophet muhammad (570 - 632 ce) (pbuh) said: ""the natural instincts are five: circumcision, shaving pubic hair, cutting the mustache, cutting nails and plucking armpit hair."" so, it was not only thought to be something that is recommended religiously but it was looked upon as part of basic instinctual human hygiene.  also, [al-bukhari \(5247\)](http://www.gowister.com/hadith/bukhari/5134/) and [muslim \(715\)](https://sunnah.com/muslim/17/73) narrated that jaber ibn abdullah (died 697 ce) said: ""we were once with the prophet in a battle, and when we returned back to medina, we went to enter (the city). the prophet said: let us wait and enter (the city) after nightfall, so that women with unkempt hair can have time to fix their hair, and those whose husbands were away can have time to shave their pubic hair."" we can deduce from that that it was routine for women to shave their pubic hair in preparation to meet their husbands.  [al-bukhari \(3989\)](http://www.gowister.com/hadith/bukhari/3908/) also narrates a long story about a man called khubaib ibn adiy (died early 7th century) that has a part where he was captured by some non-muslim enemies, and they were about to kill him so he asked them to lend him a shaving razor, so that he can shave his pubic hair before they kill him, and they did lend him the razor. this can show that not only was it routine for men to shave their pubic hair, but it was also considered more dignified to die clean shaven.  on another note, most people used to pluck their armpit hair instead of shaving, although there has been reports that some people would find it very painful and would shave instead, but i'll keep the sources for other time not to derail the main discussion.

51854	0	a	this is not really news. at least, the public health guys at my med school have known this for a while. the real mystery is why the healthcare costs are so disparate between the united states and other nations. and the answer, which may surprise you, is more than likely not due to greed.  that is to say, public hospitals like state and federal hospitals, and other not-for-profits do not have high prices listed on their chargemaster because somebody somewhere is pocketing this cash en-masse. the highest paid people at these non-profit hospitals (which compose 80% of us hospitals) are specialist surgeons and diagnosticians, and their salary composes only about 10% of healthcare expenditure in the united states. think about this, if you halve the salaries of all us physicians, your $40,000 bill will only go down by about $2000 to $38000. the vast majority of expenditure in the modern us healthcare system is due to the monstrosity of the hospital. insurance companies aren’t pocketing this, because remember, we have not included them in this consideration. there are no shareholders pocketing it, and even though physicians are well compensated in the united states (equivalent to canada and some european countries), most of your money isn’t going there.  so why the hell is it so much more expensive in the united states? public health guys are having a hard time figuring out, but right now the large culprit is a massive conglomeration of inefficiencies. a large amount of funds are funneled to administration, in terms of handling the bureaucracies, paperwork, and negotiations of interacting with insurance companies—so when i said insurance companies are not responsible earlier, that was only mostly true. additionally, because of the highly litigious nature of healthcare in the united states, there is much more infrastructure involved in defending against lawsuits. lots of what many people might consider unnecessary testing and imaging are performed because even though there is a high likelihood that what they’re testing for isn’t what’s going on, there’s still a 1% chance, for example, that they miss a critical, life-threatening diagnosis.   there’s also a cultural element: that is, in the united states, even when somebody is on the end of their ropes, for some reason people in this country have the mentality that “everything must be done to save my family member.” even if those efforts prolong the suffering of the patient and cost of care enormously. how much do you think one icu days cost? now, how many days do you think it takes the average us citizen to decide “enough is enough, grandpa isn’t getting better” compared to european countries? as a comparison, in the uk, if you’re over 70, dialysis is straight-up refused if you’re in renal failure. this is almost certainly a death sentence. whereas in the united states, we have an entire branch of medicare that covers the cost so long as you paid your fica.  there are quite a few additional measures, like improving the overall public health in the united states (obesity, heart disease, etc), limiting exposure to trauma-causing devices (ahem), which would likely improve healthcare costs. it is much more efficient in terms of length of life gained and cost of care to prevent a disease, than to try to cure it.   axing insurance, setting wait-lists for elective procedures, improving public health measures, and after all this taking a heavy dissecting knife to the administrational inefficiencies because of all the aforementioned reasons are the best ways of cutting out the fat of our healthcare costs.

71548	0	a	> robertson-head and allen-head fasteners can handle more torque than phillips-head fasteners, but are more expensive. because the bottom of the hole is flat (unlike the pointed end of the phillips), there's more contact area and so it's less likely to cam-out.  while i thank you for bringing up canada's contribution to the fastener world, a couple of things... robertsons aren't square-drive.  while they're square in cross-section, the driver and the hole in the screw are slightly tapered, and the bottom rounded. this makes it much harder to strip a robertson.   it also means that the screw can stick to the driver even when both are non-magnetic, which is really handy.

71452	0	a	in the u.s. midwest you have the cold arctic to the north of you and the warm tropics to the south of you. in the higher latitudes (north), you have a winter where it is pretty much always cold. arctic winters don't have warm winter days like in the midwest. in the tropics it is pretty much always summer. it is hot year-round.  during a midwest winter sometimes the air will blow down from the north and be very cold, but sometimes it will blow from the south and be warmer. there might be a 100f difference or more between northern canada and the equator. cold northern winter air and warm tropical air meet in the middle and we experience some of that large temperature difference.  during a midwest summer, the same thing happens except that the arctic is now also experiencing summer. northern canada is now warmer so there might only be a 40f difference between northern canada and the equator. the midwest still experiences some cooler air traveling down from the north, but it isn't nearly as cool, so we don't experience nearly as large a difference in temperature.  the other factor involved is exactly where the cold arctic air and the warm tropical air meet. in the winter, they meet much further south while in the summer they meet farther north. this boundary is basically the polar front jet stream, which you can see from this [diagram](https://climate.ncsu.edu/images/edu/polar_front_summer_winter.jpg) is located further south in the winter. you can view the current jet stream maps [here](http://squall.sfsu.edu/gif/jetstream_init_00.gif). you can compare that to this [map](http://www.intellicast.com/national/temperature/current.aspx) which shows generally warmer temperatures south of the jet stream and colder temperatures north of the jet stream.

74183	0	a	[study here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0308597x19303677)  abstract: the period from 2019 to 2020 is critical in determining whether the world trade organization (wto), tasked with eliminating capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies, can deliver to the world an agreement that will discipline subsidies that lead to overfishing. here, following extensive data collection efforts, we present an update of the current scope, amount and analysis of the level of subsidisation of the fisheries sector worldwide. we estimate global fisheries subsidies at usd 35.4 billion in 2018, of which capacity-enhancing subsidies are usd 22.2 billion. the top five subsidising political entities (china, european union, usa, republic of korea and japan) contribute 58% (usd 20.5 billion) of the total estimated subsidy. the updated global figure has decreased since the most recent previous estimate from 2009, of usd 41.4 billion in 2018 constant dollars. the difference between these two estimates can be largely explained by improvements in methodology and the difference in the actual amount of subsidies provided. thus, we consider direct statistical comparison of these numbers to be inappropriate. having said that, the difference between the estimates suggest that the increase in fisheries subsidies provided in the preceding decades may have halted. still, the bulk of harmful ‘capacity-enhancing’ subsidies, particularly those for fossil fuels have actually increased as a proportion of total subsidies. as such, for the benefit of marine ecosystems, and current and future generations of people, all hands must be on deck in helping the wto reach a meaningful agreement to discipline subsidies that lead to overcapacity and overfishing.

71355	0	a	hawking was an excellent scientist, and just about anyone working in physics today would be happy to have his record of accomplishments. his primary contributions were in the area of black hole mechanics, including the singularity theorems and hawking radiation. he also did a great deal of interesting  theoretical work in cosmology, but we don't currently have any way of telling whether the models he proposed are correct.  with that said, i don't think we can call stephen hawking one of the all-time greats like einstein, newton, or maxwell, who revolutionized multiple unrelated fields of physics. his work was significantly more localized in subject matter and theoretical, and most of it has not been empirically confirmed (although his black hole research is almost certain to be correct).  of course, his contributions as an explainer of science to the public and as an ambassador for scientists as a group should not be neglected. but they do give some people the impression that he was even greater than he actually was as a physicist.

(with the exception of one who answered my response back to them - and i thank them)    i am new here.  i posted my article to wiki.   the first administrator came along and made a minor change to my title.   i had modeled my after multiple examples of others in the same industry as posted to wiki - but not really a big concern to me. happy to learn best practice and perhaps the other 5 articles are not good examples.    i then had a user flag my article for speedy delete.   very quickly - a second administrator deleted my article.  if i'm reading the chain correctly - it was deleted something like less than 10 minutes after flagged.   no one notified me. no one gave me the opportunity to make changes or instructions as to where the specific problem was.    per the """"item deleted"""" page that suggests you work with the other parties involved, i first contacted the user that flagged my article and the administrator who deleted it.  the user said his concern was that it sounded to him like advertising and noted on what points.  i wrote a very detailed response to him telling why the information he noted was presented as it was, addressing his source concerns, etc..   he has not followed up with me - i assume that means no problem with my response?  or perhaps busy doing other things.    i also forwarded the defense response to the administrator who deleted my file.   before sending the him points of defense (i was still drafting), he did send me a note saying it was an """"advertising"""" concern.  he pointed me to a general help page (which i'd already read) and a page where i could retrieve the original version of my article.  combined with the point to the article - and no reply to my defense - i took this to mean go again with it.    i reposted the article - and had another user flag it for advertising - but no specific information.  i removed the tag per the box's instruction that i could do so as long as working on resolving the problem.  i responded to the flagger in great detail and requested specific feedback.  (which was then deleted and marked as too much detail) i replied again in a more brief response.   i added the hang on notation.    i am now addressing you because you have deleted my article - without any comment or notice to me.  i assure you that i am not being difficult - but am very frustrated with the lack of interaction and guidance i am receiving here.  it seems easy to hit a delete - but of little interest to provide anything specific like assistance.  am i wrong to assume administrators are supposed to be a source for information and assistance - wiki mentors if you will.  my experience on my first day using wiki has been that administrators shoot first - and don't care in the least about even asking questions later.  in fact - they will ignore them.    i do not believe you could have read the contents of the talk page in the period of time lapse between the flag and your delete.   i expect that before deleting my article - one would check the talk page and see if the matter is being addressed.  this is what the flag box assures me that is wiki policy to do.  i have extensive notes on the article sources and answered all questions in a very timely fashion - but i cannot understand why i seem to be the only person following a procedure.    i hope this is simply a matter of catching a couple of administrators on """"off"""" days.  i am very frustrated with the lack of administrators following what i understand to be their own policies.   please review my talk page and advise.  i also respectfully request that you reinstate my article. i await your response."""

57858	0	a	i don’t agree with this. much longer and nobody could do it in an hour unless they had every single motion effect already saved as a preset and a very very detailed plan (which would take its own amount of time). this is assuming they’re only using premier and not waiting for after effects to do stuff. at minimum i’d give a pro 5 minutes per effect/cut so if there’s 100 then a little over 8 hours. and some of those scenes are pretty complicated like the 3x3 dark iphones. you basically have to look e up timing on 9 videos at once which is tedious.   source: i edit videos for a living.

71851	0	a	> why is it that linux allows my to use my os while updating while requiring no reboot?  it doesn't.  certain updates do require a reboot, just as with any other os. if you want to change your kernel or bootloader, most distributions will require a reboot.  it is possible to replace a running kernel while running, but most distributions don't bother supporting that as a means of updating. it's also still a very good idea to reboot. why? because you need to make sure your computer **will** boot. otherwise when it does reboot, it might not come back up cleanly. better to find and fix now than when a hardware component fails.  also, updating major software components while running may produce strange results. some applications load everything they need into memory when they launch, and they will happily carry on even if you pull the binary out from under them. many applications include dynamic plugins, resource files on disk, configurations, etc. those applications are not going to do so well when something changes.

(smile back)   i rather disagree with you, but in a friendly way (i hate edit-war nonsense). i think it's possible to create links without necessarily making page titles—and there really are some atrocious ones about ('ladislas the posthumous' being one of them, in my opinion)—appear on the page in question.   it is certainly possible and reasonable to call albert """"king of the germans"""" or """"german king"""" (the germans themselves use the term """"römisch-deutscher könig"""", which covers it nicely. but even here on english wikipedia, where there are many mistakes in this matter, the term """"king of germany"""" is rarely used. of course there was a germany at that time in the sense of a german-speaking volk,  but there was not a german kingdom in the sense of a political state ruled by a royal government (when a later king of the romans, ferdinand i, tried to administer hungary and bohemia from vienna, he was rebuffed— and he wouldn't have even tried that much in principalities where he was not the dynastic prince, such as saxony or brandenburg); the nearest thing to a german kindom, the carolingian kingdom of the east franks (even that has been called the kingdom of germany only as a back-formation), had fragmented fairly quickly into a group of states with their own princes (in the case of bohemia, an actual king). albert ii is an interesting case because in his purely german-speaking territories he was only a duke. his kingdoms of bohemia and hungary, though part of the holy roman empire, were largely non-german, which is another reason why rex romanorum is correct and not """"king of germany"""".  the english wikipedia article on the subject is very inaccurate, announcing the academically unjustifiable decision to use the term """"kingdom of germany"""" for clarification's sake. in my opinion, having had this stuff drummed into me at university, where i had to read texts in latin and german, that doesn't so much clarify as blur the issue. the title """"king of the romans"""" may be difficult, and so may the idea of a group of independent german (and non-german) states within the holy roman empire, but the readers of wikipedia, in my opinion, shouldn't have history revised for them to make it fit the modern world (and austria still isn't the same country as germany anyway). fortunately, the  articles on this subject on german wikipedia use the correct terminology.

54615	0	a	my dog went blind last march. she always loved her squeaky balls (santa just brought her more) so we have a modified game of catch. i take her out to the driveway, which is a good amount of space where she can run around knowing she won't bump into anything, and i run in circles squeaking the ball and she actually runs at a good clip after me, following the sound. then i stop and roll the ball towards her and she puts her front paws out and waits for it. most of the time i intentionally miss, bouncing it off her so she can sense which direction it went and sniff it out like a bloodhound. she loves the hunt of the ball and it builds her confidence.  when it comes time to play ball i squeak it inside the house and she squeals and squeals with happiness and heads for the door just like when she could see.  i also bought her one of those doggie strollers so i can take her for walks and get her out of the house. i take her out of the stroller along the way and she can still walk a little bit here and there, sniffing everything in sight. then we stroll around and she barks like mad at the other dogs who bark at her which basically seems to give her life.  when i drive to our usual walking places she recognizes where we're going according to direction and gets excited. she even stands up and puts her head out the window, which she actually rarely ever did when she could still see. the first time i saw her do that, post-blindness, i could have died with joy.  good luck with your doggie. i know it's really sad, and sometimes i have a good cry about it. somehow we muddle through and have our good days and bad. maybe yours won't lose all of her sight. my dog lost hers very rapidly but still had about 20% in one eye for the final three days and was still able to get by quite well at that point with only that little vision. also, if yours is losing her sight at a slower rate maybe she'll be able to adapt more easily.  p.s. sorry for the lengthy tl;dr! i think i'm wired for christmas or something.  edit: thanks ever so much to the kind stranger who gave me my first gold on this christmas day! : )    :  )     :  )

72782	0	a	"this is by no means my area of expertise buuuuuuut here goes nothing.   short answer: like most generalizations about medieval history, it may be broadly true but overlooks change over time and specific nuances that in fact tell a fairly interesting story about the creation of certain institutions. the background for this is the end of the roman legal system (which in its own way gave power to those with a legal education or the money to access one, to a level that might outstrip the power imbalance of medieval european law) and the creation of the germanic legal systems (sometimes, as in the case of the visigoths, with roman holdovers) in the post-roman west.   one of the major themes of medieval history (which has been treated at length in the historiography of the period) is the transition from what we might call personal or charismatic law to a system of law that we might see as more modern: nominally impartial, with rights of appeal, etc. this situation is complicated by the fact that the medieval period had many different types of law. even more than differing national (in the modern, anachronistic sense) laws (e.g., the law of england vs france vs each little part of the empire) there were overlapping spheres of law. in visigothic spain, for instance, there were different ethnic laws for romans, goths, jews, although how this worked in practice is still up for debate. similarly, in al-andalus there were complicated rules about who could appeal to which courts in which cases. there were also conflicts between the church law (canon law) and the secular laws of the lords, which often but not always expressed itself in the debate over what scholars today call ""the papal monarchy.""  with the caveats above--that there are overlapping systems of laws, and that things worked differently in different places, and at different times--we can make some broad arguments about the shift from personal law to institutionalized law. this is tied in with the question of the growth of the administrative state. the simplest argument is that as governments got more complicated and needed things like continuity and cohesiveness, all sorts of things started to happen--taxes needed to be collected, records needed to be kept, plans needed to be made--and all of these eventually created the conditions for centralization and standardization of power. at this time you also see the rebirth of a literate culture, what we sometimes refer to as the ""documentary revolution."" furthermore, the ""rediscovery"" of roman law at the university of bologna and its spread over the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries provided a model for even those places (like england) which did not adopt roman law. by the time of the fourth lateran council (1215) you had the idea that law needed to be universalized and rationalized, and thus you get the end of things like trial by ordeal.  it is in fact much more complicated than this. part of this is because of the different levels of hierarchy. an interesting case is england, as described in strayer's short but thought-provoking *medieval origins of the modern state*. strayer makes the point that the establishment of many of the things we take for granted in law today--jury trials, appeal, etc.-- came out of royal attempts to undercut the arbitrary power of local lords, and was tied up with the push for more efficient tax collection and the creation of the exchequer. so yes, while in this case there was a move away from what we might call arbitrary personal law (but really--customary law) administered by local lords, the centralization and rationalization (i hate that word) of the law actually served to increase the power of another lord--the king.    here are some good classic sources: bartlett, robert. *trial by fire and by water*  bisson, thomas. *the crisis of the twelfth century.*  cheyette, frederick. “the invention of the state.” in essays on medieval civilization, ed. bede karl lackner and kenneth roy philp. austin: university of texas press, 1978.  clanchy, m. t. *from memory to written record*. 1993. 2 ed.   miller, william ian. *bloodtaking and peacemaking: feud, law, and society in saga iceland*. chicago: university of chicago press, 1990.  strayer, j.r. *on the medieval origins of the modern state*. princeton, 1970  "

dc9627d0247866a9	1	a	what a hypocrite this creep chavez is!  from the main article about hugo chavez:  chávez was raised a roman catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the venezuelan catholic hierarchy and protestant groups like the new tribes mission. he has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. he often invokes god and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked venezuelans to pray for fidel castro's health.  i find it ironic that an atheist such as hugo chavez would ask the venezuelan people to pray to god for another atheist's (fidel castro) health! this just shows what a hypocrite and liar chavez is!

94381565df5644cf	0	a	the comparison of shotokan and wado is foolishly done. master gigo funakoshi experimented with attacking from the heel and hitting with the ball(cresent kicking) but left those as options, not as official technique. grandmaster gichin funakoshi and master gigo mainly focused on moving and pivoting on the ball for great speed and easier hitting of higher parts as well as lower. the linear stance in most karate(aside from goju, kyukushin, and kempo(kenpo means law of the sword and is a mistranslation...of course language is weak and abstract...) is the initial stance to emphasize the kick as the primary attack in the attack, defense, or counter of an opponent; the beginning of most combos. watch lyoto machida for example. machida karate is a return to the classical values and techniques of original shotokan. he thrusts from the ball of the foot and when not attacking rests on the heel to conserve energy because it is a sport fight. where wado differs is in its greater emphasis on jujitsu and the wrestling in it that judo mostly abandoned. shotokan barrowed more from judo. just look at the belt system developed by grandmaster jiguro kano and his friendship with grandmaster gichin funakoshi.

71139ef5b18eb352	0	a	"""  definition  tabin this proposal, i will discuss why the wikipedia definition for “probability,” is not a good, valid definition, and needs to be changed. probability is something that is used every day. it is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain. however, in order to further our knowledge of probability, we must truly understand the definition of the word first. according to wikipedia, there is not a clear, valid definition for probability, and i propose to change this.  user:nparibello-njitwill/summer 2012 | probability  tabthe given wikipedia definition is as follows: probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.[1] the proposition of interest is usually of the form """"will a specific event occur?"""" the attitude of mind is of the form """"how certain are we that the event will occur?"""" the certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number, between 0 and 1, we call probability.[2] the higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur. thus, probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a (random)event will occur.  the opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is. it begins with, “probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.” the word ordinarily is not only ambiguous, but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about. aside from the ambiguity, the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well. although i am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree, but also on my own to further my knowledge, i still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant. i would not consider probability an attitude of mind, because this simply does not make sense. the “proposition of interest” and “attitude of mind” are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability. probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event.  tabthe given wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is, rather than defining it. it states that, “the proposition of interest is usually of the form…” this is not only an example instead of a definition, but it is an extremely poor example. the word usually is very vague, leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time. the definition also ends with probability in an applied sense. but what does that really mean? because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to, this makes the definition unclear. tabthe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between 0 and 1. for anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense, this definition most likely makes little sense. the way it is written is very vague, but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from 0 (the event will definitely not occur), to 1 (the event will definitely occur). these ranges are also often written in percent form, 0% to 100%. i believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages, the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid. the range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome. while this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability, i would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense, even though definitions should not include examples. for example, the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is .5, or 50%. this is because there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and both are equally likely. if the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides, the probability of landing heads would be 1, or 100%, since there are no other possible outcomes. as stated in the original definition, “the higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur.”  tabtwo good quality sources comes from richard l. sheaffer in his book, introduction to probability and its applications, and glenn shaffer in his book probability and finance. both sheaffer and shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges, including njit. both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability, making them two of the best sources for this proposal. from a mathematical standpoint, richard sheaffer states that “probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number p(a) to every event a so that the following axioms hold: p(a) >= 0, and p(s) = 1.” glenn shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy, les"

73558	0	a	not a stupid question at all. while trump announced his desire to withdraw, many other groups and individuals in the us, such as states like california, individual cities and businesses can still adhere to more stringent emissions goals, for example. individual states do have environmental laws that are more stringent than federal regulations, so even if they were rolled back nationally, states such as ca and ny are still adhering to these climate targets.   individual companies as well are moving towards clean energy, even energy companies like exxon mobil (in fact, trump's secretary of state, for exxon mobil ceo rex tillerson, acknowledged the effects of man-made climate change and how exxon mobil postured itself accordingly...so he quite literally is opposing trump on this issue) the cost of solar power has dropped substantially over the past several years so economically there is a stronger case against coal, and the solar power industry even employs more americans than the coal industry  the real impact will probably be in the respect that the us has on the global scene, or more specifically, how trump is viewed globally. with the *entire* world behind the agreement, he stands as much of an outlier. this is now an opportunity for other nations to claim the mantle as the global leader on environmentalism.   i'm cautiously optimistic. not optimistic for the planet as much as i am optimistic for the future of the agreement. i think there is too much of a push *for* more stringent climate regulations in the us for  this withdrawal to hurt our progress

59520	0	a	not a shark expert by any stretch, but most animals have evolved communication of some kind, whether conscious or not - especially those who have communities, as sharks do. dolphins chatter and have extensive body language; fish use body language and also colour and chemical signals. sharks might be somewhere in that spectrum?  it's reasonable to assume that since they live in groups, and communication typically favours survival of both group and individual genes, they have likely evolved with some kind of communication.  now i want to google shark language 😄  edit: basic googling tells me that they don't have any throat organs that can produce sound - they are a perfectly silent hunter. scientists have established that they use complex body language to send signals around mating and group hierarchy. they also use their strong sense of smell, which is on the level of chemical communication. researchers who study specific schools report recognition on the part of those they are studying. til: sharks are neat!

71769	0	a	"oh shoot!  as a geoscientist and a huge subnautica fan, i'm sorry to come in late on this.  **no**, the lava depicted in the lava zone is completely unrealistic (but *so* cool.)  let me comment on the pieces of the answer that people have already given:  as /u/little_mouse points out, real underwater volcanism on earth doesn't have much glow to it: the water cools the lava so fast that it's almost all dark except for a few glints of red.  their video was taken at shallow depth by a scuba diver: here's a video from 1 km deep, similar to the lava zone in subnautica:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmmlspnozms  no glowing pools, no red lava falls.  water is a fantastic reservoir for heat, and the fact that warm water rises lets it carry away heat by convection really *really* well.  /u/presidentrex has a great analysis of pressures and the phase diagram of water, but there's one thing they didn't realize: **hot supercritical water is always less dense than cold**, as shown in the graphs [here](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_density.html).  thus, there will be no ""stable layer of supercritical water"": it would be buoyant, rise, and be replaced by cool water, carrying away heat by convection.  what if the layer of water near the lava surface had a ton of salts dissolved in it, so it was denser?  as /u/bassmanbiff points out, the thermal radiation law applies to *everything*, not just rock: the supercritical water layer *itself* would glow.  but that's clearly not what we see in subnautica, and in any case the water above this layer would still convect, rapidly cooling it just as if it were lava itself.  finally, as /u/uniqueuserthesecond points out, there's a thermometer in the game, and it reads 70 degrees c in the active lava zone.  that's probably a reasonable temperature, actually -- note that in the video i linked to, the submersible isn't damaged by the volcano's heat, and /u/little_mouse 's video was taken by a scuba diver swimming just a few feet from the lava!  but this is nowhere near the temperature at which stuff starts to glow -- no matter what stuff.  as a side note, several people are commenting on air pressure and o2.  one thing's for sure: the way subnautica handles air and breathing at depth is completely wrong, and trying to dive the way you can in subnautica would kill you dead.  nobody in the real world has done a dive on pressurized gas to a depth greater than 700 meters, the people who've done it to a depth below 100 meters only do so with hours of preparation, a special gas mixture, and slow cautious pressure changes, and even then many people who've tried to dive below 300 meters have died.  the vehicles and seabases behave as if they are at sea-level pressure (if they weren't, they wouldn't implode if you take them too deep), but you can't just hop from 800 meters of pressure into your sea-level pressure vehicle without dying immediately.  and let's not even talk about how moonpools work....  of course, a realistic approach to lava and air pressure wouldn't make for nearly as fun a game!"

[quote] that doesn't make her """"dangerous behavior"""" a way to wink and say, """"well, she got what she deserved"""".  [/quote]   i never implied that gwen deseved to be murdered, and that is a sick contention of your part! gwen clearly engaged in behavior that put her at great risk of someone raping, killing or beating her. when the transgendered do not have a support system in place, and by that i mean qualified professionals as well as understanding friends and family, they are at great risk. gwen's family, as well as friends, were no doubt sympathetic and loving, but gwen had no other support or therapy. gwen should have been in a support group at the very least, and perhaps been transitioning after therapy before attempting to passing in public, which is very dangerous in most places no matter how passable the person is or believes themselves to be. yes, these guys are scum, and thats even more reason to take any motivation they claim with a grain of salt. but the bottom line is: gwen should have been more cautious.   and lets honsetly answer the question once and for all: was gwen wrong in not revealing her gender status before having anal sex with some of these men (and it has been widely reported that it was anal not oral sex!). i find it impossible to believe that if it was indeed oral sex that not one of these purported hetrosexual males made a boob grab! this whole situation does not pass the smell test!

2c2e689902056a51	0	a	i strongly disagree whith your opinion, but since i'm clearly outnumbered i'll accept your decision; in my opinion, the most information it's removed, the least useful this article becomes: the only “opening year” isn't really relevant, if it's taken individually - and despite being stable data, they're alike questionable (at least for early systems) - and this way even the sortability of the table   becomes pointless: it'll be more rational to revert the article to a mere, simple list as it was before march 2013 (if i correctly saw in the “history”). conversely, the reader's usefulness of collecting statistic data in such a global list is far bigger than adding that to a nationwide/continental list: if you're interested in some specific system you can go directly to their individial wiki pages, while if you aim to a world overview, it's somewhat tiring to “search, open & match” a handful of different article. don't take it to heart, but i don't intend to further contribute to this list: good luck with your project, but from my personal point of view as reader/user it doesn't worth the needed time and effort.

1d78f2b2ec7f1eeb	0	a	hi elen, apart from chewing your ear for the first deletion tag i have generally seen your own actions as even handed and i would extend this comment to a few of the other editors, all who disagreed with my view but after seeing how wikipedia works internally i confess to being little else than disgusted at the sheer stupidity involved and i point that criticism at the mechanics of the successful removal of the page stub for jwasm i bothered to write for wikipedia. the same antagonist tried to trash the masm page that i rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. an earlier editor tried to get some content into the masm page by scouring the masm32 web site and linking to web pages that i wrote for the masm32 user base and while i was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the masm page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction i will simply resolve the problem from outside wikipedia. you are correct in the idea of taking the bat home but it goes further, pulling the stumps and taking the ball and stumps as well then ploughing the field and leaving the mess for the antagonist to clean up. regards and thanks for your efforts.

6aa335ec43f88c31	0	a	hi! thank you for adding a reference...but...   a recent addition of a reference is a good contribution, however the editor that added it was correct, it need not be cited (although the excuse that there are enough is not the reason). it is an undisputable fact, one which is well known enough that an inline citation for the fact alone is not required(it is douptful that it would be disputed). dating and any specific peice of information might require such just for varifiabilty, but just stating that ryan is the presumptive pick by romney is not controversial. additional information would require further referencing if more detail is used. thanks! always to sides to any discussion!

66075	0	a	please bear with the first bit of this as i establish a framework understanding.  machines execute machine code. compilers do *not* compile directly to machine code. they compile the code into to *assembly* which is then *assembled* into machine code.  machine code has two parts, ~~zero and one~~ operands (what to do and where (registers) to do it\*) and data. depending on the number of 'bits' the machine is, these can all have varying lengths of bits.  now that we understand what machine code is and how it's structured, let's look at what assembly code is.  assembly code is *human readable machine code*.  we (humans) give the operands *mnemonics* (names) and logically divide this into three parts to make things easier to remember for us. no matter what, the same operand mnemonic will *always* turn into the same sequence of binary.   so assembly let's us turn a 'line' of binary from      010011110101000001010010 010100100100010101000111 01000100010000010101010001000001  into      opr reg, data  so now we know what assembly is, and how it's written. how does a machine turn assembly into machine code?  why with an assembler of course! usually assemblers are 'programmed' on paper, by hand writing the assembly you would normally type to later be run through an assembler. the next step is. . . translating the assembly of your assembler to binary yourself! hooray how exciting!  even still we keep it a bit more human readable than direct binary we use a system called hexadecimal to represent binary. a symbol of hex is four bits, and is as follows.      0 0000     1 0001     2 0010     3 0011      ...     f 1111   once you have your program translated from assembly to hex, you queue the program in a hex editor. a hex editor is a peripheral attached to the machine which stores the binary of your program which you enter using hex, and sends it to be executed once you are finished.  so, now we understand how we get machines to do anything. let's see how we can reach the ability to compile a compiler.  1) hand write an assembler in assembly/hex.  2) enter your assembler into a machine with a hex editor  3) write your compiler in assembly and assemble it.  4) write your compiler in the language your compiler compiles.  5) assemble the compiler.  6) goto 4  that's how you get a basic compiler.   fun fact: a compiler written in the language it compiles is called a *self-hosting compiler*.   ***  things you may want to dig into for further reading.  linkers (part of modern compilers, much the same way an assembler is one part of a modern compiler)  assemblers  intel syntax vs at&t syntax  machine organization (you can't write working assembly unless you know what is where and how it works)  endianess (relevant to the structure of machine code)  bitwise operations (extremely low level data manipulation functions)  cisc and risc (machine architecture paradigms)  forth (a super early language that blurs the line high and low level software)  gcc (gnu compiler suite)  source: hobbyist embedded developer.  i hope this adequately answers the question op!

59644	0	a	when i was a kid there was this old lady next door. not gonna lie, she was my best friend for a couple of years. this is when my parents and i moved to a different country and i didn't know anybody. i'm extremely allergic to cats and she had 4 of them, so whenever i used to go to her house my face would puff up and i couldn't breathe properly but despite that, i would continue to go until we finally moved. damn, thinking about this now brings a tear to my eye especially since i know she has passed away by now because she was like 90 back then. wherever you are now anne, i hope you know that you made some of the hardest years of my life bearable and that you will always hold a special place in my heart.

72691	0	a	"> how much of naval combat was ship on ship actions like ramming? there were obviously people on the vessels but how much of an impact did archers, marines, etc. play in the grand scheme of a battle?  the two forms of naval combat existed side by side, with thucydides (probably wrongly) describing boarding action as old-fashioned and ramming as innovative and sophisticated. the main thing was that ramming tactics required room to manoeuvre, as well as carefully managed formations to prevent confusion. it was typically the prerogative of well-trained crews in open-sea battles. in tighter quarters such as harbours or inlets, boarding was a more likely approach. the athenians, who prided themselves on their naval expertise, had fairly lightly crewed triremes with just 4 archers and 10 deck-fighters; other states sometimes crammed 30 or more fighting men on their decks. both during ramming and boarding, missile troops on deck played an important role in harassing and picking off their counterparts on the enemy's ships and ideally being a nuisance to the rowers in the hull.  > are there any actual records of giant melees in battles that weren’t a rout?  giant melees were a very bad thing if they occurred in battle, because they meant a total loss of oversight and control. most hand-to-hand combat occurred along the line of opposing formations. only rarely, in the case of encirclements or confused fighting, would greek warriors face enemies on multiple sides in chaotic melee. in these cases, ""friendly fire"" was a common occurrence and panic was likely to result.

([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orbital_eccentricity#definition))  arcsin(0.0068) = 0.39º  arcsin(0.017) = 0.97º  a circle tilted off-face by less than 1 degree is not going to look appreciably distorted.

72771	0	a	"okay, i think i can put this together semi-coherently.  among sixteenth-century holy women and men (saints, wannabe saints, nuns, monks, unaffiliated mystics), there is a particularly spanish tradition of shedding one's family name to indicate belonging to god instead of an earthly family. so, for example, the dutch jesuit-saint peter canisius (latinized *kanis*) kept his father's name when he joined the society of jesus, and italian dominican alessandra de ricci changed her *first* name in honor of catherine of siena but kept the de ricci family name. but juan de yepes y Álvarez changed his name to juan de san mateo upon joining the carmelite order, and went a step further when founding his own stricter monastery, taking on the appellation juan de la cruz--john of the cross. and teresa sánchez de cepeda y ahumada might be better known today as teresa of avila thanks to the location of her convent, but her autobiography is the life of st. teresa of jesús.  it's not a rule, of course. francis xavier is known by his family's *castle*. but a look at the inquisition records of visionaries and prophets from ~1600 seville indicates the popularity in spain of taking on a second name to show possession by god: ana de los santos, antonia de san francisco (a member of the franciscan order), barbara de jesús, juan de jesús ,  caterina de jesús, maria de la concepcion, mariana de jesús.  much of the religious care in the new world was carried out by members of religious orders like the dominicans and franciscans, who, in line with that tradition, were big fans of taking on the names of preferred saints or other religioius things. this religious care included baptism, which brought with it the bestowal of christian names on mexican native populations.  in rebecca horn's studies of naming patterns among the nahua as recorded in 16th-17th century census and other records, she traces the gradual triumph of christian names of nahuatl ones. through the mid 16th century, christian records show a common pattern of a christian first name and nahuatl second name for both women and men. in the second half of the century, the pattern starts to slip among women. nahuatl names fall away, being replaced by spanish first and second names; men mostly retain the spanish first, nahuatl second. horn insinuates that the growing gender differentiation may reflect a shift from the *use* of nahuatl names to spanish ones, but i probably digress.  more relevant here is that in the 17th century, spanish first and second baptismal names have become the rule for both women and men. frequently, although not exclusively, the baptizing friar would bestow their own ""de [santx]"" name. sometimes, especially later in the century, they would follow the pattern of choosing a christocentric christian devotion (de la cruz, de jesus) instead of their patron saint.  one of horn's really interesting observations is the growth of a class divide among the nahua population in the 17th century. upper-class mexicans continued to keep the ""de/de la"" form of the name. its use faded among the lower classes in favor of the simplified name.  so gradually, religious women and men shunning their earthly family names for a divine family became the baptismal names bestowed by a missionary friar. it's clearer to me why upper-class mexicans would have preferred to preserve the ""de"", but less so why it faded otherwise. nevertheless, that's the basic progression of the name jesus from the talisman-like ""ihs"" with quasi-magical powers of the 15th century, to the popular first name jesús by 1700."

66460	0	a	"a lot of answers here are ""electricity is produced at 60hz in the united states""  but none of them are answering why this is the case,  the frequency of ac mains power is selected to give synchronous motors attached to grid power directly good operating characteristics. that is, stuff like vacuum cleaners, washing machines, fans for air systems etc.  these are most electric motors that plug into the wall that don't have a special power distribution mechanism built in, those that do have this kind of frequency controller hardware are called variable frequency drives and are often used where the speed of the drive needs to vary rapidly.  vfds are limited to industrial use for the most part.  *****  the reason the frequency matters for synchronous motors has to do with the physical design of alternating current motors and the geometry, but the simple explanation is that for simple synchronous motors the speed of the motor in rpms is dependent on the supplied frequency because the physical rotation of the motor is being driven by the rotation of a magnetic field and the magnetic field is going to rotate at the frequency of the alternating current in ac synchronous motors.  if we imagine the motor in its most simple state as a set of magnets with a single north and south pole on the rotating part of the motor (the rotor) and a single north and south pole on the stationary part of the motor (the stator).    our ac mains power drives the stator magnets, and the magnets on the rotor is a fixed magnet, the rotor spins in normal operation as the poles on the stator switch positions, and the permanent magnet moves to correct its alignment.  with only one set of poles, the rotor speed will match the mains power speed, making one full rotation for each full cycle of switch in polarity.  in real motors the speed will be some multiple of the frequency because multiple poles are used as they provide better torque.  because of this 60 hz in the us, and 50 hz is europe was selected because it allows motor designers to easily build motors that will operate at safe speeds and torques when connected to mains power.  edit: added information about how poles work in a motor "

68580	0	a	"as other comments have pointed out, harvard ""meets need"" with financial aid and students from poor families can and do finish four years there with little to no debt.  when i taught high school, i tried to encourage some of my students to apply to schools like harvard and they often refused to do so because they thought it would be too expensive. in part this was because of their parents discouraging them from going anywhere out of state for a variety of reasons. people really don't like their kids moving away. but a larger part is that my students lacked information and the ability to envision themselves going to a place like harvard. when i tried to explain the financial aid situation, i got a lot of push back from students and parents.  a great deal of motivation comes down to the power to imagine possibilities. i grew up in a poor community and i have had people fight me tooth and nail when i suggest they have potential or that there are opportunities for them elsewhere."
